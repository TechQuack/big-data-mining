32103758/Naringin provides neuroprotection in CCL2-induced cognition impairment by attenuating neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus Background Chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) is one of the most widely recognised proinflammatory chemokines in cognitive disorders. Currently, CCL2-targeting drugs are extremely limited. Thus, this study aimed to explore the neuroprotection afforded by naringin in CCL2-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Methods Before the CCL2 intra-hippocampal injection, rats were treated with naringin for 3 consecutive days via intraperitoneal injection. Two days post-surgery, the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NORT) tests were performed to detect spatial learning and memory and object cognition, respectively. Nissl staining and dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining were performed to assess histopathological changes in the hippocampus. Commercial kits were used to measure the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the relative mRNA expression of interleukin 1beta, (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 8 (caspase-8), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 3 (caspase-3), cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax). Results In the MWM, the average escape latency and average swimming distance were significantly reduced and the crossing times were increased in the naringin-treated groups, compared with the CCL2 group. The NORT results revealed that, compared with the CCL2 rats, the discrimination index in the naringin-treated rats increased significantly. Nissl and TUNEL staining revealed that naringin protected the structure and survival of the neurons in the CA1 zone of the hippocampus. In the naringin-treated groups, the SOD and GSH-Px activities were increased, whereas the MDA levels were decreased. Furthermore, in the naringin-treated groups, the relative mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 was significantly decreased; GLAST and GLT-1 mRNA expression levels were increased, whereas PAG was decreased. In the naringin-treated groups, the relative mRNA expression levels of caspase-8, caspase-3, and Bax were decreased, whereas that of Bcl-2 was increased. Conclusion Collectively, these data indicated that naringin alleviated the CCL2-induced cognitive impairment. The underlying mechanisms could be associated with the inhibition of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the regulation of glutamate metabolism.
32000299/Quercetin protects against diabetic encephalopathy via SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway in db/db mice Abstract Epidemiological studies have found that diabetes and cognitive dysfunction are closely related. Quercetin has been certified with the effect on improving diabetes mellitus (DM) and cognitive impairment. However, the effect and related mechanism of quercetin on diabetic encephalopathy (DE) are still ambiguous. In this study, we used the db/db mice (diabetic model) to discover whether quercetin could improve DE through the Sirtuin1/NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) pathway. Behavioural results (Morris water maze and new object recognition tests) showed that quercetin (70 mg/kg) improved the learning and memory. Furthermore, quercetin alleviated insulin resistance and the level of fasting blood glucose. Besides, Western blot analysis also showed that quercetin increased the protein expressions of nerve- and synapse-related protein, including postsynapticdensity 93 (PSD93), postsynapticdensity 95 (PSD95), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the brain of db/db mice. Quercetin also increased the protein expression of SIRT1 and decreased the expression of NLRP3 inflammation-related proteins, including NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC and cleaved Caspase-1, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18. In conclusion, the present results indicate that the SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway may be a crucial mechanism for the neuroprotective effect of quercetin against DE.
31970862/Inhibition of USP14 suppresses the formation of foam cell by promoting CD36 degradation Abstract Atherosclerosis is regarded as a chronic progressive inflammatory disease and is a basic pathophysiological process in coronary artery disease which is life threatening in clinic. The formation of foam cell plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. OxLDL is a significant factor in progression of coronary artery disease. Our studies have demonstrated that USP14 promotes cancer development and mediates progression of cardiac hypertrophy and LPS-induced inflammation. However, the underlying mechanism of USP14 is unknown. In this study, we found that the inhibition of USP14 significantly suppressed the oxLDL uptake, subsequently decreased the foam cell formation. Surprisingly, USP14 has an effect on the expression of CD36 but not SR-A, ABCA1, Lox-1, ABCG1 and SR-Bl. Furthermore, USP14 stabilizes CD36 protein via cleaving the ubiquitin chain on CD36. Blocking CD36 activation using antibody-dependent blocking assay remarkably attenuated the function of USP14 on the formation of foam cell. In summary, our results suggested that the inhibition of USP14 decreases foam cell formation by down-regulating CD36-mediated lipid uptake and provides a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.
31989795/Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate protects against Abeta-induced cell toxicity through regulating Abeta process Abstract Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) has been reported to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism is still unknown. In this study, two in vitro models, Abeta-treated SH-SY5Y cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected with APPsw (SH-SY5Y-APPsw cells), were employed to investigate the neuroprotective of STS. The results revealed that pretreatment with STS (1, 10 and 100 micromol/L) for 24 hours could protect against Abeta (10 micromol/L)-induced cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner in the SH-SY5Y cells. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate decreased the concentrations of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, NO and iNOS, while increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the SH-SY5Y cells. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate decreased the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in the SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, Western blot results revealed that the expressions of neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme were up-regulated in the SH-SY5Y cells after STS treatment. Furthermore, ELISA and Western blot results showed that STS could decrease the levels of Abeta. ELISA and qPCR results indicated that STS could increase alpha-secretase (ADAM10) activity and decrease beta-secretase (BACE1) activity. In conclusion, STS could protect against Abeta-induced cell damage by modulating Abeta degration and generation. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate could be a promising candidate for AD treatment.
31981312/The marine-derived furanone reduces intracellular lipid accumulation in vitro by targeting LXRalpha and PPARalpha Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated that commercially available lipid-lowering drugs cause various side effects; therefore, searching for anti-hyperlipidaemic compounds with lower toxicity is a research hotspot. This study was designed to investigate whether the marine-derived compound, 5-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methyl-4-butylfuran-2(5H)-one, has an anti-hyperlipidaemic activity, and the potential underlying mechanism in vitro. Results showed that the furanone had weaker cytotoxicity compared to positive control drugs. In RAW 264.7 cells, the furanone significantly lowered ox-LDL-induced lipid accumulation (~50%), and its triglyceride (TG)-lowering effect was greater than that of liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. In addition, it significantly elevated the protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which could be partially inhibited by LXR antagonists, GSK2033 and SR9243. In HepG2 cells, it significantly decreased oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation, enhanced the protein levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), ABCG5, ABCG8 and PPARalpha, and reduced the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (~32%). PPARalpha antagonists, GW6471 and MK886, could significantly inhibit the furanone-induced lipid-lowering effect. Furthermore, the furanone showed a significantly lower activity on the activation of the expression of lipogenic genes compared to T0901317. Taken together, the furanone exhibited a weak cytotoxicity but had powerful TC- and TG-lowering effects most likely through targeting LXRalpha and PPARalpha, respectively. These findings indicate that the furanone has a potential application for the treatment of dyslipidaemia.
32064746/Cardiac calcium dysregulation in mice with chronic kidney disease Abstract Cardiovascular complications are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD significantly affects cardiac calcium (Ca2+) regulation, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. The present study investigated the modulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in CKD mice. Echocardiography revealed impaired fractional shortening (FS) and stroke volume (SV) in CKD mice. Electrocardiography showed that CKD mice exhibited longer QT interval, corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, faster spontaneous activities, shorter action potential duration (APD) and increased ventricle arrhythmogenesis, and ranolazine (10 micromol/L) blocked these effects. Conventional microelectrodes and the Fluo-3 fluorometric ratio techniques indicated that CKD ventricular cardiomyocytes exhibited higher Ca2+ decay time, Ca2+ sparks, and Ca2+ leakage but lower [Ca2+]i transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ contents. The CaMKII inhibitor KN93 and ranolazine (RAN; late sodium current inhibitor) reversed the deterioration in Ca2+ handling. Western blots revealed that CKD ventricles exhibited higher phosphorylated RyR2 and CaMKII and reduced phosphorylated SERCA2 and SERCA2 and the ratio of PLB-Thr17 to PLB. In conclusions, the modulation of CaMKII, PLB and late Na+ current in CKD significantly altered cardiac Ca2+ regulation and electrophysiological characteristics. These findings may apply on future clinical therapies.
31990147/Lobetyolin induces apoptosis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting glutamine metabolism Abstract The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anti-cancer property of Lobetyolin on colorectal cancer and explore its potential mechanism. Lobetyolin was incubated with HCT-116 cells in the absence or presence of ASCT2 inhibitor Benser or p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-alpha. The levels of glutamine, glutamic acid, alpha-ketoglutarate, ATP and GSH were determined to measure the glutamine metabolism. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and TUNEL assay were applied to estimate the apoptotic condition. The levels of ASCT2 were examined by RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The expressions of cleaved-caspase-3, caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-7, caspase-7, cleaved-PARP, PARP, p53, p21, bax and survivin were detected using Western blot analysis. As a result, the treatment with Lobetyolin effectively induced apoptosis and glutamine metabolism in HCT-116 cells through ASCT2 signalling. The inhibition of ASCT2 reduced the glutamine-related biomarkers and augmented the apoptotic process. We further found that the effect of Lobetyolin on HCT-116 was related to the expressions of p21 and bax, and transportation of p53 to nucleus. The inhibition of p53 by Pifithrin-alpha promoted the inhibitory effect of Lobetyolin on ASCT2-mediated apoptosis. Lobetyolin also exerted anti-cancer property in nude mice. In conclusion, the present work suggested that Lobetyolin could induce the apoptosis via the inhibition of ASCT2-mediated glutamine metabolism, which was possibly governed by p53.
32052561/Cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells is involved with GPR30-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition Abstract Cisplatin is the major chemotherapeutic drug in gastric cancer, particularly in treating advanced gastric cancer. Tumour cells often develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, which seriously affects the efficacy of chemotherapy. GPR30 is a novel oestrogen receptor that is involved in the invasion, metastasis and drug resistance of many tumours. Targeting GPR30 has been shown to increase the drug sensitivity of breast cancer cells. However, few studies have investigated the role of GPR30 in gastric cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to be associated with the development of chemotherapeutic drug resistance. In this study, we demonstrated that GPR30 is involved in cisplatin resistance by promoting EMT in gastric cancer. GPR30 knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity of different gastric cancer (GC) cells to cisplatin and alterations in the epithelial/mesenchymal markers. Furthermore, G15 significantly enhanced the cisplatin sensitivity of GC cells while G1 inhibited this phenomenon. In addition, EMT occurred when AGS and BGC-823 were treated with cisplatin. Down-regulation of GPR30 with G15 inhibited this transformation, while G1 promoted it. Taken together, these results revealed the role of GPR30 in the formation of cisplatin resistance, suggesting that targeting GPR30 signalling may be a potential strategy for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy in gastric cancer.
32065498/Sanguinarine disrupts the colocalization and interaction of HIF-1alpha with tyrosine and serine phosphorylated-STAT3 in breast cancer Abstract Breast cancer is one leading cause of death in females, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Hypoxia is a key feature leading to tumour progression driven by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. The aim is to investigate the mechanism of HIF-1alpha and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) interaction and discover a compound to disrupt the interaction in breast cancer cells. The regulation pattern of HIF-1alpha and STAT3 was analysed in hypoxic TNBC cells and patient samples. The effects of a natural alkaloid, sanguinarine, on HIF-1alpha and STAT3 colocalization and interaction were evaluated in vitro and mouse xenograft models. We observed strong colocalization of HIF-1alpha, p-STAT3-Tyr and p-STAT3-Ser in TNBC patient samples. Sanguinarine could inhibit the nuclear colocalization and interaction of HIF-1alpha with p-STAT3-Tyr and p-STAT3-Ser in vivo and in vitro. Our results may bring insights to the HIF-1alpha/STAT3 interaction in breast cancers and suggest sanguinarine as a promising candidate for HIF-alpha/STAT3 inhibition.
32064748/Histamine deficiency facilitates coronary microthrombosis after myocardial infarction by increasing neutrophil-platelet interactions Abstract Neutrophil-platelet interactions are responsible for thrombosis as well as inflammatory responses following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While histamine has been shown to play a crucial role in many physiological and pathological processes, its effects on neutrophil-platelet interactions in thromboinflammatory complications of AMI remain elusive. In this study, we show a previously unknown mechanism by which neutrophil-derived histamine protects the infarcted heart from excessive neutrophil-platelet interactions and redundant arterial thrombosis. Using histamine-deficient (histidine decarboxylase knockout, HDC-/-) and wild-type murine AMI models, we demonstrate that histamine deficiency increases the number of microthrombosis after AMI, in accordance with depressed cardiac function. Histamine-producing myeloid cells, mainly Ly6G+ neutrophils, directly participate in arteriole thrombosis. Histamine deficiency elevates platelet activation and aggregation by enhancing Akt phosphorylation and leads to dysfunctional characteristics in neutrophils which was confirmed by high levels of reactive oxygen species production and CD11b expression. Furthermore, HDC-/- platelets were shown to elicit neutrophil extracellular nucleosomes release, provoke neutrophil-platelet interactions and promote HDC-expressing neutrophils recruitment in arteriole thrombosis in vivo. In conclusion, we provide evidence that histamine deficiency promotes coronary microthrombosis and deteriorates cardiac function post-AMI, which is associated with the enhanced platelets/neutrophils function and neutrophil-platelet interactions.
32048816/P53/PANK1/miR-107 signalling pathway spans the gap between metabolic reprogramming and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet Abstract High-fat diet (HFD) leads to obesity, type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and increases the coincidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Insulin resistance (IR) is considered as the 'common soil' of those diseases. Furthermore, people on HFD showed restrained glycolysis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation, which is the so-called metabolic reprogramming. However, the relationship between metabolic reprogramming and IR induced by HFD is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PANK1 and miR-107 were up-regulated in the liver tissue of mice on HFD for 16 weeks and involved in metabolic reprogramming induced by palmitate acid (PA) incubation. Importantly, miR-107 within an intron of PANK1 gene facilitated IR by targeting caveolin-1 in AML12 cells upon PA incubation. Moreover, we identify that HFD enhanced P53 expression, and activation of P53 with nutlin-3a induced PANK1 and miR-107 expression simultaneously in transcriptional level, leading to metabolic reprogramming and IR, respectively. Consistently, inhibition of P53 with pifithrin-alpha hydrobromide ameliorated PA-induced metabolic reprogramming and IR. Thus, our results revealing a new mechanism by which P53 regulate metabolism. In addition, the results distinguished the different roles of PANK1 and its intron miR-107 in metabolic regulation, which will provide more accurate intervention targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases.
32057178/LncRNA TUG1 alleviates cardiac hypertrophy by targeting miR-34a/DKK1/Wnt-beta-catenin signalling Abstract The current study was designed to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lncRNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice were treated by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyocytes were treated by phenylephrine (PE) to induce hypertrophic phenotype. Haematoxylin-eosin (HE), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to examine morphological alterations. Real-time PCR, Western blots and IF staining were used to detect the expression of RNAs and proteins. Luciferase assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to verify the interaction. It is revealed that TUG1 was up-regulated in the hearts of mice treated by TAC surgery and in PE-induced cardiomyocytes. Functionally, overexpression of TUG1 alleviated cardiac hypertrophy both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, TUG1 sponged and sequestered miR-34a to increase the Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) level, which eventually inhibited the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. In conclusion, the current study reported the protective role and regulatory mechanism of TUG1 in cardiac hypertrophy and suggested that TUG1 may serve as a novel molecular target for treating cardiac hypertrophy.
32068341/Melatonin attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through preservation of YAP expression Abstract There are increasing concerns related to the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin in the clinical setting. Recently, melatonin has been shown to exert a cardioprotective effect in various cardiovascular diseases, including cardiotoxic conditions. In this study, we examined the possible protective effects of melatonin on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and explored the underlying mechanisms related to this process. We found that in vitro doxorubicin treatment significantly decreased H9c2 cell viability and induced apoptosis as manifested by increased TUNEL-positive cells, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, as well as up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreased mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP). In vivo, five weeks of doxorubicin treatment significantly decreased cardiac function, as evaluated by echocardiography. TUNEL staining results confirmed the increased apoptosis caused by doxorubicin. On the other hand, combinational treatment of doxorubicin with melatonin decreased cardiomyocyte ROS and apoptosis levels, along with increasing MMP. Such doxorubicin-melatonin co-treatment alleviated in vivo doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. Western Blots, along with in vitro immunofluorescence and in vivo immunohistochemical staining confirmed that doxorubicin treatment significantly down-regulated Yes-associated protein (YAP) expression, while YAP levels were maintained under co-treatment of doxorubicin and melatonin. YAP inhibition by siRNA abolished the protective effects of melatonin on doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes, with reversed ROS level and apoptosis. Our findings suggested that melatonin treatment attenuated doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through preserving YAP levels, which in turn decreases oxidative stress and apoptosis.
32052937/AQP1 suppression by ATF4 triggers trabecular meshwork tissue remodelling in ET-1-induced POAG Abstract Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been observed in aqueous humour (AH) of POAG patients, resulting in an increase in the out-flow resistance of the AH. However, the underlining mechanisms remain elusive. Using established in vivo and in vitro POAG models, we demonstrated that water channel Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is down-regulated in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells upon ET-1 exposure, which causes a series of glaucomatous changes, including actin fibre reorganization, collagen production, extracellular matrix deposition and contractility alteration of TM cells. Ectopic expression of AQP1 can reverse ET-1-induced TM tissue remodelling, which requires the presence of beta-catenin. More importantly, we found that ET-1-induced AQP1 suppression is mediated by ATF4, a transcription factor of the unfolded protein response, which binds to the promoter of AQP1 and negatively regulates AQP1 transcription. Thus, we discovered a novel function of ATF4 in controlling the process of TM remodelling in ET-1-induced POAG through transcription suppression of AQP1. Our findings also detail a novel pathological mechanism and a potential therapeutic target for POAG.
31965715/Dracorhodin perchlorate inhibits osteoclastogenesis through repressing RANKL-stimulated NFATc1 activity Abstract Osteolytic skeletal disorders are caused by an imbalance in the osteoclast and osteoblast function. Suppressing the differentiation and resorptive function of osteoclast is a key strategy for treating osteolytic diseases. Dracorhodin perchlorate (D.P), an active component from dragon blood resin, has been used for facilitating wound healing and anti-cancer treatments. In this study, we determined the effect of D.P on osteoclast differentiation and function. We have found that D.P inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and resorbed pits of hydroxyapatite-coated plate in a dose-dependent manner. D.P also disrupted the formation of intact actin-rich podosome structures in mature osteoclasts and inhibited osteoclast-specific gene and protein expressions. Further, D.P was able to suppress RANKL-activated JNK, NF-kappaB and Ca2+ signalling pathways and reduces the expression level of NFATc1 as well as the nucleus translocation of NFATc1. Overall, these results indicated a potential therapeutic effect of D.P on osteoclast-related conditions.
32068951/Procyanidin B3 alleviates intervertebral disc degeneration via interaction with the TLR4/MD-2 complex Abstract As a chronic musculoskeletal degeneration disease, intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) has been identified as a crucial cause for low back pain. This condition has a prevalence of 80% among adults without effective preventative therapy. Procyanidin B3 (Pro-B3) is a procyanidin dimer, which is widely present in the human diet and has multiple functions, such as preventing inflammation. But the inhibiting effect of Pro-B3 in IVDD development is still no known. Thus, our study aimed to demonstrate the therapeutical effect of Pro-B3 in IVDD and explain the underlying mechanism. In vitro studies, human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were isolated and exposed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate IVDD development. Pro-B3 pre-treatment inhibited LPS-induced production of inflammation correlated factors such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Nitric oxide (NO). On the other hand, LPS-medicated extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown was blocked in Pro-B3 treated NP cells. Additionally, Pro-B3 treatment blocked the activation of NF-kappaB/toll-like receptor 4 pathway in LPS-exposed NP cells. Mechanistically, Pro-B3 could occupy MD-2's hydrophobic pocket exhibiting high affinity for LPS to intervene LPS/TLR4/MD-2 complex formation. In vivo, Pro-B3 treatment prevented the loss of gelatin NP cells and structural damage of annulus fibrosus in rat IVDD model. In brief, Pro-B3 is considered to be a treatment agent for IVDD.
31970877/Combined tazemetostat and MAPKi enhances differentiation of papillary thyroid cancer cells harbouring BRAF V600E by synergistically decreasing global trimethylation of H3K27 Abstract Clinical efficacy of differentiation therapy with mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (MAPKi) for lethal radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (RR-PTC) urgently needs to be improved and the aberrant trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) plays a vital role in BRAF V600E-MAPK-induced cancer dedifferentiation and drug resistance. Therefore, dual inhibition of MAPK and histone methyltransferase (EZH2) may produce more favourable treatment effects. In this study, BRAF V600E-mutant (BCPAP and K1) and BRAF-wild-type (TPC-1) PTC cells were treated with MAPKi (dabrafenib or selumetinib) or EZH2 inhibitor (tazemetostat), or in combination, and the expression of iodine-metabolizing genes, radioiodine uptake, and toxicity were tested. We found that tazemetostat alone slightly increased iodine-metabolizing gene expression and promoted radioiodine uptake and toxicity, irrespective of the BRAF status. However, MAPKi induced these effects preferentially in BRAF V600E mutant cells, which was robustly strengthened by tazemetostat incorporation. Mechanically, MAPKi-induced decrease of trimethylation of H3K27 was evidently intensified by tazemetostat in BRAF V600E-mutant cells. In conclusion, tazemetostat combined with MAPKi enhances differentiation of PTC cells harbouring BRAF V600E through synergistically decreasing global trimethylation of H3K27, representing a novel differentiation strategy.
32040259/Respiratory chain signalling is essential for adaptive remodelling following cardiac ischaemia Abstract Cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury has been attributed to stress signals arising from an impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which include redox imbalance, metabolic stalling and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The alternative oxidase (AOX) is a respiratory enzyme, absent in mammals, that accepts electrons from a reduced quinone pool to reduce oxygen to water, thereby restoring electron flux when impaired and, in the process, blunting ROS production. Hence, AOX represents a natural rescue mechanism from respiratory stress. This study aimed to determine how respiratory restoration through xenotopically expressed AOX affects the re-perfused post-ischaemic mouse heart. As expected, AOX supports ETC function and attenuates the ROS load in post-anoxic heart mitochondria. However, post-ischaemic cardiac remodelling over 3 and 9 weeks was not improved. AOX blunted transcript levels of factors known to be up-regulated upon I/R such as the atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp) whilst expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-apoptotic transcripts were increased. Ex vivo analysis revealed contractile failure at nine but not 3 weeks after ischaemia whilst label-free quantitative proteomics identified an increase in proteins promoting adverse extracellular matrix remodelling. Together, this indicates an essential role for ETC-derived signals during cardiac adaptive remodelling and identified ROS as a possible effector.
32027774/Mechanism of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase inhibiting cardiac allograft rejection in mice Abstract Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated regulation of tryptophan metabolism plays an important role in immune tolerance in transplantation, but it has not been elucidated which mechanism specifically induces the occurrence of immune tolerance. Our study revealed that IDO exerts immunosuppressive effects through two pathways in mouse heart transplantation, 'tryptophan depletion' and 'tryptophan metabolite accumulation'. The synergism between IDO+DC and TC (tryptophan catabolic products) has stronger inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte proliferation and mouse heart transplant rejection than the two intervention factors alone, and significantly prolong the survival time of donor-derived transplanted skin. This work demonstrates that the combination of IDO+DC and TC can induce immune tolerance to a greater extent, and reduce the rejection of transplanted organs.
32068946/Pingyangmycin inhibits glycosaminoglycan sulphation in both cancer cells and tumour tissues Abstract Pingyangmycin is a clinically used anticancer drug and induces lung fibrosis in certain cancer patients. We previously reported that the negatively charged cell surface glycosaminoglycans are involved in the cellular uptake of the positively charged pingyangmycin. However, it is unknown if pingyangmycin affects glycosaminoglycan structures. Seven cell lines and a Lewis lung carcinoma-injected C57BL/6 mouse model were used to understand the cytotoxicity of pingyangmycin and its effect on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Stable isotope labelling coupled with LC/MS method was used to quantify glycosaminoglycan disaccharide compositions from pingyangmycin-treated and untreated cell and tumour samples. Pingyangmycin reduced both chondroitin sulphate and heparan sulphate sulphation in cancer cells and in tumours. The effect was persistent at different pingyangmycin concentrations and at different exposure times. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of pingyangmycin was decreased in the presence of soluble glycosaminoglycans, in the glycosaminoglycan-deficient cell line CHO745, and in the presence of chlorate. A flow cytometry-based cell surface FGF/FGFR/glycosaminoglycan binding assay also showed that pingyangmycin changed cell surface glycosaminoglycan structures. Changes in the structures of glycosaminoglycans may be related to fibrosis induced by pingyangmycin in certain cancer patients.
32243061/Hsa_circ_0079662 induces the resistance mechanism of the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin through the TNF-alpha pathway in human colon cancer Abstract The aim of the study was to research the biological functions of circRNA (hsa_circ_0079662) and its underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer. Drug-resistant cell lines (HT29-LOHP, HCT116-LOHP, HCT8-LOHP) were separately dealt with oxaliplatin concentration gradient (0.1-10 mumol/L). Real-time PCR, Western blotting, dual-luciferase assay, miRNA pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation and ELASA were performed to explore the mechanism of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. The results showed that the expression of hsa_circ_0079662 was increased in drug-resistant cell lines by RT-PCR. The expression of HOXA9, TRIP6, Vcam-1, VEGFC, MMP3, MMP9 and MMP14 was higher by Western blotting. Interaction between HOXA9 and TRIP6 in CO-IP detection. Additionally, the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 were also found. In conclusion, hsa_circ_0079662, as a ceRNA binding with hsa-mir-324-5p, can regulate target gene HOXA9 and induced the mechanism of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin resistance in CRC through the TNF-alpha pathway in human colon cancer.
32191396/Use of Tregs as a cell-based therapy via CD39 for benign prostate hyperplasia with inflammation Abstract Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) occurs most commonly among older men, often accompanied by chronic tissue inflammation. Although its aetiology remains unclear, autoimmune dysregulation may contribute to BPH. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent autoimmune responses and maintain immune homeostasis. In this study, we aimed to investigate Tregs frequency, phenotype, and function in BPH patients and to evaluate adoptive transfer Tregs for immunotherapy in mice with BPH via CD39. Prostate specimens and peripheral blood from BPH patients were used to investigate Treg subsets, phenotype and Treg-associated cytokine production. Sorted CD39+/- Tregs from healthy mice were adoptively transferred into mice before or after testosterone propionate administration. The Tregs percentage in peripheral blood from BPH patients was attenuated, exhibiting low Foxp3 and CD39 expression with low levels of serum IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-beta. Immunohistochemistry revealed Foxp3+ cells were significantly diminished in BPH prostate with severe inflammatory. Although the Tregs subset was comprised of more effector/memory Tregs, CD39 was still down-regulated on effector/memory Tregs in BPH patients. Before or after testosterone propionate administration, no alterations of BPH symptoms were observed due to CD39- Tregs in mice, however, CD39+Tregs existed more potency than Tregs to regulate prostatic hyperplasia and inhibit inflammation by decreasing IL-1beta and PSA secretion, and increasing IL-10 and TGF-beta secretion. Furthermore, adoptive transfer with functional Tregs not only improved prostate hyperplasia but also regulated muscle cell proliferation in bladder. Adoptive transfer with Tregs may provide a novel method for the prevention and treatment of BPH clinically.
32198976/Long non-coding RNA-H19 stimulates osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via the microRNA-149/SDF-1 axis Abstract Bone defects resulting from non-union fractures or tumour resections are common clinical problems. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to play vital roles in stem cell differentiation. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of lncRNA-H19 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs). Following the establishment of an osteogenic differentiation model in rats, the expression of H19, microRNA-149 (miR-149) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) was measured by RT-qPCR. Thereafter, BMMSCs were isolated from rats and treated with a series of mimic, inhibitor or siRNA. SDF-1 expression, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OCN) content were detected. The mineralized and calcified nodules were assessed by alizarin red S and Von Kossa staining. BMMSC surface markers were detected by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of ALP, OCN, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osterix (OSX) proteins. Lastly, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation were applied to verify the relationship of H19, miR-149 and SDF-1. Overexpressed H19 and SDF-1 and poorly expressed miR-149 were found in rats with osteogenic differentiation. H19 increased SDF-1 expression by binding to miR-149. H19 enhanced ALP activity, OCN content, calcium deposit and ALP, OCN, RUNX2 and OSX protein expression of BMMSCS by up-regulating SDF-1 via binding to miR-149. Taken together, up-regulated H19 could promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs by increasing SDF-1 via miR-149.
32212312/Isopropyl-phloroglucinol-DHA protects outer retinal cells against lethal dose of all-trans-retinal Abstract All-trans-retinal (atRAL) is a highly reactive carbonyl specie, known for its reactivity on cellular phosphatidylethanolamine in photoreceptor. It is generated by photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal chromophore linked to opsin by the Schiff's base reaction. In ABCA4-associated autosomal recessive Stargardt macular dystrophy, atRAL results in carbonyl and oxidative stress, which leads to bisretinoid A2E, accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This A2E-accumulation presents as lipofuscin fluorescent pigment, and its photooxidation causes subsequent damage. Here we describe protection against a lethal dose of atRAL in both photoreceptors and RPE in primary cultures by a lipidic polyphenol derivative, an isopropyl-phloroglucinol linked to DHA, referred to as IP-DHA. Next, we addressed the cellular and molecular defence mechanisms in commonly used human ARPE-19 cells. We determined that both polyunsaturated fatty acid and isopropyl substituents bond to phloroglucinol are essential to confer the highest protection. IP-DHA responds rapidly against the toxicity of atRAL and its protective effect persists. This healthy effect of IP-DHA applies to the mitochondrial respiration. IP-DHA also rescues RPE cells subjected to the toxic effects of A2E after blue light exposure. Together, our findings suggest that the beneficial role of IP-DHA in retinal cells involves both anti-carbonyl and anti-oxidative capacities.
32227589/FGF21 induces autophagy-mediated cholesterol efflux to inhibit atherogenesis via RACK1 up-regulation Abstract Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) acts as an anti-atherosclerotic agent. However, the specific mechanisms governing this regulatory activity are unclear. Autophagy is a highly conserved cell stress response which regulates atherosclerosis (AS) by reducing lipid droplet degradation in foam cells. We sought to assess whether FGF21 could inhibit AS by regulating cholesterol metabolism in foam cells via autophagy and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without FGF21 and FGF21 + 3-Methyladenine (3MA) for 12 weeks. Our results showed that FGF21 inhibited AS in HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice, which was reversed by 3MA treatment. Moreover, FGF21 increased plaque RACK1 and autophagy-related protein (LC3 and beclin-1) expression in ApoE-/- mice, thus preventing AS. However, these proteins were inhibited by LV-RACK1 shRNA injection. Foam cell development is a crucial determinant of AS, and cholesterol efflux from foam cells represents an important defensive measure of AS. In this study, foam cells were treated with FGF21 for 24 hours after a pre-treatment with 3MA, ATG5 siRNA or RACK1 siRNA. Our results indicated that FGF21-induced autophagy promoted cholesterol efflux to reduce cholesterol accumulation in foam cells by up-regulating RACK1 expression. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation results showed that RACK1 was able to activate AMPK and interact with ATG5. Taken together, our results indicated that FGF21 induces autophagy to promote cholesterol efflux and reduce cholesterol accumulation in foam cells through RACK1-mediated AMPK activation and ATG5 interaction. These results provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of FGF21 in the treatment of AS.
32266795/Enhanced thioredoxin, glutathione and Nrf2 antioxidant systems by safflower extract and aceglutamide attenuate cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury Abstract A large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aggravate cerebral damage after ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R). Glutathione (GSH), thioredoxin (Trx) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) represent three major antioxidant systems and play vital roles in affecting each other in eliminating ROS. Identification of drugs targeting triple antioxidant systems simultaneously is vital for inhibiting oxidative damage after cerebral I/R. This study investigated the protective effect of safflower extract and aceglutamide (SAAG) against cerebral I/R injury through modulating multiple antioxidant systems of GSH, Trx and Nrf2 and identified each role of its component acegluatminde (AG) and safflower extract (SA) on these systems. Safflower extract and aceglutamide and its two components decreased neurological deficit scores, infarction rate, apoptosis and oxidative damage after cerebral I/R while enhanced cell viability, decreased reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide level in H2O2-induced PC12 cell model. Importantly, compared to its two components, SAAG demonstrated more effective enhancement of GSH, Nrf2 and Trx systems and a better protection against cerebral I/R injury. The enhanced antioxidant systems prevented ASK1 activation and suppressed subsequent p38 and JNK cascade-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of Trx and Nrf2 systems by auranofin and ML385 abolished SAAG-mediated protection, respectively. Thus, enhanced triple systems by SAAG played a better protective role than those by SA or AG via inhibition of ASK1 cascades. This research provided evidence for the necessity of combination drugs from the perspective of multiple antioxidant systems. Furthermore, it also offers references for the study of combination drugs and inspires novel treatments for ischaemic stroke.
32185887/Guaiacol suppresses osteoclastogenesis by blocking interactions of RANK with TRAF6 and C-Src and inhibiting NF-kappaB, MAPK and AKT pathways Abstract Angelica sinensis (AS; Dang Gui), a traditional Chinese herb, has for centuries been used for the treatment of bone diseases, including osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. However, the effective ingredient and underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identified guaiacol as the active component of AS by two-dimensional cell membrane chromatography/C18 column/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2D CMC/C18 column/TOFMS). Guaiacol suppressed osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function in bone marrow monocytes (BMMCs) and RAW264.7 cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that guaiacol blocked RANK-TRAF6 association and RANK-C-Src association. Moreover, guaiacol prevented phosphorylation of p65, p50, IkappaB (NF-kappaB pathway), ERK, JNK, c-fos, p38 (MAPK pathway) and Akt (AKT pathway), and reduced the expression levels of Cathepsin K, CTR, MMP-9 and TRAP. Guaiacol also suppressed the expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1(NFATc1) and the RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillation. In vivo, it ameliorated ovariectomy-induced bone loss by suppressing excessive osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that guaiacol inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by blocking the interactions of RANK with TRAF6 and C-Src, and by suppressing the NF-kappaB, MAPK and AKT signalling pathways. Therefore, this compound shows therapeutic potential for osteoclastogenesis-related bone diseases, including postmenopausal osteoporosis.
32297701/Arctiin attenuates high glucose-induced human retinal capillary endothelial cell proliferation by regulating ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K/Akt/VEGF pathway in vitro Abstract Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most prominent microvascular complications of diabetes, which remains the leading cause of legal blindness in the world. Arctiin, a bioactive compound from Arctium lappa L., has been reported to have antidiabetic activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of arctiin on a human retinal capillary endothelial cell (HRCEC) line and how arctiin inhibits cell proliferation in high glucose (HG)-induced HRCECs. Results showed that arctiin decreased HG-induced HRCECs proliferation in a dose-dependent manner by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Tube formation assay and immunofluorescence staining indicated that arctiin abrogated tube formation induced by HG-induced HRCECs in a dose-dependent manner via down-regulation of VEGF expression. Mechanistic study indicated that perturbation of the ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway plays a vital role in the arctiin-mediated anti-proliferative effect. Furthermore, pre-incubation of HRCECs with Y-27632 attenuated arctiin-induced cell cycle arrest, cell proliferation and tube formation inhibition. Y-27632 also reversed the activation of PTEN, the inactivation/dephosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and down-regulation of VEGF. Taken together, the results demonstrated that arctiin inhibits the proliferation of HG-induced HRCECs through the activation of ROCK1 and PTEN and inactivation of PI3K and Akt, resulting in down-regulation of VEGF, which inhibits endothelial cell proliferation.
32237051/SENP3 in monocytes/macrophages up-regulates tissue factor and mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by enhancing JNK phosphorylation Abstract The mechanisms underlying coagulation abnormalities in sepsis and septic acute lung injury remain unclear. Tissue factor (TF) initiates coagulation; its production can be regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS); and monocytes/macrophages produce pathological TF during sepsis. The SUMO2/3 protease SENP3 is redox-sensitive, and SENP3 accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages is ROS-dependent. To explore whether SENP3 contributes to LPS-activated coagulation, we used mice with Senp3 conditional knockout (cKO) in myeloid cells. In the model of LPS-induced sepsis, SENP3 cKO mice exhibited less severe acute lung injury than SENP3 fl/fl mice. SENP3 cKO mice exhibited decreased TF expression in monocytes and alveolar macrophages, with consequently compromised coagulation in their blood and lungs. In vitro results showed that ROS-induced SENP3 accumulation contributed to LPS-induced TF expression, which was reduced by JNK inhibitor SP600125. Furthermore, mice injected with LPS following SP600125 (75 mg/kg) treatment showed decreased monocytes/macrophages TF production and alleviated coagulation activation, with less severe lung injury and higher survival rates. Collectively, the results suggest that SENP3 mediates LPS-induced coagulation activation by up-regulating monocyte/macrophage TF production in a JNK-dependent manner. This work provides new insights into ROS regulation of LPS-activated coagulation and reveals a link between SUMOylation and coagulation.
32285621/Calcitriol enhances Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells via regulating VDR/PTPN2/p-STAT3 pathway Abstract There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency is the risk factor for multiple diseases, such as immune disorder, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D with beneficial effects on anti-cancer by binding vitamin D receptor (VDR). The primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of Calcitriol on papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and explore the possible mechanism. We found nuclear VDR expression in PTC samples was negatively correlated with STAT3 hyperphosphorylation that indicated worse PTC clinicopathologic characteristics. Calcitriol treatment up-regulated VDR and protein tyrosine phosphatase N 2 (PTPN2) expression, down-regulated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3) phosphorylation and thereby facilitating chemotherapy drug Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in PTC cell lines. However, the apoptosis-promoting effect of Calcitriol and Doxorubicin co-treatment was abrogated by STAT3 hyperphosphorylation, indicating suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation was essential for combined treatment of Calcitriol and Doxorubicin in PTC. Together, these results suggested that Calcitriol reinforced the sensitivity of PTC cells to Doxorubicin by regulating VDR/PTPN2/p-STAT3 signalling pathway.
32285603/ML264 inhibits osteosarcoma growth and metastasis via inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 and WNT/beta-catenin signalling pathways Abstract Osteosarcoma, the most common bone malignancy, has a high morbidity rate and poor prognosis. Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a key transcriptional regulator of cellular proliferation whose overexpression is observed in osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS, 143B, MG63 and SAOS2). ML264, a small-molecule inhibitor of KLF5, exerts antiproliferative effects in colorectal cancer; however, its function in osteosarcoma remains unknown. Here, we explored the possible antitumour effects of ML264 on 143B and U2OS cell lines and murine tumour xenograft model. ML264 suppressed proliferation and clonogenic ability of osteosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, ML264 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, with no influence on apoptosis, and inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of osteosarcoma cells, as demonstrated by wound-healing and Transwell assays. Exposure to ML264 reduced the mRNA and protein levels of molecules associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype, including N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP13. Inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation and Wnt signalling was also observed. In the murine model of osteosarcoma, tumour growth was efficiently suppressed following a 10-day treatment with ML264. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the potential value of ML264 as a novel anticancer drug for osteosarcoma.
32243691/Melatonin ameliorates renal fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation and renal fibrosis through miR-21-5p regulation Abstract Fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT) is widely recognized as the major pathological feature of renal fibrosis. Although melatonin has exerted antifibrogenic activity in many diseases, its role in renal FMT remains unclear. In the present study, the aim was to explore the effect of melatonin on renal FMT and the underlying mechanisms. We established the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 stimulated rat renal fibroblast cells (NRK-49F) model in vitro and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice model in vivo. We assessed levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), col1a1 and fibronectin, STAT3 and AP-1, as well as miR-21-5p and its target genes (Spry1, PTEN, Smurf2 and PDCD4). We found that melatonin reduced the expression of alpha-SMA, col1a1 and fibronectin, as well as the formation of alpha-SMA filament in TGF-beta1-treated NRK-49F cells. Meanwhile, melatonin inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, down-regulated miR-21-5p expression, and up-regulated Spry1 and PTEN expression. Moreover, miR-21-5p mimics partially antagonized the anti-fibrotic effect of melatonin. For animal experiments, the results revealed that melatonin remarkably ameliorated UUO-induced renal fibrosis, attenuated the expression of miR-21-5p and pro-fibrotic proteins and elevated Spry1 and PTEN expression. Nevertheless, agomir of miR-21-5p blocked the renoprotective effect of melatonin in UUO mice. These results indicated that melatonin could alleviate TGF-beta1-induced renal FMT and UUO-induced renal fibrosis through down-regulation of miR-21-5p. Regulation of miR-21-5p/PTEN and/or miR-21-5p/Spry1 signal might be involved in the anti-fibrotic effect of melatonin in the kidneys of UUO mice.
32297702/Ischaemic post-conditioning in rats: Responder and non-responder differ in transcriptome of mitochondrial proteins Abstract Ischaemic post-conditioning (IPoC) is a clinical applicable procedure to reduce reperfusion injury. Non-responsiveness to IPoC possibly caused by co-morbidities limits its clinical attractiveness. We analysed differences in the expression of mitochondrial proteins between IPoC responder (IPoC-R) and non-responder (IPoC-NR). Eighty rats were randomly grouped to sham, ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R), IPoC or ischaemic pre-conditioning (IPC, as positive cardioprotective intervention) in vivo. Infarct sizes were quantified by plasma troponin I levels 60 minutes after reperfusion. After 7 days, rats were sacrificed and left ventricular tissue was taken for post hoc analysis. The transcriptome was analysed by qRT-PCR and small RNA sequencing. Key findings were verified by immunoblots. I/R increased plasma troponin I levels compared to Sham. IPC reduced troponin I compared to I/R, whereas IPoC produced either excellent protection (IPoC-R) or no protection (IPoC-NR). Twenty-one miRs were up-regulated by I/R and modified by IPoC. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that IPoC-R differed from other groups by reduced expression of arginase-2 and bax, whereas the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 was induced in IPC and IPoC-R. IPoC-R and IPoC-NR synergistically increased the expression of non-mitochondrial proteins like VEGF and SERCA2a independent of the infarct size. Cardiac function was more closely linked to differences in mitochondrial proteins than on regulation of calcium-handling proteins. In conclusion, healthy rats could not always be protected by IPoC. IPoC-NR displayed an incomplete responsiveness which is reflected by different changes in the mitochondrial transcriptome compared to IPoC-R. This study underlines the importance of mitochondrial proteins for successful long-term outcome.
32248643/Novel regulation of miR-34a-5p and HOTAIR by the combination of berberine and gefitinib  leading to inhibition of EMT in human lung cancer Novel regulation of miR-34a-5p and HOTAIR by the combination of berberine and gefinitib leading to inhibition of EMT in human lung cancer Abstract HOTAIR is an important carcinogenic lncRNA and involves in tumorigenesis, and invasion. MiR-34a-5p functions as a tumour suppressor. However, the underlying mechanism of HOTAIR regulation especially in association with miR-34a-5p in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been explored. Herein, we performed series of in vitro experiments, including viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis and in vivo xenograft model, and identified that HOTAIR was remarkably elevated in NSCLC cells. Enforced HOTAIR expression promoted migration and invasion, while depleted HOTAIR diminished the ability of migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. We also observed that miR-34a-5p was dramatically inhibited in NSCLC cells and the binding correlation between HOTAIR and miR-34a-5p was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. We also showed that induction of miR-34a-5p and reduction of HOTAIR, and the interaction between miR-34a-5p and HOTAIR resulted in the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as illustrated by induction of key epithelial markers E-cadherin expression, reduction of vimentin and EMT-inducing transcription factor snail. Excessive expression of snail resisted miR-34a-5p-inhibited cell growth. Snail binds to E-cadherin promoter and regulates E-cadherin expression. There was a synergy in combination of berberine and gefinitib in this process. Similar findings were also observed in a tumour xenograft model. Collectively, this is the first report demonstrating reciprocal interaction of miR-34a-5p- and HOTAIR-mediated regulation of snail resulting in inhibition of EMT process by the combination of berberine and gefitinib suggesting that regulation of miR-34a-5p- and HOTAIR-mediated inhibition of EMT may provide novel treatment paradigms for lung cancer.
32270599/LINC00963 targeting miR-128-3p promotes acute kidney injury process by activating JAK2/STAT1 pathway Abstract The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in kidney diseases has been gradually discovered in recent years. LINC00963, as an lncRNA, was found to be involved in chronic renal failure. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of LINC00963 engaged in acute kidney injury (AKI) were still unclear. In this study, we established rat AKI models by ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R) treatment. Urea and creatinine levels were determined, and histological features of kidney tissues were examined following HE staining. CCK8 assay was chosen to assess the viability of hypoxia-induced HK-2 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were performed to verify the target relationship between LINC00963 and microRNA. The mRNA and protein levels were assayed by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Annexin V-FITC/PI and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate apoptosis. LINC00963 was highly expressed in the cell and rat models, and miR-128-3p was predicted and then verified as a target gene of LINC00963. Knockdown of LINC00963 reduced acute renal injury both in vitro and in vivo. LINC00963 activated the JAK2/STAT1 pathway to aggravate renal I/R injury. LINC00963 could target miR-128-3p to reduce G1 arrest and apoptosis through JAK2/STAT1 pathway to promote the progression of AKI. 
32279420/HOTAIR/miR-125 axis-mediated Hexokinase 2 expression promotes chemoresistance in human glioblastoma Abstract Drug resistance is one of the major obstacles in glioblastoma (GBM) treatments using temozolomide (TMZ) based conventional chemotherapy. Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ.
32163676/Preliminary results of targeted prostate-specific membrane antigen imaging in evaluating the efficacy of a novel hormone agent in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer Abstract To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging to make response assessment regarding novel hormone treatment and to predict the outcomes for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. This retrospective study enrolled 68 mCRPC patients who had daily received a novel hormone agent named abiraterone. Tc-99m PSMA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was performed at the baseline (SPECT/CT1) and after 3-6 months of treatment (SPECT/CT2). The treatment response was determined by visual analysis based on molecular imaging PSMA (miPSMA) scores framework and was compared with conventional biochemical analysis. We chose either the hottest lesion (target A) or five of the hottest lesions (target B) to calculate the tumor/background ratio (TBR) and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and compared their performances in predicting progression-free survival (PFS). Changes in PSMA expression between SPECT/CT1 and SPECT/CT2 were well associated with the results of the visual analysis. The TBR and the SUVmax of both targets were significantly associated with the baseline serum PSA level (P < .0001). The biochemical and radiological responses were concordant in 56 of the 68 patients (P < .001). The median PFS of the nonresponse group patients was significantly shorter than that of the patients in the response group (6.8 vs 12.1 months, P = .012). For predicting PFS, most of the indexes tested were significant on SPECT/CT2, with %DeltaTBR being the most significant prognostic factor. Our preliminary results suggest that molecular imaging-targeted PSMA is of great value for treatment response assessment and clinical outcome prediction in mCRPC patients with long-term abiraterone treatment. We found it very accurate to evaluate the effect of abiraterone on prostate cancer using PSMA molecular imaging. PSMA imaging is expected to replace traditional imaging in prostate diagnosis and treatment 
32162845/ASCT2 overexpression is associated with poor survival of OSCC patients and ASCT2 knockdown inhibited growth of glutamine-addicted OSCC cells Abstract Background Alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2), a major glutamine transporter, is essential for cell growth and tumor development in a variety of cancers. However, the clinicopathological significance and pathological role of ASCT2 in OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) lesions remain unclear. Methods Sections from 89 OSCC patients and 10 paracancerous tissue controls were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect the expression of ASCT2, glutaminase, and Ki-67. Survival analysis was carried out to determine the predictive value of ASCT2 expression using the log-rank test. Moreover, the critical role of ASCT2 in tumor growth was determined by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), Western Blotting (WB), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Glutathione (GSH) detection were applied to explore the molecular mechanism of ASCT2 involvement in tumor development. Results In OSCC lesions, ASCT2 expression was significantly increased and associated with cell proliferation index (Ki-67) and GLS expression. Moreover, survival analysis showed that OSCC patients with high ASCT2 expression had lower overall survival (P = 0.0365). In OSCC cell lines, the high level of ASCT2 was inherent and related to the glutamine addiction of tumor cells. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments revealed that targeted silencing of ASCT2 can effectively inhibit OSCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, targeting ASCT2 knockdown reduced glutamine uptake and intracellular GSH levels, which contribute to the accumulation of ROS and induce apoptosis in OSCC cells. Conclusion ASCT2 is a significant factor for predicting overall survival in patients with OSCC, and targeting ASCT2 to inhibit glutamine metabolism may be a promising strategy for OSCC treatment. This study identifies ASCT2 is a significant prognostic factor for predicting overall survival of OSCC patients. Targeted ASCT2 knockdown effectively inhibits cancer growth in vitro and in vivo via inhibiting GSH synthesis and inducing ROS-mediated apoptosis. Targeting ASCT2 may provide a novel strategy for OSCC treatment.  
32187452/The impact of dose modification and temporary interruption of ibrutinib on outcomes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients in routine clinical practice Abstract To study the impact of dose modification and temporary interruption of ibrutinib in routine clinical practice, we conducted a retrospective study of consecutive CLL patients treated with ibrutinib outside the context of a clinical trial at Mayo Clinic, (Rochester, MN) from 11/2013 to 12/2017. Of 209 patients, 131 (74%) had unmutated IGHV, 38 (20%) had TP53 disruption, and 47 (22%) were previously untreated. A total of 87/209 (42%) patients started reduced dose ibrutinib (<420 mg daily; n = 43, physician preference; n = 33, concomitant medications; and n = 11, other). During 281 person-years of treatment, 91/209 patients had temporary dose interruption (54%, nonhematologic toxicity; 29%, surgical procedures; 10%, hematologic toxicity; and 7%, other). After a median follow-up of 24 months, the estimated median event-free survival (EFS) was 36 months, and median overall survival (OS) was not reached. On multivariable analyses, temporary ibrutinib interruption (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.37, P = .006) and TP53 disruption at ibrutinib initiation (HR: 1.81, P = .048) were associated with shorter EFS, whereas only TP53 disruption (HR: 2.38, P = .015) was associated with shorter OS. Initial ibrutinib dose and dose modification during therapy did not appear to impact EFS or OS. These findings illustrate the challenges associated with continuous oral therapy with ibrutinib in patients with CLL. In this single-institution study of CLL patients receiving ibrutinib therapy outside the context of a clinical trial, approximately 40% patients initiated ibrutinib at a reduced dose (<420 mg daily, primarily due to concomitant medications that may increase ibrutinib toxicity and physician prescribing patterns). In addition, approximately 50% patients subsequently undergo a dose modification and/or a dose interruption after initiation of ibrutinib therapy. Finally, although ibrutinib starting dose and dose modifications did not impact event free survival and overall survival, temporary dose interruptions during therapy were associated with shorter event free survival and shorter overall survival. 
31578830/Sodium butyrate-activated TRAF6-TXNIP pathway affects A549 cells proliferation and migration Abstract TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) promotes the development of human lung cancer through bridging RAS and NF-kB pathways; on the other hand, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) suppresses the growth of tumors. However, the crosstalk between TRAF6 and TXNIP in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently unclear. Here, we found that TXNIP expression induced by sodium butyrate (NaBu) was TRAF6-dependent. Moreover, TXNIP interacted with TRAF6 via its PPxY motif. Polyubiquitylation analysis with wild-type or mutant (Cysteine70 to Alanine) of TRAF6 further showed TRAF6 ubiquitylated TXNIP. NaBu reinforced the interaction of TRAF6/TXNIP as well as TXNIP' polyubiquitylation. Moreover, treated with NaBu, the A549 cells with TRAF6/TXNIP double knockdown showed an enhanced protein expression of E-cadherin comparing to cells with single gene or negative knockdown. The experimental results of transwell and nude mice xenograft showed that knocking down both TRAF6 and TXNIP in A549 cells affected its migration and proliferation compared to that of single knockdown or negative control cells. On the other hand, TXNIP localization was different depending on the cell types and fused-tag (eg, FLAG or GFP). Our results revealed TRAF6 regulated the expression and polyubiquitylation of TXNIP in a NaBu-dependent manner, alleviating tumorigenesis of TRAF6. TRAF6 interacted and uibquitylated TXNIP. Sodium butyrate promoted the interaction of TRAF6 and TXNIP. Traf6 mediated sodium butyrate induced-TXNIP expression. 
32168428/A patient-derived xenograft and a cell line derived from it form a useful preclinical model for small bowel adenocarcinoma Abstract Basic and clinical studies on small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) are limited due to the rare nature of this cancer. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model from the tumor tissue of an advanced SBA patient with liver and peritoneal metastasis, and a cell line from the PDX. In the PDX model, compared to the control group, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment resulted in statistically significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI), while oxaliplatin (OHP) and irinotecan had no significant inhibitory effects. In combination with 5-FU, OHP showed the highest rate of TGI. The IC50 for OHP was significantly lower than those for paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and trifluorothymidine in the PDX-derived cell line when compared to in HT29, a colon cancer cell line. Genetic analysis of the patient tumor, PDX tumor, and the cell line demonstrated consistency in the microsatellite status and mutations in TP53, APC, HRAS, CSF1R, FGFR3, FLT3, PDGFRA, and RET genes. However, the PDX tumor alone had additional mutations, indicating that the PDX-derived cell line may support the unstable genetic status of the PDX. Our findings confirmed the effectiveness of the combination of OHP and 5-FU, which is a common treatment for advanced SBA and advanced colorectal cancer, in a preclinical model. This preclinical model of SBA can help in further understanding the biology of SBA. Our data indicated that 5-FU was the key drug for treatment and OHP alone had the additional effect in combination with 5-FU. 
32168429/Crizotinib vs platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with different ROS1 fusion variants Abstract Background  ROS1 gene fusion represents a specific subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Crizotinib is recommended for ROS1-positive NSCLC due to its favorable outcome in published clinical trials. However, due to the low incidence of ROS1-positive NSCLC, there is limited information on real-world clinical outcomes in patients treated with either crizotinib or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Methods Outcomes were recorded in 102 patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC who were treated at four Chinese hospitals between April, 2010 and June, 2019. Results Of the 102 patients followed, 71.6% were females, 81.4% were non-smokers, and 98.0% had adenocarcinoma. First-line treatment with crizotinib achieved a significantly longer median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy (14.9 months vs 8.5 months, respectively; P < .001). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified 61 patients who had ROS1 fusion variants, including CD74 (n = 33) and non-CD74 (n = 28) variants. In patients harboring CD74 fusion variants, the median PFS with first-line crizotinib treatment was significantly longer than in those harboring non-CD74 fusion variants (20.1 months vs 12.0 months, respectively; P = .046). However, in patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in PFS between the CD74 and non-CD74 variant groups (8.6 months vs 4.3 months, respectively; P = .115). Overall survival (OS) was not reached. Conclusions First-line therapy with crizotinib is more beneficial than platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC with different ROS1 fusion variants. Patients harboring CD74 fusion variants appear to respond better to crizotinib. For first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement, crizotinib is more beneficial than platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients harboring ROS1 CD74 fusion variants who are treated with first-line crizotinib therapy have better PFS than those harboring non-CD74 fusion variants. With first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, patients in both the CD74 and non-CD74 fusion variant groups demonstrated a short PFS with no significant difference observed. 
32181596/Efficacy and safety of anlotinib, a multikinase angiogenesis inhibitor, in combination with epirubicin in preclinical models of soft tissue sarcoma Abstract Background Anlotinib is a novel, orally administered, multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It functions by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling pathways. In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus epirubicin in a sarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDX) model. Methods We firstly established a PDX model using fresh tumor tissues that were surgically removed from a patient diagnosed with malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Thirty-six PDX models were divided into six groups and treated with anlotinib alone (low-dose, 1.5 or high-dose, 3.0 mg/kg/day, oral gavage), or with anlotinib plus epirubicin (3.0 mg/kg/once weekly, i.p.) when the tumors grew to 150-200 mm3. After 5 weeks of treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were measured by weight and processed for IHC and H&E staining. IHC staining was performed to detect CD31, EGFR, MVD, and Ki-67 on paraffin sections. H&E stainings were performed to examine the microcosmic changes that occurred in the tumor tissues and myocardium, respectively. Results After 5 weeks, treatment with anlotinib or epirubicin alone significantly inhibited tumor growth in the sarcoma PDX model compared with the vehicle control. Tumor volume in the high-dose anlotinib group was significantly smaller than the low-dose anlotinib group (P < .001). Combined high-dose anlotinib and epirubicin treatment resulted in the most pronounced tumor inhibition. In the groups treated with the anlotinib-containing regimen, the expression levels of CD31, EGFR, MVD, and Ki-67 were significantly low. The weight in each group had no statistical differences; the same applied to the hepatic function, cardiac function, and toxicity. Conclusions High-dose anlotinib combined with epirubicin was an effective and safe therapy for STS. Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare and diverse group of solid tumors with poor survival. For the first time, we showed that anlotinib, a multikinase angiogenesis inhibitor, combined with epirubicin was an effective and safe therapy in a sarcoma patient-derived xenografts model, which suggested combined therapy drug as a promising therapeutic strategy for STS patients. 
32212232/Prostate cancer in Pennsylvania: The role of older age at diagnosis, aggressiveness, and environmental risk factors on treatment and mortality using data from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry Abstract Background To assess: (a) cancer treatment in prostate cancer survivors (PCS) by age at diagnosis (ADx) and prostate cancer (PC) aggressiveness; (b) potential impact on PC mortality; and (c) these results in the context of environmental/behavioral risk factors on PCS in Pennsylvania. Methods Prostate cancer survivors ages >=40 years were identified from the 2004-2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR). Demographic/clinical descriptors and PC treatment were extracted from PCR. Prostate cancer aggressiveness was defined by clinical/pathologic Gleason score and tumor stage. Logistic and Cox regression analyses tested associations between treatment received and PC-specific mortality. County-level data from the Pennsylvania BRFSS were used to estimate cancer-related behavioral risk factors (eg, smoking, physical inactivity, fruit/vegetable consumption [FV], alcohol use) and used as covariates. Results There were 90 694 PCS ages 40-105 years (mean age = 66.19 years, SD = 9.25) included. Most were non-Hispanic white men (83%). Prostate cancer survivors >=75 years were least likely to receive any treatment but men ages 65-74 were more likely to receive combined therapies (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.28, 1.69) vs PCS ages 40-54 years, controlling for covariates. Prostate cancer survivors 55-75+ with aggressive PC who received any treatment vs no definitive treatment had significantly reduced mortality. Men from counties with high obesity and smoking rates were significantly less likely to receive any treatment than men living in counties with lower rates of these risk factors. Prostate cancer survivors who lived in counties with high rates of physical inactivity and had high rates of sufficient FV consumption were slightly more likely to receive cancer treatment vs no definitive treatment compared to men who lived in counties with high rates of physical activity and lower FV consumption. Conclusions We observed a general age-related decline in receipt of treatment. Prostate cancer survivors ages >=75 years were significantly less likely to get any cancer treatment compared to younger PCS. However, most men with more aggressive disease who received any treatment had greatly reduced PC mortality, regardless of age. Considering environmental/behavioral risk factors may attenuate PC risk and inform treatment options. We analyzed prostate cancer registry data for >90 000 men ages 40-105 to understand age-related associations with disease aggressiveness, treatment and potential role of environmental/behavioral risk factors in understanding likelihood of treatment recommendations and impact on mortality. Men older than 75 years were more likely to have aggressive disease but less likely to receive any treatment. The oldest men also had the greatest survival benefits from any treatment. We also provide insight on whether where you live impacts your treatment and ultimate survival. 
32167664/First-line crizotinib versus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy in patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer Abstract Objectives Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved crizotinib for advanced ROS1-rearranged (ROS1+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients due to a single-arm study PROFILE 1001. However, there is no direct comparison between crizotinib and platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy. Materials and methods Clinical data of advanced ROS1+NSCLC patients treated with first-line crizotinib or platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy between August 2010 and December 2017 were analyzed. Results Seventy-seven patients were eligible, including 30 (39.0%) in the crizotinib group and 47 (61.0%) in the platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy group. The median follow-up was 28.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.2-39.0). The objective response rate (ORR) of crizotinib (86.7%, 95% CI: 73.3-96.7) was higher than that of platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy (44.7%, 95% CI: 29.8-57.4, P < .001). The disease control rate (DCR) was 96.7% (95% CI: 90.0-100) in the crizotinib group and 85.1% (95% CI: 74.5-95.7) in the chemotherapy group (P = .140). Significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) was observed in the patients treated with crizotinib (18.4 months, 95% CI: 6.4-30.3) versus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy (8.6 months, 95% CI: 6.9-10.3, P < .001). Overall survival (OS) was also compared between the two groups and no significant difference was seen (Not reach vs 28.4 months [95% CI: 20.7-36.0], P = .176). Notably, a total of 37 patients have treatment crossover after the failure of first-line treatment. Among those patients, difference in OS was not statistically significant between seven patients who have given first-line crizotinib (38.6 months, 95% CI: 0-81.0) and 30 patients who have given platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy initially (32.8 months, 95% CI: 11.9-53.8, P = .805). Conclusions Our results suggested that first-line crizotinib had higher ORR and longer PFS than platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy in patients with advanced ROS1+NSCLC, but the differences were not observed for OS. This is the first study to compare crizotinib with chemotherapy in ROS1+NSCLC. Crizotinib was superior to platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy as an initial treatment. 
31568670/Incidence of benign and malignant peri-implant fluid collections and masses on magnetic resonance imaging in women with silicone implants Abstract Background To assess the incidence of benign and malignant peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women with silicone implants who are being screened for silent implant rupture. Methods The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study and waived informed consent. Women who underwent silicone implant oncoplastic and/or cosmetic surgery and postoperative implant-protocol MRI from 2000 to 2014 were included. Peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses were measured volumetrically. A benign peri-implant fluid collection and/or mass was pathologically proven or defined as showing 2 years of imaging and/or clinical stability. A malignant peri-implant fluid collection was pathologically proven. Incidence of peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated on a per-patient level using proportions and exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fisher's exact test was used in the analysis to test statistical significance pre-defined as P-value < 0.05. Results A total of 1070 women with silicone implants were included (mean age, 50.7 years; range, 40.4-53.8). Median time between reconstructive surgery and first MRI was 88.9 months (range, 0.8-1363.3). Eighteen women (1.7%) had a peri-implant fluid collection and/or mass: 15/18 (83.3%) had adequate follow-up; and only 1/15 was malignant implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, with a PPV of 6.7% (95% CI: 0.003-0.0005). The median peri-implant fluid collection size was 89 mL (range, 18-450 mL). Conclusion Peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses identified at silicone implant protocol breast MR imaging are rarely seen 24 months after reconstructive surgery. Image-guided fine-needle aspiration with flow cytometry may be warranted to evaluate for implant-associated lymphoma. Peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses on implant protocol breast MRI are rarely seen 24 months after surgery. Image-guided fine needle aspiration of delayed peri-implant fluid collection may be considered, as there is a significant association with breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. 
32167655/Circ-PGAM1 promotes malignant progression of epithelial ovarian cancer through regulation of the miR-542-3p/CDC5L/PEAK1 pathway Abstract Background Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common ovarian malignant cancer. Circular RNA is a type of endogenous noncoding RNA and is considered as a novel regulatory molecule in the development and progression of tumors. This study investigated the expression and functions of a circular RNA, circular-phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (circ-PGAM1), in EOC tissues and cells. Methods The expression of circ-PGAM1 and miR-542-3p in EOC was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry and western blot were performed to confirm the localization and expression of cell division cycle 5-like (CDC5L) and pseudopodium enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1) in EOC tissues. Cell lines (CAOV3 and OVCAR3) overexpressing or silencingcirc-PGAM1 and miR-542-3p were established to explore the functions of circ-PGAM1 and miR-542-3p in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to study the interactions between circ-PGAM1 and miR-542-3p and between miR-542-3p and CDC5L. CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry were used to study the effect of circ-PGAM1 and miR-542-3p on cell biological behaviors including proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. The interaction between CDC5L and the PEAK1 gene promoter was confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Results Circ-PGAM1 was upregulated in EOC tissues, whereas linear PGAM1 was not deregulated in EOC tissues. Silencing of circ-PAGM1 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells and promoted cell apoptosis. MiR-542-3p was downregulated in EOC tissues, and miR-542-3p overexpression inhibited malignant progression of ovarian cancer cells. Circ-PGAM1 directly interacted with miR-542-3p, with mutual negative feedback between them. CDC5L was a direct target of miR-542-3p and played an oncogenic role in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the CDC5L protein binds directly to the PEAK1 promoter to promote its transcription. PEAK1 overexpression activated ERK1/2 and JAK2 signaling pathways and promoted malignant biological behaviors of ovarian cancer cells. Circ-PAGM1 silencing combined with miR-542-3p overexpression played the greatest anticancer role in vivo. Conclusion The circ-PGAM1/miR-542-3p/CDC5L/PEAK1 pathway played an important role in the progression of ovarian cancer and might be a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. Our study confirmed that circ-PGAM1 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells through down-regulation of miR-542-3p. MiR-542-3p played a tumor-suppressing role through down-regulation of CDC5L. CDC5L was a downstream target of miR-542-3p, and PEAK1 is a downstream target of CDC5L. 
32170852/Identification of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes and associated pathways in endometrial cancer using integrated bioinformatic analysis Abstract Endometrial cancer (EC) is a fatal female reproductive tumor. Bioinformatic tools are increasingly developed to screen out molecular targets related to EC. In this study, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE17025 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40032 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). "limma" package and Venn diagram tool were used to identify hub genes. FunRich was used for functional analysis. Retrieval of Interacting Genes Database (STRING) was used to analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex. Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GEPIA, immunohistochemistry staining, and ROC curve analysis were carried out for validation. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to predict the risk score. Compound muscle action potential (CMap) was used to find potential drugs. GSEA was also done. We retrieved seven oncogenes which were upregulated and hypomethylated and 12 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) which were downregulated and hypermethylated. The upregulated and hypomethylated genes were strikingly enriched in term "immune response" while the downregulated and hypermethylated genes were mainly focused on term "aromatic compound catabolic process." TCGA and GEPIA were used to screen out EDNRB, CDO1, NDN, PLCD1, ROR2, ESPL1, PRAME, and PTTG1. Among them, ESPL1 and ROR2 were identified by Cox regression analysis and were used to construct prognostic risk model. The result showed that ESPL1 was a negative independent prognostic factor. Cmap identified aminoglutethimide, luteolin, sulfadimethoxine, and maprotiline had correlation with EC. GSEA results showed that "hedgehog signaling pathway" was enriched. This research inferred potential aberrantly methylated DEGs and dysregulated pathways may participate in EC development and firstly reported eight hub genes, including EDNRB, CDO1, NDN, PLCD1, ROR2, ESPL1, PRAME, and PTTG1 that could be used to predict EC prognosis. Aminoglutethimide and luteolin may be used to fight against EC.

32448163/Pirfenidone alleviates pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and in vivo through regulating Wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways Background Pirfenidone (PFD) is effective for pulmonary fibrosis (PF), but its action mechanism has not been fully explained. This study explored the signaling pathways involved in anti-fibrosis role of PFD, thus laying a foundation for clinical application. Methods Pulmonary fibrosis mice models were constructed by bleomycin (BLM), and TGF-beta1 was used to treat human fetal lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Then, PFD was added into treated mice and cells alone or in combination with beta-catenin vector. The pathological changes, inflammatory factors levels, and Collagen I levels in mice lung tissues were assessed, as well as the activity of HLFs was measured. Levels of indices related to extracellular matrix, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), Wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways were determined in tissues or cells. Results After treatment with BLM, the inflammatory reaction and extracellular matrix deposition in mice lung tissues were serious, which were alleviated by PFD and aggravated by the addition of beta-catenin. In HLFs, PFD reduced the activity of HLFs induced by TGF-beta1, inhibited levels of vimentin and N-cadherin and promoted levels of E-cadherin, whereas beta-catenin produced the opposite effects to PFD. In both tissues and cells, Wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways were activated, which could be suppressed by PFD. Conclusions PFD alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and in vivo through regulating Wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways, which might further improve the action mechanism of anti-fibrosis effect of PFD.
32460706/Pinocembrin mitigates depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress through ameliorating neuroinflammation and apoptosis Background The majority of patients with chronic fatigue have a risk of comorbidity with depression. Pinocembrin (PB) is a kind of flavonoid molecule isolated from honey and propolis and has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer function. The purpose of the current study was to determine the possible function of PB on treatment of depression. Methods A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model was established to mimic the depressive-like behaviors in vivo. The depressive-like behaviors of CUMS mice were measured by sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity or superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected by commercial kit. The inflammatory factor including interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta were examined. Results We found that PB alleviated the decreasing of sucrose preference and body weight. CUMS mice significantly increased the immobility time but decreased latency to abandon in FST, increased the immobility time in TST, and reduced crossing score and rearing score in OFT, whereas these changes were reversed by PB treatment. More importantly, PB decreased the concentration of ROS and MDA, but increased the SOD activity, suggesting that it could protected against oxidative stress in CUMS mice. Interestingly, PB inhibited cell apoptosis and regulated inflammatory factors expression in hippocampus of CUMS mice. Moreover, PB activated Nrf2/HO-1 signal pathway but inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-kB. Conclusions In conclusion, PB mitigated CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors through ameliorating neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Trial registration Not Applicable.
32503411/The protective effects of the beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist BRL37344 against liver steatosis and inflammation in a rat model of high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Background Our objective was to investigate the efficacy of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) agonist BRL37344 for the prevention of liver steatosis and inflammation associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods Four groups were established: a control group (given a standard diet), a high-fat diet (HFD) group, an HFD + beta3-AR agonist (beta3-AGO) group, and an HFD + beta3-AR antagonist (beta3-ANT) group. All rats were fed for 12 weeks. The beta3-AR agonist BRL37344 and the antagonist L748337 were administered for the last 4 weeks with Alzet micro-osmotic pumps. The rat body weights (g) were measured at the end of the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks. At the end of the 12th week, the liver weights were measured. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were analyzed with a Hitachi automatic analyzer. The lipid levels of the triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) were also measured. An oil red O kit was used to detect lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes. Steatosis, ballooning degeneration and inflammation were histopathologically determined. The protein and mRNA expression levels of beta3-AR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (mCPT-1), and fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 were measured by western blot analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. Results After treatment with the beta3-AR agonist BRL37344 for 4 weeks, the levels of ALT, AST, TGs, TC, LDL-C and FFAs were decreased in the NAFLD model group compared with the HFD group. Body and liver weights, liver index values and lipid droplet accumulation were lower in the HFD + beta3-AGO group than in the HFD group. Decreased NAFLD activity scores (NASs) also showed that liver steatosis and inflammation were ameliorated after treatment with BRL37344. Moreover, the beta3-AR antagonist L748337 reversed these effects. Additionally, the protein and gene expression levels of beta3-AR, PPAR-alpha, and mCPT-1 were increased in the HFD + beta3-AGO group, whereas those of PPAR-gamma and FAT/CD36 were decreased. Conclusion The beta3-AR agonist BRL37344 is beneficial for reducing liver fat accumulation and for ameliorating liver steatosis and inflammation in NAFLD. These effects may be associated with PPARs/mCPT-1 and FAT/CD36.
32517686/Ethyl pyruvate protects against sepsis-associated encephalopathy through inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome Background With the advance of antibiotics and life support therapy, the mortality of sepsis has been decreasing in recent years. However, the incidence of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a common complication of sepsis, is still high. There are few effective therapies to treat clinical SAE. We previously found that ethyl pyruvate (EP), a metabolite derivative, is able to effectively inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Administration of ethyl pyruvate protects mice against polymicrobial sepsis in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. The aim of present study is to investigate if ethyl pyruvate is able to attenuate SAE. Methods After CLP, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally or intrathecally injected with saline or ethyl pyruvate using the sham-operated mice as control. New Object Recognition (NOR) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) were conducted to determine the cognitive function. Brain pathology was assessed via immunohistochemistry. To investigate the mechanisms by which ethyl pyruvate prevent SAE, the activation of NLRP3 in the hippocampus and the microglia were determined using western blotting, and cognitive function, microglia activation, and neurogenesis were assessed using WT, Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice in the sublethal CLP model. In addition, Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice treated with saline or ethyl pyruvate were subjected to CLP. Results Ethyl pyruvate treatment significantly attenuated CLP-induced cognitive decline, microglia activation, and impaired neurogenesis. In addition, EP significantly decreased the NLRP3 level in the hippocampus of the CLP mice, and inhibited the cleavage of IL-1beta induced by NLRP3 inflammsome in microglia. NLRP3 and ASC deficiency demonstrated similar protective effects against SAE. Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice significantly improved cognitive function and brain pathology when compared with WT mice in the CLP models. Moreover, ethyl pyruvate did not have additional effects against SAE in Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice. Conclusion The results demonstrated that ethyl pyruvate confers protection against SAE through inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.
32600307/The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuates hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury by alleviating the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways and the circulation Background Oxygen therapy, using supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia), is routinely administered to patients who require respiratory support including mechanical ventilation (MV). However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia results in acute lung injury (ALI) and accumulation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in the airways. We previously showed that airway HMGB1 mediates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a mouse model of ALI. Cholinergic signaling through the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) attenuates several inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether 3-(2,4 dimethoxy-benzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride, GTS-21, an alpha7nAChR partial agonist, inhibits hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 accumulation in the airways and circulation, and consequently attenuates inflammatory lung injury. Methods Mice were exposed to hyperoxia (>=99% O2) for 3 days and treated concurrently with GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) or the control vehicle, saline. Results The systemic administration of GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly decreased levels of HMGB1 in the airways and the serum. Moreover, GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury, as indicated by the decreased total protein content in the airways, reduced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils into the lung tissue and airways, and improved lung injury histopathology. Conclusions Our results indicate that GTS-21 can attenuate hyperoxia-induced ALI by inhibiting extracellular HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses. This suggests that the alpha7nAChR represents a potential pharmacological target for the treatment regimen of oxidative inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving oxygen therapy.
32640976/WRN inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of human lensepithelial cells through ATM/p53 signaling pathway and its expression is downregulated by DNA methylation Background Apoptosis and oxidative stress are the main etiology of age related cataract (ARC). This article aims to investigate the role of WRN in lens epithelial cells (LECs). Methods We estimated the methylation level of WRN in anterior lens capsule tissues of ARC patients. SRA01/04 (LECs) cells were treated with H2O2 or combined with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) or chloroquine. CCK8 and flow cytometry were performed to explore proliferation and apoptosis. The content of ROS was detected by fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The gene and protein expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR or western blot. Results WRN was down-regulated and the methylation level of WRN was increased in the anterior lens capsule tissues. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR enhanced proliferation and repressed apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells. 5-Aza-CdR enhanced WRN expression. WRN knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells, which was rescued by 5-Aza-CdR. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR repressed ATM/p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, chloroquine inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells by activating ATM/p53 signaling pathway. The influence conferred by chloroquine was abolished by WRN overexpression. Conclusion Our study reveals that DNA methylation mediated WRN inhibits apoptosis and oxidative stress of human LECs through ATM/p53 signaling pathway.
32698821/Electroacupuncture alleviates polycystic ovary syndrome-like symptoms through improving insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress via enhancing autophagy in rats Background Electroacupuncture (EA), a treatment derived from traditional Chinese medicine, can effectively improve hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), however, its underlying mechanisms remain obscure. This study aimed to investigate whether EA could mitigate PCOS-like symptoms in rats by regulating autophagy. Methods A rat model of PCOS-like symptoms was established by subcutaneous injection with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and then EA treatment at acupoints (ST29 and SP6) was carried out for 5 weeks. To inhibit autophagy in rats, intraperitoneal injection with 0.5 mg/kg 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor) was performed at 30 min before each EA treatment. Results EA intervention alleviated PCOS-like symptoms in rats, which was partly counteracted by the combination with 3-MA. Moreover, DHEA-exposure-induced deficient autophagy in skeletal muscle was improved by EA treatment. EA-mediated improvements in insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in PCOS-like rats were counteracted by 3-MA pretreatment. Mechanically, EA attenuated autophagy deficiency-mediated insulin resistance in PCOS-like rats via inactivating mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway. Conclusions Taken together, our findings indicate that EA treatment ameliorates insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress through enhancing autophagy in a PCOS-like rat model. Our study provides novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the treatment of EA in PCOS, which offers more theoretic foundation for its clinical application.
32588513/Dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32kDa (DARPP-32), protein phosphatase-1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 expression in ovarian cancer Abstract Dopamine and cyclic-AMP activated phosphoprotein Mr32kDa (DARPP-32) is a central signalling protein in neurotransmission. Following DARPP-32 phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), DARPP-32 becomes a potent protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor. DARPP-32 can itself inhibit PKA following DARPP-32 phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Increasing evidence indicates a role for DARPP-32 and its associated signalling pathways in cancer; however, its role in ovarian cancer remains unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, expression of DARPP-32, PP1 and Cdk5 was determined in a large cohort of primary tumours from ovarian cancer patients (n = 428, 445 and 434 respectively) to evaluate associations between clinical outcome and clinicopathological criteria. Low cytoplasmic and nuclear DARPP-32 expression was associated with shorter patient overall survival and progression-free survival (P = .001, .001, .004 and .037 respectively). Low nuclear and cytoplasmic DARPP-32 expression remained significantly associated with overall survival in multivariate Cox regression (P = .045, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.734, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.542-0.993 and P = .001, HR = 0.494, 95% CI = 0.325-0.749, respectively). High cytoplasmic and nuclear PP1 expression was associated with shorter patient overall survival and high cytoplasmic PP1 expression with shorter progression-free survival (P = .005, .033, and .037, respectively). High Cdk5 expression was associated with shorter progression-free survival (P = .006). These data suggest a role for DARPP-32 and associated signalling kinases as prognostic markers with clinical utility in ovarian cancer.
32639111/PD-1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a biomarker for different stages of primary gouty arthritis Abstract There is currently a lack of biomarkers to assist the diagnosis and prediction of primary gouty arthritis (PG). Therefore, we evaluated the clinical value of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PG. This study included 36 patients with acute phase PG (APPG), 48 with non-acute phase PG (NAPPG), 42 with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AH) and 79 normal controls (NCs). PD-1 mRNA expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR. PD-1 mRNA expression was statistically analysed by ANOVA or t tests, while correlations between PD-1 mRNA and clinical variables were assessed using Pearson correlation tests. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of PD-1 in different PG stages. PD-1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in patients with APPG than that in NAPPG, AH and NCs (P < 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed that PD-1 mRNA levels correlated negatively with T-score (r = -0.209, P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that serum uric acid (SUA), PD-1 mRNA and both combined displayed higher diagnostic value in patients with PG, NAPPG and APPG compared to that in NCs and patients with non-PG arthritis (NPG). Moreover, ROC curve analysis showed that SUA and PD-1 mRNA had good diagnostic value in APPG, with the greatest diagnostic power when combined. PD-1 mRNA could be a clinical auxiliary diagnostic biomarker for APPG, and the combined use of PD-1 mRNA and SUA is better than that of SUA alone.
32627970/Calpain-2 plays a pivotal role in the inhibitory effects of propofol against TNF-alpha-induced autophagy in mouse hippocampal neurons Abstract Calpains are calcium-dependent proteases and play critical roles in neuronal autophagy induced by inflammation. Propofol has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects in neurons. We aimed to identify whether and how propofol-modulated calpain activity and neuron autophagy in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Mouse hippocampal neurons were pre-treated with propofol and exposed to TNF-alpha. Autophagy was evaluated by fluorescent autophagy assay and by measuring LC3I and LC3II expression. Intracellular calcium concentration was measured by fluorescent assay. Calpain activation was measured by calpain activity assay. The protein expression of intracellular signalling molecules was detected by Western blot analysis. Compared with untreated control neurons, 40 ng/mL TNF-alpha treatment for 2 hours induced neuron autophagy, which was attenuated by 25 mumol/L propofol. TNF-alpha induced intracellular calcium accumulation, the phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK II) and calpain-2, calpain activation and lysosomal cathepsin B release as well as tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) truncation. These effects were alleviated by propofol, calcium chelator, CAMK II inhibitor, calpain-2 inhibitor, calpain-2 siRNA transfection and N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Propofol, via NMDA receptor, inhibited TNF-alpha-mediated hippocampal neuron autophagy. The mechanism may involve calcium and calcium-dependent signalling pathway, especially CAMK II and calpain-2.
32648659/MD1 deletion exaggerates cardiomyocyte autophagy induced by heart failure with preserved ejection fraction through ROS/MAPK signalling pathway Abstract In our previous studies, we reported that myeloid differentiation protein 1 (MD1) serves as a negative regulator in several cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of MD1 in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and the underlying mechanisms of its action remain unclear. Eight-week-old MD1-knockout (MD1-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice served as models of HFpEF induced by uninephrectomy, continuous saline or d-aldosterone infusion and a 1.0% sodium chloride treatment in drinking water for 4 weeks to investigate the effect of MD1 on HFpEF in vivo. H9C2 cells were treated with aldosterone to evaluate the role of MD1 KO in vitro. MD1 expression was down-regulated in the HFpEF mice; HFpEF significantly increased the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoted autophagy; and in the MD1-KO mice, the HFpEF-induced intracellular ROS and autophagy effects were significantly exacerbated. Moreover, MD1 loss activated the p38-MAPK pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Aldosterone-mediated cardiomyocyte autophagy was significantly inhibited in cells pre-treated with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or p38 inhibitor SB203580. Furthermore, inhibition with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) offset the aggravating effect of aldosterone-induced autophagy in the MD1-KO mice and cells both in vivo and in vitro. Our results validate a critical role of MD1 in the pathogenesis of HFpEF. MD1 deletion exaggerates cardiomyocyte autophagy in HFpEF via the activation of the ROS-mediated MAPK signalling pathway.
32618105/Dioscin elicits anti-tumour immunity by inhibiting macrophage M2 polarization via JNK and STAT3 pathways in lung cancer Abstract Tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) is an important component in tumour microenvironment. Generally, TAM exhibits the function of M2-like macrophage, which was closely related to angiogenesis and tumour progression. Dioscin, a natural steroidal saponin, has shown its powerful anti-tumour activity recently. However, the mechanism of dioscin involved in immune regulation is still obscure. Here, we observed dioscin induced macrophage M2-to-M1 phenotype transition in vitro and inhibited IL-10 secretion. Meanwhile, the phagocytosis of macrophages was enhanced. In subcutaneous lung tumour models, dioscin inhibited the augmentation of M2 macrophage populations. Furthermore, dioscin down-regulated STAT3 and JNK signalling pathways in macrophages in vitro. In BMDMs, activating JNK and inhibiting STAT3 induce macrophages to M1 polarization while inhibiting JNK and activating STAT3 to M2 polarization. Additionally, condition mediums from dioscin-pre-treated macrophages inhibited the migration of 3LL cells and the tube-formation capacity of HUVECs. What's more, dioscin-mediated macrophage polarization inhibited the in vivo metastasis of 3LL cells. In conclusion, dioscin may act as a new anti-tumour agent by inhibiting TAMs via JNK and STAT3 pathways in lung cancer.
32657027/Ellagic acid protects dopamine neurons from rotenone-induced neurotoxicity via activation of Nrf2 signalling Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent central nervous system (CNS) degenerative disease. Oxidative stress is one of key contributors to PD. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is considered to be a master regulator of many genes involved in anti-oxidant stress to attenuate cell death. Therefore, activation of Nrf2 signalling provides an effective avenue to treat PD. Ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenolic contained in fruits and nuts, possesses amounts of pharmacological activities, such as anti-oxidant stress and anti-inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed EA could be used as a neuroprotective agent in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, mice subcutaneous injection of rotenone (ROT)-induced DA neuronal damage was performed to investigate EA-mediated neuroprotection. In addition, adult Nrf2 knockout mice and different cell cultures including MN9D-enciched, MN9D-BV-2 and MN9D-C6 cell co-cultures were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms. Results demonstrated EA conferred neuroprotection against ROT-induced DA neurotoxicity. Activation of Nrf2 signalling was involved in EA-mediated DA neuroprotection, as evidenced by the following observations. First, EA activated Nrf2 signalling in ROT-induced DA neuronal damage. Second, EA generated neuroprotection with the presence of astroglia and silence of Nrf2 in astroglia abolished EA-mediated neuroprotection. Third, EA failed to produce DA neuroprotection in Nrf2 knockout mice. In conclusion, this study identified EA protected against DA neuronal loss via an Nrf2-dependent manner.
32633891/Positive feedback in Cav-1-ROS signalling in PSCs mediates metabolic coupling between PSCs and tumour cells Abstract Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the principal structural component of caveolae, and its dysregulation occurs in cancer. However, the role of Cav-1 in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) tumorigenesis and metabolism is largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) Cav-1 on PDAC metabolism and aggression. We found that Cav-1 is expressed at low levels in PDAC stroma and that the loss of stromal Cav-1 is associated with poor survival. In PSCs, knockdown of Cav-1 promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while ROS production further reduced the expression of Cav-1. Positive feedback occurs in Cav-1-ROS signalling in PSCs, which promotes PDAC growth and induces stroma-tumour metabolic coupling in PDAC. In PSCs, positive feedback in Cav-1-ROS signalling induced a shift in energy metabolism to glycolysis, with up-regulated expression of glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase 2 (HK-2), 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKP) and pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2)) and transporter (Glut1) expression and down-regulated expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymes (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1)). These events resulted in high levels of glycolysis products such as lactate, which was secreted by up-regulated monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) in PSCs. Simultaneously, PDAC cells took up these glycolysis products (lactate) through up-regulated MCT1 to undergo OXPHOS, with down-regulated expression of glycolytic enzymes (HK-2, PFKP and PKM2) and up-regulated expression of OXPHOS enzymes (TOMM20 and NQO1). Interrupting the metabolic coupling between the stroma and tumour cells may be an effective method for tumour therapy.
32618109/Comprehensive analysis of autophagy-related prognostic genes in breast cancer Abstract Accumulating evidence revealed that autophagy played vital roles in breast cancer (BC) progression. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) and develop a ARG-based model to evaluate 5-year overall survival (OS) in BC patients. We acquired ARG expression profiling in a large BC cohort (N = 1007) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The correlation between ARGs and OS was confirmed by the LASSO and Cox regression analyses. A predictive model was established based on independent prognostic variables. Thus, time-dependent receiver operating curve (ROC), calibration plot, decision curve and subgroup analysis were conducted to determine the predictive performance of ARG-based model. Four ARGs (ATG4A, IFNG, NRG1 and SERPINA1) were identified using the LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analyses. A ARG-based model was constructed based on the four ARGs and two clinicopathological risk factors (age and TNM stage), dividing patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The 5-year OS of patients in the low-risk group was higher than that in the high-risk group (P < 0.0001). Time-dependent ROC at 5 years indicated that the four ARG-based tool had better prognostic accuracy than TNM stage in the training cohort (AUC: 0.731 vs 0.640, P < 0.01) and validation cohort (AUC: 0.804 vs 0.671, P < 0.01). The mutation frequencies of the four ARGs (ATG4A, IFNG, NRG1 and SERPINA1) were 0.9%, 2.8%, 8% and 1.3%, respectively. We built and verified a novel four ARG-based nomogram, a credible approach to predict 5-year OS in BC, which can assist oncologists in determining effective therapeutic strategies.
32628813/PCSK9 inhibitor and atorvastatin reduce cardiac impairment in ovariectomized prediabetic rats via improved mitochondrial function and Ca2+ regulation Abstract Post-menopausal women have a higher risk of developing cardiometabolic dysfunction. Atorvastatin attenuates dyslipidaemia and cardiac dysfunction but it can have undesirable effects including increased risk of diabetes and myalgia. Currently, the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor efficiently reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels more effectively than atorvastatin. We have been suggested that PCSK9 inhibitor attenuated cardiometabolic impairment more effectively than atorvastatin in ovariectomized prediabetic rats. Female Wistar rats (n = 48) were fed a normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Then, HFD rats were assigned to a sham-operated (Sham) or ovariectomized (OVX) group. Six weeks after surgery, the OVX group was subdivided into 4 treatment groups: vehicle (HFOV), atorvastatin (HFOA) (40 mg/kg/day; s.c.), PCSK9 inhibitor (HFOP) (4 mg/kg/day; s.c.) and oestrogen (HFOE2) (50 microg/kg/day; s.c.) for an additional 3 weeks. Metabolic parameters, cardiac and mitochondrial function, and [Ca2+]i transients were evaluated. All HFD rats became obese-insulin resistant. HFS rats had significantly impaired left ventricular (LV) function, cardiac mitochondrial function and [Ca2+]i transient dysregulation. Oestrogen deprivation (HFOV) aggravated all of these impairments. Our findings indicated that the atorvastatin, PCSK9 inhibitor and oestrogen shared similar efficacy in the attenuation in cardiometabolic impairment in ovariectomized prediabetic rats.
32628811/Cell cycle exit during bortezomib-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells was mediated by Xbp1s-upregulated p21Cip1 and p27Kip1  Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into a variety of cell types. Bortezomib, the first approved proteasome inhibitor used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), has been shown to induce osteoblast differentiation, making it beneficial for myeloma bone disease. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of bortezomib on the cell cycle during osteogenic differentiation. We confirmed that low doses of bortezomib can induce MSCs towards osteogenic differentiation, but high doses are toxic. In the course of bortezomib-induced osteogenic differentiation, we observed cell cycle exit characterized by G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest with a significant reduction in cell proliferation. Additionally, we found that the cell cycle exit was tightly related to the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Notably, we further demonstrated that the up-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 is transcriptionally dependent on the bortezomib-activated ER stress signalling branch Ire1alpha/Xbp1s. Taken together, these findings reveal an intracellular pathway that integrates proteasome inhibition, osteogenic differentiation and the cell cycle through activation of the ER stress signalling branch Ire1alpha/Xbp1s.
32639107/Effect of icosapent ethyl on susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias in postinfarcted rat hearts: Role of GPR120-mediated connexin43 phosphorylation Abstract The omega-3 fatty acids exert as an antioxidant via the G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120). Icosapent ethyl, a purified eicosapentaenoic acid, showed a marked reduction in sudden cardiac death. Connexin43 is sensitive to redox status. We assessed whether icosapent ethyl attenuates fatal arrhythmias after myocardial infarction, a status of high oxidative stress, through increased connexin43 expression and whether the GPR120 signalling is involved in the protection. Male Wistar rats after ligating coronary artery were assigned to either vehicle or icosapent ethyl for 4 weeks. The postinfarction period was associated with increased oxidative-nitrosative stress. In concert, myocardial connexin43 levels revealed a significant decrease in vehicle-treated infarcted rats compared with sham. These changes of oxidative-nitrosative stress and connexin43 levels were blunted after icosapent ethyl administration. Provocative arrhythmias in the infarcted rats treated with icosapent ethyl were significantly improved than vehicle. Icosapent ethyl significantly increased GPR120 compared to vehicle after infarction. The effects of icosapent ethyl on superoxide and connexin43 were similar to GPR120 agonist GW9508. Besides, the effects of icosapent ethyl on oxidative-nitrosative stress and connexin43 phosphorylation were abolished by administering AH-7614, an inhibitor of GPR120. SIN-1 abolished the Cx43 phosphorylation of icosapent ethyl without affecting GPR120 levels. Taken together, chronic use of icosapent ethyl after infarction is associated with up-regulation of connexin43 phosphorylation through a GPR120-dependent antioxidant pathway and thus plays a beneficial effect on arrhythmogenic response to programmed electrical stimulation.
32633463/Hydrogen sulphide ameliorating skeletal muscle atrophy in db/db mice via Muscle RING finger 1 S-sulfhydration Abstract Muscle atrophy occurs in many pathological states, including cancer, diabetes and sepsis, whose results primarily from accelerated protein degradation and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Expression of Muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was increased to induce the loss of muscle mass in diabetic condition. However, hydrogen sulphide (H2S) plays a crucial role in the variety of physiological functions, including antihypertension, antiproliferation and antioxidant. In this study, db/db mice and C2C12 myoblasts treated by high glucose and palmitate and oleate were chose as animal and cellular models. We explored how exogenous H2S attenuated the degradation of skeletal muscle via the modification of MuRF1 S-sulfhydration in db/db mice. Our results show cystathionine-r-lyase expression, and H2S level in skeletal muscle of db/db mice was reduced. Simultaneously, exogenous H2S could alleviate ROS production and reverse expression of ER stress protein markers. Exogenous H2S could decrease the ubiquitination level of MYOM1 and MYH4 in db/db mice. In addition, exogenous H2S reduced the interaction between MuRF1 with MYOM1 and MYH4 via MuRF1 S-sulfhydration. Based on these results, we establish that H2S prevented the degradation of skeletal muscle via MuRF1 S-sulfhydration at the site of Cys44 in db/db mice.
32661130/Water transport mediated by murine urea transporters: implications for urine concentration mechanisms ABSTRACT Urea transporters (UTs) facilitate urea diffusion across cell membranes and play an important role in the urinary concentration mechanisms in the kidney. Herein, we injected cRNAs encoding for c-Myc-tagged murine UT-B, UT-A2 or UT-A3 (versus water-injected control) in Lithobates oocytes and evaluated oocyte surface protein expression with biotinylation and immunoblotting, urea uptake using [14C] counts and water permeability (Pf) by video microscopy. Immunoblots of UT-injected oocyte membranes revealed bands with a molecular weight consistent with that of a UT monomer (34 kDa), and UT-injected oocytes displayed significantly increased and phloretin-sensitive urea uptake and Pf when compared to day-matched control oocytes. Subtracting the water-injected urea uptake or Pf values from those of UT-injected oocytes yielded UT-dependent values*. We demonstrate for the first time that UT-A2 and UT-A3 can transport water, and we confirm that UT-B is permeable to water. Moreover, the [14C] urea*/Pf* ratios fell in the sequence mUT-B>mUT-A2>mUT-A3, indicating that UTs can exhibit selectivity to urea and/or water. It is likely that specific kidney regions with high levels of UTs will exhibit increased urea and/or water permeabilities, directly influencing urine concentration. Furthermore, UT-mediated water transport activity must be considered when developing UT-inhibitors as novel diuretics. Summary: Renal urea transporters can transport both urea and water, which could have direct effects on renal function, especially the production of concentrated urine.
32709696/Comparative interactomics analysis reveals potential regulators of alpha6beta4 distribution in keratinocytes ABSTRACT The integrin alpha6beta4 and cytoskeletal adaptor plectin are essential components of type I and type II hemidesmosomes (HDs). We recently identified an alternative type II HD adhesion complex that also contains CD151 and the integrin alpha3beta1. Here, we have taken a BioID proximity labeling approach to define the proximity protein environment for alpha6beta4 in keratinocytes. We identified 37 proteins that interacted with both alpha6 and beta4, while 20 and 78 proteins specifically interacted with the alpha6 and beta4 subunits, respectively. Many of the proximity interactors of alpha6beta4 are components of focal adhesions (FAs) and the cortical microtubule stabilizing complex (CMSC). Though the close association of CMSCs with alpha6beta4 in HDs was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis, CMSCs have no role in the assembly of HDs. Analysis of the beta4 interactome in the presence or absence of CD151 revealed that they are strikingly similar; only 11 different interactors were identified. One of these was the integrin alpha3beta1, which interacted with alpha6beta4 more strongly in the presence of CD151 than in its absence. These findings indicate that CD151 does not significantly contribute to the interactome of alpha6beta4, but suggest a role of CD151 in linking alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 together in tetraspanin adhesion structures. Summary: Comparative interactomics analysis reveals close proximity of HDs, FAs and CMSCs, and a role of CD151 in linking alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 together in an alternative type II HD-like adhesion complex.
32694188/The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology ABSTRACT Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, beta-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and beta-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 microg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or beta-cell number and were mitigated by the micro-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on beta-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of beta-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 microg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of beta-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of beta-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote beta-cell development and enable the regeneration of beta-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes. Summary: Human mild contains bioactive peptides - beta-casomorphins (BCM) - that influence beta-cell biology. Specifically human BCM increased the insulin domain of expression in zebrafish embryos and did not interfere with beta-cell regeneration. This may have relevance for breastfeeding practices.
32847522/Effect of intrathecal lipophilic opioids on the incidence of shivering in women undergoing cesarean delivery after spinal anesthesia: a systematic review and bayesian network meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials Background Shivering is a common side effect in women having cesarean delivery (CD) under spinal anesthesia, which can be bothersome to the patient, and it can also interfere with perioperative monitoring. In several studies, the intrathecal (IT) addition of a lipophilic opioid to local anesthetics has been shown to decrease the incidence of shivering. Objective We performed this network meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of intrathecal lipophilic opioids in preventing the incidence of shivering in patients undergoing CD. Methods This review was planned according to the PRISMA for Network Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines. An English literature search of multiple electronic databases was conducted. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the incidence of shivering, with study groups receiving either IT fentanyl, sufentanil, or meperidine in women undergoing CD under spinal anesthesia. Quality of the studies was assessed using the modified Oxford scoring system. Using random-effects modeling, dichotomous data were extracted and summarized using odds ratio (OR) with a 95% credible interval (CrI). Statistical analysis was conducted using R studio version 1.0.153 - Inc. Results Twenty-one studies consisting of 1433 patients (Control group: 590 patients in twenty-one studies; Fentanyl group:199 patients in seven studies; Sufentanil group: 156 patients in five studies; Meperidine group: 488 patients in ten studies) met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review investigating the effect of intrathecal lipophilic opioids in preventing the incidence of shivering in women undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Methodological validity scores ranged from 3 to 7. The Bayesian mixed network estimate showed the incidence of shivering was significantly lower with IT fentanyl (pooled odds ratio (OR): 0.13; 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.04 to 0.35; P = 0.0004) and IT meperidine (OR: 0.12; 95% CrI: 0.05 to 0.29; P < 0.00001), but not with IT sufentanil (OR: 0.37; 95% CrI: 0.11 to 1.22; P = 0.23). The IT fentanyl group had a significantly lower incidence of intraoperative discomfort [Risk Ratio (RR): 0.19; 95% CI: 0.10-0.35; P < 0.00001], the IT sufentanil group had a significantly higher incidence of pruritus (RR: 6.18; 95% CI: 1.18-32.46; P = 0.03) The IT meperidine group had a significantly lower incidence of intraoperative discomfort (2.7% vs. 13.6%; RR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.09-0.55; P = 0.001), but there was a significant increase in nausea and vomiting (IT meperidine group vs. Control group: 42.7% vs. 19.4%; RR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.14-5.75; P = 0.02). Meta-regression analysis based on the opioid dose and quality of the study did not impact the final inference of our result. Conclusion IT fentanyl significantly decreased the incidence of shivering in women undergoing CD under spinal anesthesia without increasing maternal adverse events, confirming that routine use in this patient population is a good choice. IT sufentanil did not decrease the incidence of shivering. IT meperidine decreased the incidence and severity of shivering, but its use was also associated with significant nausea and vomiting.
32847512/Biodegradation of atrazine and ligninolytic enzyme production by basidiomycete strains Background Atrazine is one of the most widespread chlorinated herbicides, leaving large bulks in soils and groundwater. The biodegradation of atrazine by bacteria is well described, but many aspects of the fungal metabolism of this compound remain unclear. Thus, we investigated the toxicity and degradation of atrazine by 13 rainforest basidiomycete strains. Results In liquid medium, Pluteus cubensis SXS320, Gloelophyllum striatum MCA7, and Agaricales MCA17 removed 30, 37, and 38%, respectively, of initial 25 mg L- 1 of the herbicide within 20 days. Deficiency of nitrogen drove atrazine degradation by Pluteus cubensis SXS320; this strain removed 30% of atrazine within 20 days in a culture medium with 2.5 mM of N, raising three metabolites; in a medium with 25 mM of N, only 21% of initial atrazine were removed after 40 days, and two metabolites appeared in culture extracts. This is the first report of such different outcomes linked to nitrogen availability during the biodegradation of atrazine by basidiomycetes. The herbicide also induced synthesis and secretion of extracellular laccases by Datronia caperata MCA5, Pycnoporus sanguineus MCA16, and Polyporus tenuiculus MCA11. Laccase levels produced by of P. tenuiculus MCA11 were 13.3-fold superior in the contaminated medium than in control; the possible role of this enzyme on atrazine biodegradation was evaluated, considering the strong induction and the removal of 13.9% of the herbicide in vivo. Although 88% of initial laccase activity remained after 6 h, no evidence of in vitro degradation was observed, even though ABTS was present as mediator. Conclusions This study revealed a high potential for atrazine biodegradation among tropical basidiomycete strains. Further investigations, focusing on less explored ligninolytic enzymes and cell-bound mechanisms, could enlighten key aspects of the atrazine fungal metabolism and the role of the nitrogen in the process.
32843050/First case of Dolutegravir and Darunavir/r multi drug-resistant HIV-1 in Cameroon following exposure to Raltegravir: lessons and implications in the era of transition to Dolutegravir-based regimens Background Sub-Saharan African countries are transitioning to dolutegravir-based regimens, even for patients with extensive previous drug exposure, including first-generation integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTI) such as raltegravir. Such exposure might have implications on cross-resistance to dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapies (ART). Case presentation We report a 65 years old Cameroonian, previously exposed to raltegravir, and failing on third-line treatment with multi-drug resistance to darunavir/r and dolutegravir. Genotypic resistance testing (GRT) and viral tropism were performed during monitoring time points. The patient initiated ART in August 2007. At the time point of the first (29.04.2010), second (01.12.2017) and third (08.08.2019) GRT, prior ART exposure included 3TC, d4T, NVP and EFV; additionally TDF, DRV/r and RAL; and additionally ABC and DTG respectively. First GRT revealed mutations associated with resistance only to first-generation Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Second GRT revealed mutations associated with high-level resistance to all NRTIs, first generation NNRTIs, all ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), and all INSTI, while viral tropism (using geno2pheno) revealed a CCR5-tropic virus with a false positive rate (FPR) of 60.9% suggesting effectiveness of maraviroc (MRV). The third GRT showed high-level resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, all PI and all INSTI, with additional mutations (H221HY for NNRTI and S147G for INSTI), and a CCR5-tropic virus with a slightly reduced FPR (57.0%). Without any locally available active therapeutic option, the patient has been on a maintenance therapy with "DRV/r (600mg x 2/day)+TDF+3TC" and patient/family-centered adherence has been reinforced. Since the first viral load (VL) measurement in 2010, the patient has had 12 VL tests with the VL ranging from 4.97 Log to 6.44 Log copies/mL and the CD4 count never exceeded 200 cells/muL. Conclusions As African countries transition to dolutegravir-based regimens, prior raltegravir-exposure may prompt selection (and potential transmission) of dolutegravir-resistance, supporting case surveillance.
32854613/Effects of Desflurane and Sevoflurane anesthesia on regulatory T cells in patients undergoing living donor kidney transplantation: a randomized intervention trial Background Volatile anesthetic agents used during surgery have immunomodulatory effects which could affect postoperative outcomes. Recognizing that regulatory T cells (Tregs) plays crucial roles in transplant tolerance and high peripheral blood Tregs associated with stable kidney graft function, knowing which volatile anesthetic agents can induce peripheral blood Tregs increment would have clinical implications. This study aimed to compare effects of desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia on peripheral blood Tregs induction in patients undergoing living donor kidney transplantation. Methods A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in living donor kidney transplant recipients was conducted at a single center, tertiary-care, academic university hospital in Thailand during August 2015 - June 2017. Sixty-six patients were assessed for eligibility and 40 patients who fulfilled the study requirement were equally randomized and allocated to desflurane versus sevoflurane anesthesia during transplant surgery. The primary outcome included absolute changes of peripheral blood CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Tregs which measured by flow cytometry and expressed as the percentage of the total population of CD4+ T lymphocytes at pre-exposure (0-h) and post-exposure (2-h and 24-h) to anesthetic gas. P-value < 0.05 denoted statistical significance. Results Demographic data were comparable between groups. No statistical difference of peripheral blood Tregs between desflurane and sevoflurane groups observed at the baseline pre-exposure (3.6 +- 0.4% vs. 3.1 +- 0.4%; p = 0.371) and 2-h post-exposure (3.0 +- 0.3% vs. 3.5 +- 0.4%; p = 0.319). At 24-h post-exposure, peripheral blood Tregs was significantly higher in desflurane group (5.8 +- 0.5% vs. 4.1 +- 0.3%; p = 0.008). Within group analysis showed patients receiving desflurane, but not sevoflurane, had 2.7% increase in peripheral blood Treg over 24-h period (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study provides the clinical trial-based evidence that desflurane induced peripheral blood Tregs increment after 24-h exposure, which could be beneficial in the context of kidney transplantation. Mechanisms of action and clinical advantages of desflurane anesthesia based on Treg immunomodulation should be investigated in the future. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02559297.

32854634/3-Methylxanthine production through biodegradation of theobromine by Aspergillus sydowii PT-2 Background Methylxanthines, including caffeine, theobromine and theophylline, are natural and synthetic compounds in tea, which could be metabolized by certain kinds of bacteria and fungi. Previous studies confirmed that several microbial isolates from Pu-erh tea could degrade and convert caffeine and theophylline. We speculated that these candidate isolates also could degrade and convert theobromine through N-demethylation and oxidation. In this study, seven tea-derived fungal strains were inoculated into various theobromine agar medias and theobromine liquid mediums to assess their capacity in theobromine utilization. Related metabolites with theobromine degradation were detected by using HPLC in the liquid culture to investigate their potential application in the production of 3-methylxanthine. Results Based on theobromine utilization capacity, Aspergillus niger PT-1, Aspergillus sydowii PT-2, Aspergillus ustus PT-6 and Aspergillus tamarii PT-7 have demonstrated the potential for theobromine biodegradation. Particularly, A. sydowii PT-2 and A. tamarii PT-7 could degrade theobromine significantly (p < 0.05) in all given liquid mediums. 3,7-Dimethyluric acid, 3-methylxanthine, 7-methylxanthine, 3-methyluric acid, xanthine, and uric acid were detected in A. sydowii PT-2 and A. tamarii PT-7 culture, respectively, which confirmed the existence of N-demethylation and oxidation in theobromine catabolism. 3-Methylxanthine was common and main demethylated metabolite of theobromine in the liquid culture. 3-Methylxanthine in A. sydowii PT-2 culture showed a linear relation with initial theobromine concentrations that 177.12 +- 14.06 mg/L 3-methylxanthine was accumulated in TLM-S with 300 mg/L theobromine. Additionally, pH at 5 and metal ion of Fe2+ promoted 3-methylxanthine production significantly (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study is the first to confirm that A. sydowii PT-2 and A. tamarii PT-7 degrade theobromine through N-demethylation and oxidation, respectively. A. sydowii PT-2 showed the potential application in 3-methylxanthine production with theobromine as feedstock through the N-demethylation at N-7 position.
32859255/Prevalence of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use among inpatients in a tertiary hospital in Fiji: a point prevalence survey Background Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use (AMU) are important drivers of antimicrobial resistance, yet there is minimal data from the Pacific region. We sought to determine the point prevalence of HAIs and AMU at Fiji's largest hospital, the Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) in Suva. A secondary aim was to evaluate the performance of European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control (ECDC) HAI criteria in a resource-limited setting. Methods We conducted a point prevalence survey of HAIs and AMU at CWMH in October 2019. Survey methodology was adapted from the ECDC protocol. To evaluate the suitability of ECDC HAI criteria in our setting, we augmented the survey to identify patients with a clinician diagnosis of a HAI where diagnostic testing criteria were not met. We also assessed infection prevention and control (IPC) infrastructure on each ward. Results We surveyed 343 patients, with median (interquartile range) age 30 years (16-53), predominantly admitted under obstetrics/gynaecology (94, 27.4%) or paediatrics (83, 24.2%). Thirty patients had one or more HAIs, a point prevalence of 8.7% (95% CI 6.0% to 12.3%). The most common HAIs were surgical site infections (n = 13), skin and soft tissue infections (7) and neonatal clinical sepsis (6). Two additional patients were identified with physician-diagnosed HAIs that failed to meet ECDC criteria due to insufficient investigations. 206 (60.1%) patients were receiving at least one antimicrobial. Of the 325 antimicrobial prescriptions, the most common agents were ampicillin (58/325, 17.8%), cloxacillin (55/325, 16.9%) and metronidazole (53/325, 16.3%). Use of broad-spectrum agents such as piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 6) and meropenem (1) was low. The majority of prescriptions for surgical prophylaxis were for more than 1 day (45/76, 59.2%). Although the number of handwashing basins throughout the hospital exceeded World Health Organization recommendations, availability of alcohol-based handrub was limited and most concentrated within high-risk wards. Conclusions The prevalence of HAIs in Fiji was similar to neighbouring high-income countries, but may have been reduced by the high proportion of paediatric and obstetrics patients, or by lower rates of inpatient investigations. AMU was very high, with duration of surgical prophylaxis an important target for future antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.
32867678/Ertapenem and Faropenem against Mycobacterium tuberculosis: in vitro testing and comparison by macro and microdilution Background Interest in carbapenems has been rising in the last few years due to the emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis. Ertapenem (ETP), given once a day parenteral, and faropenem (FAR), oral, have a better administration profile than meropenem (MEM), imipenem (IPM) and doripenem (DOR). The addition of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) inhibits the hydrolysis by the carbapenemase present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro activity of ETP and FAR against susceptible and resistant clinical MTB strains by two widely use methodologies, the BACTEC960 MGIT and microdilution. Results 19 clinical isolates with different susceptibility profiles and H37Rv were included. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using two methods of different concentrations of ETP and FAR with and without AMC. MIC50 was 2 and 8 for FAR with and without AMC by both methods. MIC90 was > 16 and > 8 by microdilution and MGIT respectively and did not change after AMC addition. 18/20 samples were resistant to the highest concentration of ETP, with and without AMC. Half of the samples had some susceptibility to FAR; addition of AMC further reduced the MIC level in seven isolates. 10/20 isolates showed susceptibility to FAR and the addition of AMC further reduced the MIC in 7 isolates. However, most of the MICs were near the limit of effectiveness (8 mug/mL). Resistance to FAR was associated with resistance to MEM (p = 0.04) but not to resistance profiles of other drugs, including M/XDR status. Conclusions The lack of ETP activity may be associated with its degradation, independent of carbapenemase, during incubation. No susceptibility pattern to traditional drugs can predict susceptibility to FAR and susceptibility testing is not routinely available. PK/PD studies are needed as reaching the concentrations tested in these experiments may be challenging. This work highlighted some of the limitations of carbapenem use. More evidence is needed to clarify their true impact in TB treatment and outcome, considering the financial burden, complications and microbiota changes associated with their use.
32867798/TRPP2 and STIM1 form a microdomain to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry and blood vessel tone Background Polycystin-2 (TRPP2) is a Ca2+ permeable nonselective cationic channel essential for maintaining physiological function in live cells. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is an important Ca2+ sensor in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Both TRPP2 and STIM1 are expressed in endoplasmic reticular membrane and participate in Ca2+ signaling, suggesting a physical interaction and functional synergism. Methods We performed co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to identify the interactions of TRPP2 and STIM1 in transfected HEK293 cells and native vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The function of the TRPP2-STIM1 complex in thapsigargin (TG) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced SOCE was explored using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Further, we created TRPP2 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse to investigate the functional role of TRPP2 in agonist-induced vessel contraction. Results TRPP2 and STIM1 form a complex in transfected HEK293 cells and native VSMCs. Genetic manipulations with TRPP2 siRNA, dominant negative TRPP2 or STIM1 siRNA significantly suppressed ATP and TG-induced intracellular Ca2+ release and SOCE in HEK293 cells. Inositol triphosphate receptor inhibitor 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2APB) abolished ATP-induced Ca2+ release and SOCE in HEK293 cells. In addition, TRPP2 and STIM1 knockdown significantly inhibited ATP- and TG-induced STIM1 puncta formation and SOCE in VSMCs. Importantly, knockdown of TRPP2 and STIM1 or conditional knockout TRPP2 markedly suppressed agonist-induced mouse aorta contraction. Conclusions Our data indicate that TRPP2 and STIM1 are physically associated and form a functional complex to regulate agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, SOCE and blood vessel tone.

32867691/Identification and characterization of the bacteriocin Carocin S3 from the multiple bacteriocin producing strain of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum Background Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which causes soft-rot disease in numerous plants worldwide resulting in significant economic losses. Results from our previous studies showed that the strain H-rif-8-6 produces low-molecular-weight bacteriocin (LMWB) Carocin S1. Interestingly, TH22-10, the caroS1K:Tn5 insertional mutant in H-rif-8-6, loses Carocin S1 producing ability, but still produces other LMWBs which the indicator strain SP33 can detect. The SP33 is one of the many strains that are sensitive toward the cytotoxic effects of Carocin S3K, but not Carocin S1. The result revealed that H-rif-8-6 is a multiple-bacteriocin producing strain. Results In this study, a 4.1-kb DNA fragment was isolated from the chromosomal DNA of Pcc strain, H-rif-8-6, by a DNA probe using the caroS1K gene as the template. DNA sequencing and analysis by GenBank revealed two complete open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF1 and ORF2, which were identified within the sequence fragment. ORF1 and ORF2, similar to the identified carocin S2 genes, encode the killer (Carocin S3K) and the immunity (Carocin S3I) proteins, respectively, which were homologous to the colicin E3 gene. Carocin S3K and Carocin S3I were expressed, isolated, and purified in Escherichia coli BL21 after subcloning of the expression plasmid pGS3KI or pGSK3I. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the relative masses of Carocin S3K and Carocin S3I were 95.6 kDa and 10.2 kDa, respectively. The results reveal that Carocin S3K has higher antimicrobial and specific antimicrobial activities for Pcc along with a nuclease activity than Carocin S3I. However, Carocin S3I inhibits the activity of Carocin S3K. Interestingly, a high concentration of Carocin S3I protein is also a DNA nuclease, and Carocin S3K also inhibits its activity. Conclusion This study showed that another type of bacteriocin was found in Pectobacterium carotovorum. This new type of bacteriocin, Carocin S3, has the killer protein, Carocin S3K, and the immunity protein, Carocin S3I.
32878596/The role of the globular heads of the C1q receptor in TcdA-induced human colonic epithelial cell apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway Background Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. Studies have demonstrated that C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) can cause apoptosis of many human cell types. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among exposure to TcdA, the role of the receptor for the globular heads of C1q (gC1qR) gene and the underlying intracellular apoptotic mechanism in human colonic epithelial cells (NCM 460). In this study, gC1qR expression was examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Cell viability was assessed by the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay, and cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Mitochondrial function was assessed based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and the content of ATP. Results Our study demonstrated that increasing the concentration of TcdA from 10 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis (p < 0.01). Moreover, the TcdA-induced gC1qR expression and enhanced expression of gC1qR caused mitochondrial dysfunction (including production of ROS and decreases in the DeltaPsim and the content of ATP) and cell apoptosis. However, silencing of the gC1qR gene reversed TcdA-induced cell apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusion These data support a mechanism by which gC1qR plays a crucial role in TcdA-induced apoptosis of human colonic epithelial cells in a mitochondria-dependent manner.
32718931/Effect of serotonin modulation on dystrophin-deficient zebrafish ABSTRACT Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle-wasting disease caused by mutation of the dystrophin gene. Pharmacological therapies that function independently of dystrophin and complement strategies aimed at dystrophin restoration could significantly improve patient outcomes. Previous observations have suggested that serotonin pathway modulation ameliorates dystrophic pathology, and re-application of serotonin modulators already used clinically would potentially hasten availability to DMD patients. In our study, we used dystrophin-deficient sapje and sapje-like zebrafish models of DMD for rapid and easy screening of several classes of serotonin pathway modulators as potential therapeutics. None of the candidate drugs tested significantly decreased the percentage of zebrafish exhibiting the dystrophic muscle phenotype in the short-term birefringence assay or lengthened the lifespan in the long-term survival assay. Although we did not identify an effective drug, we believe our data is of value to the DMD research community for future studies, and there is evidence that suggests serotonin modulation may still be a viable treatment strategy with further investigation. Given the widespread clinical use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase, their reapplication to DMD is an attractive strategy in the field's pursuit to identify pharmacological therapies to complement dystrophin restoration strategies. Summary: Phenotypic screening of serotonin pathway modulators has been performed in DMD zebrafish in order to identify small-molecules that limit the dystrophic muscle phenotype and lengthen the lifespan as potential therapeutics.
32747447/Vardenafil increases intracellular accumulation of the most prevalent mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) in human bronchial epithelial cells ABSTRACT Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by progressive lung and chronic digestive manifestations. We have shown that therapeutic doses of vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, corrects CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR)-dependent chloride transport in respiratory and intestinal tissues of F508del homozygous mice. Here, we studied the effect of vardenafil on CFTR in 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- cell lines. First, the expression levels of PDE5 mRNA in these cell lines were monitored. The two cell lines were exposed to different drugs (dimethyl sulfoxide, 8-Br-cGMP, forskolin or vardenafil). The cAMP and cGMP intracellular concentrations were measured. Finally, we localised the CFTR by immunolabelling. PDE5 was similarly expressed in both wild-type and in CF cells. A fast and transient rise in cGMP intracellular contents followed treatment with vardenafil, confirming its PDE5 inhibitory effect. We showed that vardenafil promoted both the early steps of the cellular processing and the trafficking of F508del without fully addressing the protein to the plasma membrane. The effect was not reproduced by the brominated cGMP analogue and it was not prevented by the combination of a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor and vardenafil. These findings support the view that vardenafil partially rescues F508del through cGMP/PKG-independent mechanisms. Summary: Our findings support the view that vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, partially rescues F508del protein through cGMP/PKG-independent mechanisms in cystic fibrosis cell line.
32894044/Effects of continuous infusion of phenylephrine vs. norepinephrine on parturients and fetuses under LiDCOrapid monitoring: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study Background Hypotension following spinal anesthesia (SA) during cesarean delivery (CD) occurs commonly and is related with maternal and fetal complications. Norepinephrine infusion is increasingly used for prevention of post-SA hypotension; however, its effects as compared to the traditional phenylephrine infusion remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine administered as continuous infusion during elective CD on maternal hemodynamic parameters and maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study included 238 consecutive term parturients who underwent CD from February 2019 to October 2019. They were randomized to receive continuous infusion of 0.25 mug/kg/min phenylephrine, 0.05 mug/kg/min norepinephrine, or placebo. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed at 10 time points using LiDCOrapid. We analyzed umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery (UA), and peripheral vein (PV) blood gas indexes and recorded intraoperative complications. Results In phenylephrine group, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) remain during the whole operation. Compared to the control group, phenylephrine, but not norepinephrine, significantly increased the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to counteract the SA-induced vasodilatation, 3 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T4): 957.4 +- 590.3 vs 590.1 +- 273.7 (P < 0.000001); 5 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T5): 1104 +- 468.0 vs 789.4 +- 376.2 (P = 0.000002). at the time of incision (T6): 1084 +- 524.8 vs 825.2 +- 428.6 (P = 0.000188). Parturients in the phenylephrine group had significantly lower UV (1.91 +- 0.43) (P = 0.0003) and UA (2.05 +- 0.61) (P = 0.0038) lactate level compared to controls. Moreover, the UV pH value was higher in the phenylephrine than in the control group7.37 +- 0.03(P = 0.0013). Parturients had lower incidence of nausea, tachycardia, hypotension in phenylephrine group. Conclusions In this dataset, continuous phenylephrine infusion reduced the incidence of SA-induced hypotension, ameliorated SVR, while decreasing overall maternal complications. Phenylephrine infusions are considered the better choice during CD because of the significant benefit to the fetus.

32894141/Repositioning liothyronine for cancer immunotherapy by blocking the interaction of immune checkpoint TIGIT/PVR Background Inhibitors targeting immune checkpoint were proved effective in cancer immunotherapy, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The novel immune checkpoint TIGIT/PVR plays critical roles in suppressing the anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T and NK cells, and dual blockade of TIGIT/PVR and PD-1/PD-L1 by antibody can elicit synergistic effects in tumor models and clinical trials. However, small molecules for TIGIT/PVR blockade have not been investigated. Methods The expression of PVR in tumors were analyzed by using TCGA, Oncomine and GEO database, and in cancer cell lines examined by flow cytometry. Natural product compounds were docked to PVR for virtual screening by using the software Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Candidate compounds were further tested by biolayer interferometry-based binding assay, microscale thermophoresis assay and cell based blocking assay. The in vitro activity of the candidate compound was determined by MTT, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) activation assay and coculture assay. The anti-tumor effects and mechanism were also investigated by using MC38 tumor-bearing mice model and immune cell depletion tumor model. Results PVR was over-expressed in many tumor tissues and cancer cell lines, making it a promising therapeutic target. Through virtual screening, binding, and blocking assay, liothyronine was discovered to bind PVR and block the interaction of TIGIT/PVR. Liothyronine could enhance the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PBMCs. Besides, in the Jurkat-hTIGIT and CHOK1-hPVR coculture assay, liothyronine could reverse the IL-2 secretion inhibition resulted by TIGIT/PVR ligation. Although had no influence on the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro, liothyronine could significantly inhibit tumor growth when administrated in vivo, by enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and immune responses in the tumor bearing mice. The immune cell depletion model showed that the anti-tumor effects of liothyronine depends on CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Conclusions A small molecule liothyronine was discovered to serve as a potential candidate for cancer immunotherapy by blocking the immune checkpoint TIGIT/PVR. Video abstract Graphical abstract
32891143/The combined utilization of Chlorhexidine and Voriconazole or Natamycin to combat Fusarium infections Background Fusarium species are the fungal pathogens most commonly responsible for the mycotic keratitis, which are resistant to the majority of currently available antifungal agents. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of a combination of low doses chlorhexidine with two other commonly used drugs (voriconazole and natamycin) to treat Fusarium infections. Results We utilized combinations of chlorhexidine and natamycin or voriconazole against 20 clinical Fusarium strains in vitro using a checkerboard-based microdilution strategy. In order to more fully understand the synergistic interactions between voriconazole and chlorhexidine, we utilized a Galleria mellonella model to confirm the combined antifungal efficacy of chlorhexidine and voriconazole in vivo. We found that for voriconazole, natamycin, and chlorhexidine as single agents, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges were 2-8, 4-16, and > 16 mug/ml, respectively. In contrast, the MIC values for voriconazole and chlorhexidine were reduced to 0.25-1 and 1-2 mug/ml, respectively, when these agents were administered in combination, with synergy being observed for 90% of tested Fusarium strains. Combined chlorhexidine and natamycin treatment, in contrast, exhibited synergistic activity for only 10% of tested Fusarium strains. We observed no evidence of antagonism. Our in vivo model results further confirmed the synergistic antifungal activity of chlorhexidine and voriconazole. Conclusions Our results offer novel evidence that voriconazole and chlorhexidine exhibit synergistic activity when used to suppress the growth of Fusarium spp., and these agents may thus offer value as a combination topical antifungal treatment strategy.
32894054/Maternal sciatic nerve administered bupivacaine induces hippocampal cell apoptosis in offspring Background Bupivacaine, an amid-type local anesthetic, is widely used for clinical patients especially in pregnant women. In addition to neurotoxicity effect of bupivacaine, it can cross the placenta, accumulates in this tissue and retained in fetal tissues. Nevertheless, whether bupivacaine can cause neurotoxicity in fetus remains unclear. Hence, this study was design to investigate the effects of maternal bupivacaine use on fetus hippocampal cell apoptosis and the possible related mechanism. Methods On day 15 of pregnancy, sciatic nerve of pregnant wistar rat (180-200 g) were exposed by lateral incision of the right thigh and 0.2 ml of bupivacaine was injected. After their delivery, we randomly selected one male offspring of every mother. On day 30 after of their birth, the rat's hippocampi were isolated for molecular studies. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and p-Akt in fetal hippocampus. Results Our results showed that maternal bupivacaine use caused a significant increment of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in fetal hippocampus compared with the sham group. In addition, maternally administered bupivacaine could significantly decrease hippocampal P.Akt/T.Akt ratio which was concurrent with an increment of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression. Conclusion Our data suggest that maternal bupivacaine use increases fetal hippocampal cell apoptosis markers such as caspase 8 and cleaved caspase 3, at least in part, via inhibiting the Akt activation.
32891136/Efficacy of different dose of dexmedetomidine combined with remifentanil in colonoscopy: a randomized controlled trial Background Dexmedetomidine has advantages during colonoscopy as it allows the patient to cooperate during the procedure. Few studies examined the dexmedetomidine-remifentanil combination. This study was to evaluate the effects of different doses of the dexmedetomidine-remifentanil combination in colonoscopy. Methods This was a prospective trial carried out at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 02/2018 and 10/2018. The patients were randomized: group I (dexmedetomidine 0.2 mug kg- 1), group II (dexmedetomidine 0.3 mug kg- 1), and group III (dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug kg- 1), all combined with remifentanil. The primary outcomes were the patient's body movements during the procedure and adverse events. Results Compared with at admission (T0), the SBP, HR, and RR at immediately after giving DEX (T1), at the beginning of the examination (T2), 5 min after the beginning of the examination (T3), 10 min after the beginning of the examination (T4), and at the end of the examination (T5) in the three groups were all reduced (all P < 0.05), but all were within the clinically normal range. SpO2 remained > 98% in all patients during the examination. Compared with T0, the BIS values of the three groups were decreased at T1 and T2 (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BIS among the three groups (all P > 0.05). The minimum BIS value in group III was lower than in groups I and II (P < 0.05). The degree of satisfaction with the anesthesia effect was higher in groups II and III that in group I (P < 0.05). No hypotension occurred, seven patients had bradycardia, and four patients had nausea/vomiting. Conclusions Dexmedetomidine 0.3 mug kg- 1 combined with remifentanil was effective for colonoscopy and had few adverse reactions.

32894042/Effect of sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol on gastrointestinal motility in lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemic mice Background Sepsis often accompanies gastrointestinal motility disorder that contributes to the development of sepsis in turn. Propofol and dexmedetomidine, as widely used sedatives in patients with sepsis, are likely to depress gastrointestinal peristalsis. We queried whether propofol or dexmedetomidine, at sedative doses, aggravated sepsis-induced ileus. Methods Sedative/Anesthetic Scores and vital signs of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemic mice were measured during sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine. Endotoxemic mice were divided into 10% fat emulsion, propofol, saline, and dexmedetomidine group. The gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, tests of colonic motility, gastrointestinal transit and whole gut transit were evaluated at 15 mins and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of sedatives/vehicles respectively. Results 40 mg kg- 1propofol and 80 mug kg- 1 dexmedetomidine induced a similar depth of sedation with comparable vital signs except that dexmedetomidine strikingly decreased heart rate in endotoxemic mice. Dexmedetomidine markedly inhibited gastric emptying (P = 0.006), small intestinal transit (P = 0.006), colonic transit (P = 0.0006), gastrointestinal transit (P = 0.0001) and the whole gut transit (P = 0.034) compared with the vehicle, whereas propofol showed no depression on all parts of gastrointestinal motility 15 mins after administration. The inhibitive effects of dexmedetomidine in these tests vanished 24 h after the administration. Conclusions Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine, but not propofol, significantly inhibited gastrointestinal peristalsis in endotoxemic mice while the inhibitory effect disappeared 24 h after sedation. These data suggested that both propofol and dexmedetomidine could be applied in septic patients while dexmedetomidine should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease or ileus.
32894182/Point prevalence survey of antimicrobial use in three hospitals in North-Eastern Tanzania Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent global health threats with low-resource countries being disproportionately affected. Targeted interventions require insight in antibiotic prescription practices. A point prevalence survey (PPS) is a well-known tool to get insight in antibiotic dispensing practices in hospitals and identify areas for improvement. Here, we describe the results of a PPS performed in a tertiary, regional and district hospital in Kilimanjaro region in Tanzania. Methods A PPS was performed in the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC; tertiary hospital), Mawenzi (regional) and St. Joseph (district) hospital in November and December 2016. Antibiotic use in all patients admitted more than 24 h and those undergoing surgery was recorded. All clinical wards were included except the pediatrics. Data from a single ward were collected on the same day. Results A total of 399 patients were included in the PPS: 232 patients from KCMC, 94 from Mawenzi hospital and 73 patients from St. Joseph hospital. Overall prevalence of antibiotic use was 44.0%: 38% in KCMC, 59% in Mawenzi and 63% in St. Joseph. Ceftriaxone (n = 94, 29.8%), metronidazole (n = 79, 23.9%) and other antibiotics belonging to the penicillin class (n = 89, 28.3%) were most commonly prescribed. Antibiotics prescribed for surgical prophylaxis were continued for more than 3 days in 57% of cases. Conclusion Our study shows a rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in Tanzanian hospitals and prolonged surgical antibiotic prophylaxis being a common practice. PPS is an important tool to improve future antibiotic use in Tanzania hospitals.
32894139/Molecular basis of carrageenan-induced cytokines production in macrophages Background Low molecular weight carrageenan (Cg) is a seaweed-derived sulfated polysaccharide widely used as inflammatory stimulus in preclinical studies. However, the molecular mechanisms of Cg-induced inflammation are not fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular basis involved in Cg-induced macrophages activation and cytokines production. Methods Primary culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with Kappa Cg. The supernatant and cell lysate were used for ELISA, western blotting, immunofluorescence. Cg-induced mouse colitis was also developed. Results Here we show that Cg activates peritoneal macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1beta. While Cg-induced TNF production/secretion depends on TLR4/MyD88 signaling, the production of pro-IL-1beta relies on TLR4/TRIF/SYK/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. The maturation of pro-IL1beta into IL-1beta is dependent on canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Pannexin-1/P2X7/K+ efflux signaling. In vivo, Cg-induced colitis was reduced in mice in the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Conclusions In conclusion, we unravel a critical role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in Cg-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production and colitis, which is an important discovery on the pro-inflammatory properties of this sulfated polysaccharide for pre-clinical studies. Video abstract Graphical Abstract Carrageenan (Cg) is one the most used flogistic stimulus in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of Cg-induced inflammation is not totally elucidated. Herein, Lopes et al. unraveled the molecular basis for Cg-induced macrophages production of biological active IL-1beta. The Cg-stimulated macrophages produces pro-IL-1beta depends on TLR4/TRIF/Syk/ROS, whereas its processing into mature IL-1beta is dependent on the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. 
32900361/The relationship between the level of mu-opioid receptor (muORs) and postoperative analgesic use in patients undergoing septoplasty: a prospective randomized controlled trial Background In this study, the mu-Opioid receptor activity was assessed pre-operatively for its association with postoperative pain level and second analgesic requirement in patients undergoing septoplasty. Methods In our prospective study, 120 adult patients underwent septoplasty from June 2015 to January 2019 were randomly divided into 2 pre-operative groups. The first group (n = 60) was patients given tramadol (1-2 mg/kg) for post-operative analgesia, and the second group (control group) (n = 60) was initially prescribed only fentanyl (1 mug/ kg-i.v.) in the induction. Acetaminophen with codeine analgesic 325/30 mg (p.o.) was used as an rescue painkiller in the post-operative period. The mu-Opioid receptor activity was investigated in pre-operative blood samples and compared to post-operative pain level and time required for second round of analgesic administration. The visual analogue score (VAS) was used to evaluate the post-operative pain degree (0 no pain; 10 worst pain). The patients' post-operative VAS scores were evaluated upon arrival to recovery room, and at the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 10th, and 24th hour post-operative period. Results Demographic data and peri-operative variables were similar in both study group (p < 0.05).There was no significant difference between the receptor levels in both groups and the mean receptor level was 200.94 +- 15.34 pg/mL (max:489.92 +- 22.36 pg/mL, min: 94.56 +- 11.23 pg/mL).In patients who used tramadol as the levels of mu-Opioid receptors increased, VAS scores of patients and second analgesic use decreased in post-operative period.The VAS scores in patients with higher receptor levels were lower in the recovery room (p < 0.05), 1st (p < 0.05) and 3rd hours (p < 0.05).The VAS scores were lower in the tramadol group compared to the control group (p < 0.05).Number of secondary analgesic requirement was significantly lower in patients of the tramadol group with higher receptor levels compared to the ones with lower receptor (p < 0.05) for arrival at the recovery room and 1st hour. Patients in the tramadol group needed a second pain killer much later than patients in the control group. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that patients with higher muOR levels have a higher efficacy of opioid analgesic agents and an lesser need for additional analgesic agents. Trial registration This trial was registered retrospectively (The ACTRN: ACTRN12619001652167, registration date: 26/11/2019).
32912139/Griseococcin (1) from Bovistella radicata (Mont.) Pat and antifungal activity Background To evaluate the antimicrobial and microbicidel activity of B. radicata fermentation broth, the broth was purified by DEAE-cellulose and sephadex LC-20 column. The compounds were submitted to spectral analyses (HPLC, FT-IR, 1D and 2D NMR etc.). Results The purified compounds were identified as the Griseococcin(s) which were naphthoquinone derivatives, the Chemical formula and MW of Griseococcin (1) was determined as C37O10H43N and 661 Da. only Griseococcin (1) has good antimicrobial activity among the Griseococcin(s). The zone of inhibition (ZOI), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) or minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of Griseococcin (1) were used to investigate the antimicrobial activity. Antifungal activity of Griseococcin (1) was significant, especially for main pathogenic fungus Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, MFC/MIC of Griseococcin (1) was 1, while MFC/MIC of postive control was greater than 4, the fungicidal effect of Griseococcin (1) was better than that of positive control. Conclusions In this paper, the secondary metabolite compound Griseococcin (1) from B. radicata was purified. The purified compound can restrain main pathogens (T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes) leading to tinea pedis. The antifungal activity of Griseococcin (1) was similar to that of the positive control and the fungicidal effect of Griseococcin (1) was better than that of positive control, it might be suitable for pharmaceutical industries.
32912151/Genotyping and plant-derived glycan utilization analysis of Bifidobacterium strains from mother-infant pairs Background Bifidobacteria are important probiotics; some of the beneficial effects of bifidobacteria are achieved by the hydrolysis of glycans in the human gut. However, because the diet of breastfed infants typically lacks plant-derived glycans, in the gut environment of mothers and their breastfed infants, the mother will intake a variety of plant-derived glycans, such as from onions and bananas, through her diet. Under this assumption, we are interested in whether the same species of bifidobacteria isolated from mother-infant pairs present a distinction in their hydrolysis of plant-derived carbohydrates. Results Among the 36 Bifidobacterium strains, bifidobacterial carbohydrate utilization showed two trends related to the intestinal environment where the bacteria lived. Compared with infant-type bifidobacterial strains, adult-type bifidobacterial strains preferred to use plant-derived glycans. Of these strains, 10 isolates, 2 Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (B. pseudocatenulatum), 2 Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B. pseudolongum), 2 Bifidobacterium bifidum (B. bifidum), 2 Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve), and 2 Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum), were shared between the mother-infant pairs. Moreover, the repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) results illustrated that B. pseudolongum and B. bifidum showed genotypic similarities of 95.3 and 98.2%, respectively. Combined with the carbohydrate fermentation study, these results indicated that the adult-type strains have a stronger ability to use plant-derived glycans than infant-type strains. Our work suggests that bifidobacterial carbohydrate metabolism differences resulted in the selective adaptation to the distinct intestinal environment of an adult or breastfed infant. Conclusions The present study revealed that the different gut environments can lead to the differences in the polysaccharide utilization in the same strains of bifidobacterial strains, suggesting a further goal of investigating the exact expression of certain enzymes in response to specific carbon sources.
32912335/SIRT3 deficiency exacerbates fatty liver by attenuating the HIF1alpha-LIPIN 1 pathway and increasing CD36 through Nrf2 Background Deficiency of mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that maintains redox status and lipid homeostasis, contributes to hepatic steatosis. In this study, we investigated additional mechanisms that might play a role in aggravating hepatic steatosis in Sirt3-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Methods Studies were conducted in wild-type (WT) and Sirt3-/- mice fed a standard diet or a HFD and in SIRT3-knockdown human Huh-7 hepatoma cells. Results Sirt3-/- mice fed a HFD presented exacerbated hepatic steatosis that was accompanied by decreased expression and DNA-binding activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and of several of its target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, compared to WT mice fed the HFD. Interestingly, Sirt3 deficiency in liver and its knockdown in Huh-7 cells resulted in upregulation of the nuclear levels of LIPIN1, a PPARalpha co-activator, and of the protein that controls its levels and localization, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). These changes were prevented by lipid exposure through a mechanism that might involve a decrease in succinate levels. Finally, Sirt3-/- mice fed the HFD showed increased levels of some proteins involved in lipid uptake, such as CD36 and the VLDL receptor. The upregulation in CD36 was confirmed in Huh-7 cells treated with a SIRT3 inhibitor or transfected with SIRT3 siRNA and incubated with palmitate, an effect that was prevented by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. Conclusion These findings demonstrate new mechanisms by which Sirt3 deficiency contributes to hepatic steatosis. Video abstract Graphical abstract
32907599/G protein-coupled receptors function as cell membrane receptors for the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone Abstract G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell membrane receptors for various ligands. Recent studies have suggested that GPCRs transmit animal steroid hormone signals. Certain GPCRs have been shown to bind steroid hormones, for example, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) binds estrogen in humans, and Drosophila dopamine/ecdysteroid receptor (DopEcR) binds the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in insects. This review summarizes the research progress on GPCRs as animal steroid hormone cell membrane receptors, including the nuclear and cell membrane receptors of steroid hormones in mammals and insects, the 20E signaling cascade via GPCRs, termination of 20E signaling, and the relationship between genomic action and the nongenomic action of 20E. Studies indicate that 20E induces a signal via GPCRs to regulate rapid cellular responses, including rapid Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and influx from the extracellular medium, as well as rapid protein phosphorylation and subcellular translocation. 20E via the GPCR/Ca2+/PKC/signaling axis and the GPCR/cAMP/PKA-signaling axis regulates gene transcription by adjusting transcription complex formation and DNA binding activity. GPCRs can bind 20E in the cell membrane and after being isolated, suggesting GPCRs as cell membrane receptors of 20E. This review deepens our understanding of GPCRs as steroid hormone cell membrane receptors and the GPCR-mediated signaling pathway of 20E (20E-GPCR pathway), which will promote further study of steroid hormone signaling via GPCRs, and presents GPCRs as targets to explore new pharmaceutical materials to treat steroid hormone-related diseases or control pest insects.

32917142/Effects of graphene oxide on PCR amplification for microbial community survey Background Graphene oxide (GO) has been suggested as an efficient assistant additive to eliminate non-specific amplification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although many studies have focused on exploring its molecular mechanism, the practice of GO on the quantitation of microbial community has not been implemented yet. In this study, GO was added in PCR system to explore the changes on removing typical amplification errors, such as chimera and mismatches on two kinds of mock communities (an evenly mixed and a staggered mock communities) and environmental samples. Results High-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal communities, based on 16S rRNA genes and internal transcribed spacers (ITS) respectively, showed that GO could significantly increase large segmental error (chimeric sequence) in PCR procedure while had no specific effect on point error (mismatched sequence). Besides, GO reduced the alpha-diversity of community, and changed the composition of fungal community more obviously than bacterial community. Conclusions Our study provides the first quantitative data on microbial community level to prove the negative effect of GO, and also indicates that there may be a more complex interaction between GO and comprehensive DNA fragments in PCR process.
32928109/Intracellular Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome of the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii DL1 Background To respond and adapt to environmental challenges, prokaryotes regulate cellular processes rapidly and reversibly through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. This study investigates the intracellular proteome and Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome of the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii. Intracellular proteins from planktonic cells of S. gordonii DL1 were extracted and subjected to 2D-gel electrophoresis. Proteins in general were visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue and T-Rex staining. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized with Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain. Proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS and sequence analysis. Results In total, sixty-one intracellular proteins were identified in S. gordonii DL1, many of which occurred at multiple isoelectric points. Nineteen of these proteins were present as one or more Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylated form. The identified phosphoproteins turned out to be involved in a variety of cellular processes. Conclusion Nineteen phosphoproteins involved in various cellular functions were identified in S. gordonii. This is the first time the global intracellular Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation profile has been analysed in an oral streptococcus. Comparison with phosphoproteomes of other species from previous studies showed many similarities. Proteins that are consistently found in a phosphorylated state across several species and growth conditions may represent a core phosphoproteome profile shared by many bacteria.
32919465/Triglyceride glucose index for the detection of asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis in patients with type 2 diabetes Background Triglyceride Glucose (TyG) index has been associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular events. Silent coronary disease is common in patients with type 2 diabetes. In Vietnam, a low-middle income country, the burden of cardiovascular disease is growing simultaneously with the epidemiologic transition. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of coronary stenoses (CS) in patients with type 2 diabetes and no history or symptom of cardiovascular disease and to investigate the association between TyG index and cardiovascular risk factors and both the presence and severity of CS. Futhermore, we assessed the value of TyG index in predicting subclinical CS. Methods This was a cross-sectional observational study. We recruited 166 patients at Ninh Thuan General Hospital, Vietnam. TyG index and HOMA-IR were calculated, and a coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was performed. Results The population was classified according to tertiles of TyG index. The highest TyG values were associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, plasma glucose, HbA1c levels and HOMA-IR, lower HDL-cholesterol, a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome and less frequent physical activity (p < 0.05 to < 0.0001). TyG index correlated with logHOMA-IR (p < 0.0001). CS >= 50% were present in 60 participants and 32 had coronary artery stenosis >= 70%. TyG index and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in patients with CS >= 70%. The number of narrowed coronary arteries and the degree of stenosis were associated with higher TyG index levels (p = 0.04 and < 0.005 respectively). A TyG index >= 10 was significantly associated with an increased risk of multiple coronary artery disease and of more severe CS. After adjusting for confounding factors, including logHOMA-IR, these risks remained mostly significant. A TyG index threshold at 10 resulted in 57% sensitivity and 75% specificity for predicting the presence of CS >= 70%. In subgroup analysis TyG index >= 10 was associated with an increased risk in CS >= 70% in patients treated with statin or antiplatelet therapy. Conclusion More than one third of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes had significant CS on CCTA. TyG index may be considered as a marker for insulin resistance and increased TyG index could identify patients with high risk of coronary artery stenoses and is associated with the number and the severity of artery stenoses.
32928115/Characterization of carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from hospitalized patients in the mid-south region of China Background Acinetobacter baumannii has traditionally been considered an opportunistic pathogen with low virulence. In this study, we characterized the carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent A. baumannii (CR-hvAB) stains isolated from our hospital in mid-south region of China. Results Blood samples collected between January 2017 and May 2019 were used for virulence experiments and biofilm assays of individual carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CR-AB) strains, performed using a Galleria mellonella infection model and crystal violet staining method, respectively. CR-AB isolates that induced high mortality in the G. mellonella infection model were subjected to genotyping, susceptibility testing, and clinical data analysis, and the genetic characterization of these isolates was performed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Among the 109 CR-AB clinical strains, the survival rate of G. mellonella larvae infected with 7 (6.4%) CR-AB isolates (number of strains with mortality of 0, 10 and 20% was 4, 1, and 2, respectively), was significantly lower than that of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (100.0%) and the remaining CR-AB isolates (> 80.0%). Consistent with these results, patients infected with these seven isolates had an average 7-day mortality rate of 42.9%, suggesting that the isolates were CR-hvAB. These seven isolates belonged to four sequence types (STs): ST457, ST195, ST369, and ST2088 (a new ST), and mainly ST457 (n = 4). The results of the biofilm study showed that eight strains had powerful biofilm ability (strong [n = 1] and moderate [n = 7] biofilm producers) including these seven CR-hvAB isolates. Conclusions CR-hvAB isolates that induced a high mortality rate were cloned in our hospital, most of which belonged to ST457; thus, monitoring of these strains, particularly ST457, should be strengthened in the future. Meanwhile, A. baumannii, which was isolated from blood specimens and found to powerful biofilm-forming ability, is a probable hvAB isolate.
32928123/Relative abundance of the Prevotella genus within the human gut microbiota of elderly volunteers determines the inter-individual responses to dietary supplementation with wheat bran arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides Background The human colon is colonised by a dense microbial community whose species composition and metabolism are linked to health and disease. The main energy sources for colonic bacteria are dietary polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. These play a major role in modulating gut microbial composition and metabolism, which in turn can impact on health outcomes. Results We investigated the influence of wheat bran arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) and maltodextrin supplements in modulating the composition of the colonic microbiota and metabolites in healthy adults over the age of 60. Male and female volunteers, (n = 21, mean BMI 25.2 +- 0.7 kg/m2) participated in the double-blind, cross over supplement study. Faecal samples were collected for analysis of microbiota, short chain fatty acids levels and calprotectin. Blood samples were collected to measure glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides levels. There was no change in these markers nor in calprotectin levels in response to the supplements. Both supplements were well-tolerated by the volunteers. Microbiota analysis across the whole volunteer cohort revealed a significant increase in the proportional abundance of faecal Bifidobacterium species (P <= 0.01) in response to AXOS, but not maltodextrin, supplementation. There was considerable inter-individual variation in the other bacterial taxa that responded, with a clear stratification of volunteers as either Prevotella-plus (n = 8; > 0.1% proportional abundance) or Prevotella-minus (n = 13; <=0.1% proportional abundance) subjects founded on baseline sample profiles. There was a significant increase in the proportional abundance of both faecal Bifidobacterium (P <= 0.01) and Prevotella species (P <= 0.01) in Prevotella-plus volunteers during AXOS supplementation, while Prevotella and Bacteroides relative abundances showed an inverse relationship. Proportional abundance of 26 OTUs, including bifidobacteria and Anaerostipes hadrus, differed significantly between baseline samples of Prevotella-plus compared to Prevotella-minus individuals. Conclusions The wheat bran AXOS supplementation was bifidogenic and resulted in changes in human gut microbiota composition that depended on the initial microbiota profile, specifically the presence or absence of Prevotella spp. as a major component of the microbiota. Our data therefore suggest that initial profiling of individuals through gut microbiota analysis should be considered important when contemplating nutritional interventions that rely on prebiotics.

32938382/Effect of divalent ions on cariogenic biofilm formation Background Divalent cations are able to interact with exopolysaccharides (EPS) and thus are capable to modify the structure and composition of dental biofilm. At the moment, little is known about the adsorption of metals by cariogenic EPS; thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of divalent ions (calcium, magnesium, and zinc) on the growth and biofilm formation of mutans streptococci and on the dissolution of hydroxyapatite as well as to investigate their binding to the bacterial EPS. Results S. mutans strains used in this study show the highest tolerance towards calcium of the ions tested. Growth parameters showed no differences to control condition for both strains up to 100 mM; revealing natural tolerance to higher concentration of calcium in the surroundings. Although excessive levels of calcium did not impair the growth parameters, it also did not have a positive effect on biofilm formation or its binding affinity to EPS. Magnesium-saturated environment proved to be counterproductive as strains were able to dissolve more Ca2+ from the tooth surface in the presence of magnesium, therefore releasing excessive amounts of Ca2+ in the environment and leading to the progression of the disease. Thus, this supports the idea of self-regulation, when more Ca2+ is released, more calcium is bound to the biofilm strengthening its structure and however, also less is left for remineralization. Zinc inhibited bacterial adhesion already at low concentrations and had a strong antibacterial effect on the strains as well as on calcium dissolution; leading to less biofilm and less EPS. Additionally, Zn2+ had almost always the lowest affinity to all EPS; thus, the unbound zinc could also still remain in the surrounding environment and keep its antimicrobial properties. Conclusion It is important to maintain a stable relationship between calcium, magnesium and zinc as excessive concentrations of one can easily destroy the balance between the three in cariogenic environment and lead to progression of the disease.
32938386/A small dose of dezocine suppresses remifentanil-induced cough in general anesthesia induction: a prospective, randomized, controlled study Background The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to evaluate whether pretreatment with a small dose of dezocine could prevent remifentanil-induced cough in general anesthesia induction. Trial design a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Methods A total of 210 patients receiving elective operative hysteroscopy from December 2018 to April 2019 were enrolled in the present study. They were randomly equally separated into dezocine group (n = 105) and control group (n = 105). Patients were intravenously pre-administrated with dezocine 0.03 mg/kg (diluted to 5 mL) or the same volume of normal saline 1 min prior to remifentanil infusion. One minute later, intravenous injection of propofol 1.5 mg/kg and cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg were given to all patients for induction of general anesthesia. The counts of coughs occurred during the anesthesia induction period were recorded and the severity of cough was scaled. Results There were 7 cases of mild cough in dezocine group and 18 cases of mild cough, 12 cases of moderate cough and 4 cases of severe cough in control group. The incidence rate of cough was significantly lower and the severity of cough was obviously relieved in dezocine group compared to control group (6.67% vs. 32.38%, P <  0.001). The two groups were not significantly different in heart rate and mean arterial pressure before the induction, before and after the intubation, and in operating time and postoperative visual analog scale pain scores. Conclusion This study recommends the efficacy and safety of a pretreatment with a small dose of dezocine in reducing remifentanil-induced cough during general anesthesia.

32943609/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway induces autophagy-mediated temozolomide-resistance in human glioblastoma Temozolomide (TMZ) is widely used for treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), however, the treatment of such brain tumors remains a challenge due to the development of resistance. Increasing studies have found that TMZ treatment could induce autophagy that may link to therapeutic resistance in GBM, but, the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of GBM to chemotherapy is paramount for developing improved cancer therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrated that the loss of DOC-2/DAB2 interacting protein (DAB2IP) is responsible for TMZ-resistance in GBM through ATG9B. DAB2IP sensitized GBM to TMZ and suppressed TMZ-induced autophagy by negatively regulating ATG9B expression. A higher level of ATG9B expression was associated with GBM compared to low-grade glioma. The knockdown of ATG9B expression in GBM cells suppressed TMZ-induced autophagy as well as TMZ-resistance. Furthermore, we showed that DAB2IP negatively regulated ATG9B expression by blocking the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. To enhance the benefit of TMZ and avoid therapeutic resistance, effective combination strategies were tested using a small molecule inhibitor blocking the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in addition to TMZ. The combination treatment synergistically enhanced the efficacy of TMZ in GBM cells. In conclusion, the present study identified the mechanisms of TMZ-resistance of GBM mediated by DAB2IP and ATG9B which provides insight into a potential strategy to overcome TMZ chemo-resistance.
32943614/Four-octyl itaconate activates Nrf2 cascade to protect osteoblasts from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury Four-octyl itaconate (4-OI) is the cell-permeable derivative of itaconate that can activate Nrf2 signaling by alkylating Keap1's cysteine residues. Here, we tested the potential effect of 4-OI on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative injury in osteoblasts. In OB-6 cells and primary murine osteoblasts, 4-OI was able to activate Nrf2 signaling cascade and cause Keap1-Nrf2 disassociation, Nrf2 protein stabilization, cytosol accumulation, and nuclear translocation. 4-OI also augmented antioxidant-response element reporter activity and promoted expression of Nrf2-dependent genes (HO1, NQO1, and GCLC). Pretreatment with 4-OI inhibited H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species production, cell death, and apoptosis in osteoblasts. Furthermore, 4-OI inhibited H2O2-induced programmed necrosis by suppressing mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial cyclophilin D-ANT1 (adenine nucleotide translocase 1)-p53 association, and cytosol lactate dehydrogenase release in osteoblasts. Ectopic overexpression of immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) increased endogenous itaconate production and activated Nrf2 signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting H2O2-induced oxidative injury and cell death. In OB-6 cells, Nrf2 silencing or CRISPR/Cas9-induced Nrf2 knockout blocked 4-OI-induced osteoblast cytoprotection against H2O2. Conversely, forced Nrf2 activation, by CRISPR/Cas9-induced Keap1 knockout, mimicked 4-OI-induced actions in OB-6 cells. Importantly, 4-OI was ineffective against H2O2 in Keap1-knockout cells. Collectively, 4-OI efficiently activates Nrf2 signaling to inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative injury and death of osteoblasts.
32943607/Reactive oxygen species mediate anlotinib-induced apoptosis via activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic cancer Anlotinib (AL3818), a novel multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has recently been proven to be an antitumour drug. This study aimed to explore the antitumour effect of anlotinib and its underlying molecular mechanisms in human pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. The anti-proliferative effect of anlotinib for three PC cell lines was validated using CCK-8, colony formation and EdU detection assays. Cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assays, a PC xenograft model and immunohistochemistry were performed to elucidate the mechanisms by which anlotinib induced tumour lethality in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrated that anlotinib inhibited proliferation, induced G2/M phase arrest and triggered apoptosis in PC cell lines. Anlotinib induced PC's apoptosis through the accumulation of ROS which activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via PERK/p-eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression level of Nrf2, an antioxidant protein, increased with anlotinib treatment. Nrf2 knockdown enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of anlotinib and the expression of the PERK/p-eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway. The in vivo results suggested that suppressing Nrf2 improved the antitumour effect of anlotinib on PC cells. These data indicated that the apoptotic effect of anlotinib on PC cells was induced by ER stress via the accumulation of ROS. In the future, anlotinib combined with an Nrf2 inhibitor may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human PC.
32943612/The triterpenoid sapogenin (2alpha-OH-Protopanoxadiol) ameliorates metabolic syndrome via the intestinal FXR/GLP-1 axis through gut microbiota remodelling Gypenosides, extracts of Gynostemma yixingense, have been traditionally prescribed to improve metabolic syndrome in Asian folk and local traditional medicine hospitals. However, the mechanism of its action remains unclarified. In this work, our results indicated that chronic administration of 2alpha-OH-protopanoxadiol (GP2), a metabolite of gypenosides in vivo, protected mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity and improved glucose tolerance by improving intestinal L-cell function. Mechanistically, GP2 treatment inhibited the enzymatic activity of bile salt hydrolase and modulated the proportions of the gut microbiota, which led to an increase in the accumulation of tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TbetaMCA) in the intestine. TbetaMCA induced GLP-1 production and secretion by reducing the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Transplantation of GP2-remodelled fecal microbiota into antibiotic-treated mice also increased the intestinal TbetaMCA content and improved intestinal L-cell function. These findings demonstrate that GP2 ameliorates metabolic syndrome at least partly through the intestinal FXR/GLP-1 axis via gut microbiota remodelling and also suggest that GP2 may serve as a promising oral therapeutic agent for metabolic syndrome.
32943002/NGF receptors and PI3K/AKT pathway involved in glucose fluctuation-induced damage to neurons and alpha-lipoic acid treatment Background Glucose fluctuation promotes neuronal apoptosis, which plays a central role in diabetic encephalopathy (DE). Nerve growth factor (NGF), and its interaction with high-affinity (TrkA) and low-affinity (p75NTR) receptors, are involved in neuronal survival. NGF/TrkA contributes to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is beneficial for neuronal survival, and alpha-Lipoic acid (ALA) exerts clinically favorable neuroprotective effects in the periphery. Whether NGF receptors and the PI3K/AKT pathway are involved in glucose fluctuation-induced neuronal damage, as well as the potential molecular mechanism of ALA in protecting glucose fluctuation-induced neuronal damage, remain unclear. Results The results indicated that constant high glucose (CHG) and intermittent high glucose (IHG) significantly increased the expression of Bax and caspase-3, and decreased the expression of TrkA/p75NTR and p-AKT/AKT, while ALA stimulation reversed the above proteins in PC12 cells. IHG stimulates apoptosis more effectively than CHG in PC12 cells, which is related to the PI3K/AKT pathway but not to the TrkA/p75NTR. Furthermore, neuronal apoptosis induced by IHG was aggravated by the TrkA inhibitor K252a or the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002, but this effect was alleviated by the p75NTR inhibitor TAT-pep5. Conclusion Glucose fluctuation induced cell apoptosis by regulating the TrkA/p75NTR and PI3K/AKT pathway, meanwhile ALA exhibited neuroprotective effects in response to IHG and CHG. These observations indicated that the PI3K/AKT pathway and the balance of TrkA/p75NTR are likely to serve as potential therapeutic targets for DE. In addition, ALA could be a possible therapeutic drug for DE.
32948210/Thrombospondin-1/CD47 signaling modulates transmembrane cation conductance, survival, and deformability of human red blood cells Background Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a Ca2+-binding trimeric glycoprotein secreted by multiple cell types, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several clinical conditions. Signaling involving TSP-1, through its cognate receptor CD47, orchestrates a wide array of cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization, migration, cell-cell interaction, cell proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the impact of TSP-1/CD47 signaling on Ca2+ dynamics, survival, and deformability of human red blood cells (RBCs). Methods Whole-cell patch-clamp was employed to examine transmembrane cation conductance. RBC intracellular Ca2+ levels and multiple indices of RBC cell death were determined using cytofluorometry analysis. RBC morphology and microvesiculation were examined using imaging flow cytometry. RBC deformability was measured using laser-assisted optical rotational cell analyzer. Results Exposure of RBCs to recombinant human TSP-1 significantly increased RBC intracellular Ca2+ levels. As judged by electrophysiology experiments, TSP-1 treatment elicited an amiloride-sensitive inward current alluding to a possible Ca2+ influx via non-selective cation channels. Exogenous TSP-1 promoted microparticle shedding as well as enhancing Ca2+- and nitric oxide-mediated RBC cell death. Monoclonal (mouse IgG1) antibody-mediated CD47 ligation using 1F7 recapitulated the cell death-inducing effects of TSP-1. Furthermore, TSP-1 treatment altered RBC cell shape and stiffness (maximum elongation index). Conclusions Taken together, our data unravel a new role for TSP-1/CD47 signaling in mediating Ca2+ influx into RBCs, a mechanism potentially contributing to their dysfunction in a variety of systemic diseases.

32957929/Effects of different sufentanil target concentrations on the MACBAR of sevoflurane in patients with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum stimulus Background This study aims to observe the effects of different target controlled plasma sufentanil concentrations on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane for blocking adrenergic response (BAR) in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum stimulation. Methods Eighty-five patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, aged 30-65 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II, were enrolled in this study. All the patients were randomly divided into 5 groups (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4) with different sufentanil plasma target concentration (0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 ng ml- 1). Anesthesia was induced by inhalation of 8% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen, and 0.6 mg kg- 1 of rocuronium was intravenously injected to facilitate the insertion of a laryngeal mask airway. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and sufentanil plasma target concentration were adjusted according to respective preset value in each group. The hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum stimulus was observed after the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration had been maintained stable at least for 15 min. The MACBAR of sevoflurane was measured by a sequential method. Meanwhile, epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in the blood were also determined before and after pneumoperitoneum stimulus in each group. Results When the method of independent paired reversals was used, the MACBAR of sevoflurane in groups S0, S1, S2, S3, S4 was 5.333% (confidence interval [CI] 95%: 5.197-5.469%), 4.533% (95% CI: 4.451-4.616%), 2.861% (95% CI: 2.752-2.981%), 2.233% (95% CI: 2.142-2.324%) and 2.139% (95% CI: 2.057-2.219%), respectively. Meanwhile, when the isotonic regression analysis was used, the MACBAR of sevoflurane in groups S0, S1, S2, S3, S4 was 5.329% (95% CI: 5.321-5.343%), 4.557% (95% CI: 4.552-4.568%), 2.900% (95% CI: 2.894-2.911%), 2.216% (95% CI: 2.173-2.223%) and 2.171% (95% CI: 2.165-2.183%), respectively. The MACBAR was not significantly different between groups S3 and S4 when using 0.5 and 0.7 ng ml- 1 of sufentanil plasma target concentrations. No significant difference was found in the change of E or NE concentration between before and after pneumoperitoneum stimulation in each group. Conclusions The MACBAR of sevoflurane can be decreased with increasing sufentanil plasma target concentrations. A ceiling effect of the decrease occurred at a sufentanil plasma target concentration of 0.5 ng ml- 1. When the sympathetic adrenergic response was inhibited in half of the patients to pneumoperitoneum stimulation in each group, the changes of E and NE concentrations showed no significant differences.

32957926/Antinociceptive effects of magnesium sulfate for monitored anesthesia care during hysteroscopy: a randomized controlled study Background Opioids are the most effective antinociceptive agents, they have undesirable side effects such as respiratory depressant and postoperative nausea and vomiting. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the antinociceptive efficacy of adjuvant magnesium sulphate to reduce intraoperative and postoperative opioids requirements and their related side effects during hysteroscopy. Methods Seventy patients scheduled for hysteroscopy were randomly divided into 2 groups. Patients in the magnesium group (Group M) received intravenous magnesium sulfate 50 mg/kg in 100 ml of isotonic saline over 15 min before anesthesia induction and then 15 mg/kg per hour by continuous intravenous infusion. Patients in the control group (Group C) received an equal volume of isotonic saline as placebo. All patients were anesthetized under a BIS guided monitored anesthesia care with propofol and fentanyl. Intraoperative hemodynamic variables were recorded and postoperative pain scores were assessed with verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) 1 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h after recovery of consciousness. The primary outcome of our study was total amount of intraoperative and postoperative analgesics administered. Results Postoperative serum magnesium concentrations in Group C were significantly decreased than preoperative levels (0.86 +- 0.06 to 0.80 +- 0.08 mmol/L, P = 0.001) while there was no statistical change in Group M (0.86 +- 0.07 to 0.89 +- 0.07 mmol/L, P = 0.129). Bradycardia did not occur in either group and the incidence of hypotension was comparable between the two groups. Total dose of fentanyl given to patients in Group M was less than the one administered to Group C [100 (75-150) vs 145 (75-175) mug, median (range); P < 0.001]. In addition, patients receiving magnesium displayed lower VNRS scores at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h postoperatively. Conclusions In hysteroscopy, adjuvant magnesium administration is beneficial to reduce intraoperative fentanyl requirement and postoperative pain without cardiovascular side effects. Our study indicates that if surgical patients have risk factors for hypomagnesemia, assessing and correcting magnesium level will be necessary.

32957914/Root-associated endophytic bacterial community composition and structure of three medicinal licorices and their changes with the growing year Background The dried roots and rhizomes of medicinal licorices are widely used worldwide as a traditional medicinal herb, which are mainly attributed to a variety of bioactive compounds that can be extracted from licorice root. Endophytes and plants form a symbiotic relationship, which is an important source of host secondary metabolites. Results In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing technology and high-performance liquid chromatography to explore the composition and structure of the endophytic bacterial community and the content of bioactive compounds (glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin and total flavonoids) in different species of medicinal licorices (Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and Glycyrrhiza inflata) and in different planting years (1-3 years). Our results showed that the contents of the bioactive compounds in the roots of medicinal licorices were not affected by the species, but were significantly affected by the main effect growing year (1-3) (P < 0.05), and with a trend of stable increase in the contents observed with each growing year. In 27 samples, a total of 1,979,531 effective sequences were obtained after quality control, and 2432 effective operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at 97% identity. The phylum Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the genera unified-Rhizobiaceae, Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, and Pantoea were significantly dominant in the 27 samples. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) showed that the content of total flavonoids explained the differences in composition and distribution of endophytic bacterial communities in roots of cultivated medicinal liquorices to the greatest extent. Total soil salt was the most important factor that significantly affected the endophytic bacterial community in soil factors, followed by ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. Among the leaf nutrition factors, leaf water content had the most significant effect on the endophytic bacterial community, followed by total phosphorus and total potassium. Conclusions This study not only provides information on the composition and distribution of endophytic bacteria in the roots of medicinal licorices, but also reveals the influence of abiotic factors on the community of endophytic bacteria and bioactive compounds, which provides a reference for improving the quality of licorice.
32967609/Autoreceptor control of serotonin dynamics Background Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that has been linked to a wide variety of behaviors including feeding and body-weight regulation, social hierarchies, aggression and suicidality, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcoholism, anxiety, and affective disorders. Full understanding involves genomics, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, and behavior. The scientific issues are daunting but important for human health because of the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other pharmacological agents to treat disorders. This paper presents a new deterministic model of serotonin metabolism and a new systems population model that takes into account the large variation in enzyme and transporter expression levels, tryptophan input, and autoreceptor function. Results We discuss the steady state of the model and the steady state distribution of extracellular serotonin under different hypotheses on the autoreceptors and we show the effect of tryptophan input on the steady state and the effect of meals. We use the deterministic model to interpret experimental data on the responses in the hippocampus of male and female mice, and to illustrate the short-time dynamics of the autoreceptors. We show there are likely two reuptake mechanisms for serotonin and that the autoreceptors have long-lasting influence and compare our results to measurements of serotonin dynamics in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. We also show how histamine affects serotonin dynamics. We examine experimental data that show very variable response curves in populations of mice and ask how much variation in parameters in the model is necessary to produce the observed variation in the data. Finally, we show how the systems population model can potentially be used to investigate specific biological and clinical questions. Conclusions We have shown that our new models can be used to investigate the effects of tryptophan input and meals and the behavior of experimental response curves in different brain nuclei. The systems population model incorporates individual variation and can be used to investigate clinical questions and the variation in drug efficacy. The codes for both the deterministic model and the systems population model are available from the authors and can be used by other researchers to investigate the serotonergic system.
32967720/Increasing use of linezolid in a tertiary NICU during a 10-year period: reasons and concerns for the future Background Linezolid has been increasingly used in tertiary NICUs. The objectives of this study were to explore the indications of these linezolid prescriptions, to analyze a possible misuse and to provide solutions to avoid such misuse. Methods A monocentric retrospective cohort study included all neonates hospitalized in one tertiary NICU between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2019 and who received at least one administration of linezolid. These data were confronted to epidemiological and antibiotic use data from the same NICU. Two independent pediatricians secondarily classified linezolid uses as adequate or not. Results During the study period, 66 infections in 57 patients led to linezolid use. Most patients were pre-term and 21 patients (37%) died. Infections were mainly related to methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci and were frequently either pneumoniae (35%) or isolated bacteremia (48%), including 25 persistent bacteremia (64% of the 39 bacteremia). Need for a better tissue distribution or first-line treatment failure were the main reasons to initiate linezolid. Linezolid was administered for a median duration of 7 [3;10] days. No side effects were reported. Twenty-two (33%) of the 66 linezolid prescriptions were retrospectively classified as inadequate. Conclusions A rapid increase in linezolid prescriptions has been observed in our tertiary NICU, from 2014 to 2019, with 33% inadequate uses. This worrisome trend should lead to search for therapeutic alternatives and to work on antibiotic stewardship to prevent the emergence of new antimicrobial bacterial resistance.
32977744/Measurement of drug concentration and bacterial contamination after diluting morphine for intrathecal administration: an experimental study Background Low concentrations of morphine are required for safe dosing for intrathecal injections. Sometimes, manual dilution of morphine is performed to achieve these low concentrations, but risks dilution errors and bacterial contamination. The primary goal was to compare the concentrations of morphine and bupivacaine between four groups of syringes. The secondary goal was to investigate the difference in contamination rate between these groups. Methods Twenty-five experienced anesthesia providers were asked to prepare a mixture of bupivacaine 2.0 mg/ml and morphine 60 mug/ml using 3 different methods as clean and precise as possible. The fourth method used was the aspiration of ampoules prepared by the pharmacy. The concentrations of morphine and bupivacaine were measured by High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The medication was cultured for bacterial contamination. Results Group 1 (median 60 mug/ml; 95% CI: 59-110 mug/ml) yielded 3 outliers above 180 mug/ml morphine concentration. Group 2 (76 mug/ml; 95% CI: 72-80 mug/ml) and 3 (69 mug/ml; 95% CI: 66-71 mug/ml) were consistently higher than the target concentration of 60 mug. The group "pharmacy" was precise and accurate (59 mug/ml; 95% CI: 59-59 mug/ml). Group 2 and "pharmacy" had one contaminated sample with a spore-forming aerobic gram-positive rod. Conclusion Manually diluted morphine is at risk for deviating concentrations, which could lead to increased side-effects. Medication produced by the hospital pharmacy was highly accurate. Furthermore, even when precautions are undertaken, contamination of the medication is a serious risk and appeared to be unrelated to the dilution process.
32972415/Association of glucose uptake of visceral fat and acute myocardial infarction: a pilot 18F-FDG PET/CT study Background Inflamed visceral adipose tissue (VAT) facilitates chronic inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions thereby leading to increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we evaluated the glucose uptake of VAT and the carotid artery with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and their association with CAD, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods A total of 90 participants were enrolled (32 with AMI, 33 with chronic stable angina; CSA, and 25 control participants) and undertook 18F-FDG PET/CT. VAT glucose uptake was measured by using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of VAT region. The target-to-background ratio (TBR) of carotid artery was defined as the SUVmax of carotid artery divided by the SUVmax of jugular vein. The SUVmax of spleen, bone-marrow (BM), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were used for the assessment of systemic inflammatory activity. Results VAT SUVmax was highest in participants with AMI, intermediate in participants with CSA, and lowest in control participants. Carotid artery TBR and systemic inflammatory surrogate markers including spleen SUVmax, BM SUVmax, and hsCRP were also higher in the AMI group than in the CSA or control group. Furthermore, VAT SUVmax showed significant positive correlation with carotid artery TBR, spleen SUVmax, BM SUVmax, and hsCRP. In multivariate linear regression and logistic regression analyses, VAT SUVmax was independently associated with carotid artery TBR and AMI. Conclusions Glucose uptake of VAT assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT was associated with the severity of CAD and synchronized with the carotid artery inflammation in participants with CAD.
32977835/Antimicrobial resistance in Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile derived from humans: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile is an important pathogen of healthcare- associated diarrhea, however, an increase in the occurrence of C. difficile infection (CDI) outside hospital settings has been reported. The accumulation of antimicrobial resistance in C. difficile can increase the risk of CDI development and/or its spread. The limited number of antimicrobials for the treatment of CDI is matter of some concern. Objectives In order to summarize the data on antimicrobial resistance to C. difficile derived from humans, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Methods We searched five bibliographic databases: (MEDLINE [PubMed], Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) for studies that focused on antimicrobial susceptibility testing in C. difficile and were published between 1992 and 2019. The weighted pooled resistance (WPR) for each antimicrobial agent was calculated using a random- effects model. Results A total of 111 studies were included. The WPR for metronidazole and vancomycin was 1.0% (95% CI 0-3%) and 1% (95% CI 0-2%) for the breakpoint > 2 mg/L and 0% (95% CI 0%) for breakpoint >=32 mug/ml. Rifampin and tigecycline had a WPRs of 37.0% (95% CI 18-58%) and 1% (95% CI 0-3%), respectively. The WPRs for the other antimicrobials were as follows: ciprofloxacin 95% (95% CI 85-100%), moxifloxacin 32% (95% CI 25-40%), clindamycin 59% (95% CI 53-65%), amoxicillin/clavulanate 0% (0-0%), piperacillin/tazobactam 0% (0-0%) and ceftriaxone 47% (95% CI 29-65%). Tetracycline had a WPR 20% (95% CI 14-27%) and meropenem showed 0% (95% CI 0-1%); resistance to fidaxomicin was reported in one isolate (0.08%). Conclusion Resistance to metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam is reported rarely. From the alternative CDI drug treatments, tigecycline had a lower resistance rate than rifampin. The high-risk antimicrobials for CDI development showed a high level of resistance, the highest was seen in the second generation of fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; amoxicillin/clavulanate showed almost no resistance. Tetracycline resistance was present in one fifth of human clinical C. difficile isolates.
32977855/Effects of restrictive-prescribing stewardship on antibiotic consumption in primary care in China: an interrupted time series analysis, 2012-2017 Background The overuse of antibiotics has been a major public health problem worldwide, especially in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). However, there are few policies specific to antibiotic stewardship in primary care and their effectiveness are still unclear. A restrictive-prescribing stewardship targeting antibiotic use in primary care has been implemented since December 2014 in Hubei Province, China. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the restrictive-prescribing stewardship on antibiotic consumption in primary care so as to provide evidence-based suggestions for prudent use of antibiotics. Methods Monthly antibiotic consumption data were extracted from Hubei Medical Procurement Administrative Agency (HMPA) system from Sept 1, 2012, to Aug 31, 2017. Quality Indictors of European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC QIs) combined with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) methodology were applied to measure antibiotic consumption. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of restrictive-prescribing stewardship on antibiotic consumption. Results Over the entire study period, a significant reduction (32.58% decrease) was observed in total antibiotic consumption, which declined immediately after intervention (coefficient = - 2.4518, P = 0.005) and showed a downward trend (coefficient = - 0.1193, P = 0.017). Specifically, the use of penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides/lincosamides/streptogramins showed declined trends after intervention (coefficient = - 0.0553, P = 0.035; coefficient = - 0.0294, P = 0.037; coefficient = - 0.0182, P = 0.003, respectively). An immediate decline was also found in the contribution of beta-lactamase-sensitive penicillins to total antibiotic use (coefficient = - 2.9126, P = 0.001). However, an immediate increase in the contribution of third and fourth-generation cephalosporins (coefficient = 5.0352, P = 0.005) and an ascending trend in the contribution of fluoroquinolones (coefficient = 0.0406, P = 0.037) were observed after intervention. The stewardship led to an immediate increase in the ratio between broad- and narrow-spectrum antibiotic use (coefficient = 1.8747, P = 0.001) though they both had a significant downward trend (coefficient = - 0.0423, P = 0.017; coefficient = - 0.0223, P = 0.006, respectively). An immediate decline (coefficient = - 1.9292, P = 0.002) and a downward trend (coefficient = - 0.0815, P = 0.018) were also found in the oral antibiotic use after intervention, but no significant changes were observed in the parenteral antibiotic use. Conclusions Restrictive-prescribing stewardship in primary care was effective in reducing total antibiotic consumption, especially the use of penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides/lincosamides/streptogramins. However, the intervention effects were limited regarding the use of combinations of penicillins with ss-lactamase inhibitors, the third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and parenteral antibiotics. Stronger administrative regulations focusing on specific targeted antibiotics, especially the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and parenteral antibiotics, are in urgent need in the future.
32977831/Effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on cardiac sympathetic activity in acute myocardial infarction patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the EMBODY trial Background Protection from lethal ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a crucial challenge after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity can be noninvasively assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT). The EMBODY trial was designed to determine whether the Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor improves cardiac nerve activity. Methods This prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients with AMI and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Japan; 105 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily 10-mg empagliflozin or placebo. The primary endpoints were changes in HRV, e.g., the standard deviation of all 5-min mean normal RR intervals (SDANN) and the low-frequency-to-high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in other sudden cardiac death (SCD) surrogate markers such as HRT. Results Overall, 96 patients were included (46, empagliflozin group; 50, placebo group). The changes in SDANN were + 11.6 and + 9.1 ms in the empagliflozin (P = 0.02) and placebo groups (P = 0.06), respectively. Change in LF/HF ratio was - 0.57 and - 0.17 in the empagliflozin (P = 0.01) and placebo groups (P = 0.43), respectively. Significant improvement was noted in HRT only in the empagliflozin group (P = 0.01). Whereas intergroup comparison on HRV and HRT showed no significant difference between the empagliflozin and placebo groups. Compared with the placebo group, the empagliflozin group showed significant decreases in body weight, systolic blood pressure, and uric acid. In the empagliflozin group, no adverse events were observed. Conclusions This is the first randomized clinical data to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in patients with T2DM and AMI. Early SGLT2 inhibitor administration in AMI patients with T2DM might be effective in improving cardiac nerve activity without any adverse events. Trial Registration: The EMBODY trial was registered by the UMIN in November 2017 (ID: 000030158). UMIN000030158; https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000034442.
32979921/Metformin may adversely affect orthostatic blood pressure recovery in patients with type 2 diabetes: substudy from the placebo-controlled Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy (CIMT) trial Background Metformin has been shown to have both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metformin in combination with insulin on cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and distal peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods The study is a sub-study of the CIMT trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 3 factorial design, where 412 patients with T2DM were randomized to 18 months of metformin or placebo in addition to open-labelled insulin. Outcomes were measures of CAN: Changes in heart rate response to deep breathing (beat-to-beat), orthostatic blood pressure (OBP) and heart rate and vibration detection threshold (VDT) as a marker DPN. Serum levels of vitamin B12 and methyl malonic acid (MMA) were analysed. Results After 18 months early drop in OBP (30 s after standing) was increased in the metformin group compared to placebo: systolic blood pressure drop increased by 3.4 mmHg (95% CI 0.6; 6.2, p = 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure drop increased by 1.3 mmHg (95% CI 0.3; 2.6, p = 0.045) compared to placebo. Beat-to-beat variation decreased in the metformin group by 1.1 beats per minute (95% CI - 2.4; 0.2, p = 0.10). Metformin treatment did not affect VDT group difference - 0.33 V (95% CI - 1.99; 1.33, p = 0.39) or other outcomes. Changes in B12, MMA and HbA1c did not confound the associations. Conclusions Eighteen months of metformin treatment in combination with insulin compared with insulin alone increased early drop in OBP indicating an adverse effect of metformin on CAN independent of vitamin B12, MMA HbA1c. Trial registration The protocol was approved by the Regional Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (H-D-2007-112), the Danish Medicines Agency and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00657943).
32979918/Combination therapy with pemafibrate (K-877) and pitavastatin improves vascular endothelial dysfunction in dahl/salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt and high-fat diet Background Statins suppress the progression of atherosclerosis by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Pemafibrate (K-877), a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator, is expected to reduce residual risk factors including high triglycerides (TGs) and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol during statin treatment. However, it is not known if statin therapy with add-on pemafibrate improves the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combination therapy with pitavastatin and pemafibrate on lipid profiles and endothelial dysfunction in hypertension and insulin resistance model rats. Methods Seven-week-old male Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats were divided into the following five treatment groups (normal diet (ND) plus vehicle, high-salt and high-fat diet (HD) plus vehicle, HD plus pitavastatin (0.3 mg/kg/day), HD plus pemafibrate (K-877) (0.5 mg/kg/day), and HD plus combination of pitavastatin and pemafibrate) and treated for 12 weeks. At 19 weeks, endothelium-dependent relaxation of the thoracic aorta in response to acetylcholine was evaluated. Results After feeding for 12 weeks, systolic blood pressure and plasma levels of total cholesterol were significantly higher in the HD-vehicle group compared with the ND-vehicle group. Combination therapy with pitavastatin and pemafibrate significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, TG levels, including total, chylomicron (CM), very LDL (VLDL), HDL-TG, and cholesterol levels, including total, CM, VLDL, and LDL-cholesterol, compared with vehicle treatment. Acetylcholine caused concentration-dependent relaxation of thoracic aorta rings that were pre-contracted with phenylephrine in all rats. Relaxation rates in the HD-vehicle group were significantly lower compared with the ND-vehicle group. Relaxation rates in the HD-combination of pitavastatin and pemafibrate group significantly increased compared with the HD-vehicle group, although neither medication alone ameliorated relaxation rates significantly. Western blotting experiments showed increased phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression in aortas from rats in the HD-pemafibrate group and the HD-combination group compared with the HD-vehicle group. However, the expression levels did not respond significantly to pitavastatin alone. Conclusions Combination therapy with pitavastatin and pemafibrate improved lipid profiles and endothelial dysfunction in hypertension and insulin resistance model rats. Pemafibrate as an add-on strategy to statins may be useful for preventing atherosclerosis progression.
32783282/MicroRNA-203-mediated inhibition of doublecortin underpins cardioprotection conferred by sevoflurane in rats after myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury Abstract Myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious illness with high morbidity and mortality. Mounting evidence indicates the utility of sevoflurane (SEV) in the treatment of myocardial I/R injury. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective action of SEV against myocardial I/R injury. A rat model of myocardial I/R injury was established, and I/R rats were treated with different concentrations of SEV. MicroRNA-203 (miR-203) and doublecortin (DCX) expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Putative target relationship between miR-203 and DCX was explored using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay. Ischaemia-reperfusion rats were treated with SEV, miR-203 antagomir or sh-DCX, followed by determination of oxidative stress- and inflammation-related factor levels using nitrite and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and that of apoptosis-related factors using Western blot analysis. The apoptotic rate of myocardial tissues was determined using TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and the infract area was evaluated using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The results showed miR-203 was poorly expressed and DCX was highly expressed in myocardial tissues of I/R rats. Sevoflurane was found to elevate miR-203, and miR-203, in turn, could target and reduce DCX expression. Sevoflurane, miR-203 overexpression or DCX silencing resulted in declined oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and infarct area, ultimately alleviating myocardial I/R injury. Collectively, these findings showed that SEV-activated miR-203 exhibited suppressive effects on myocardial I/R injury in rats and highlighted the SEV/miR-203/DCX axis as a promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury management.
32697044/beta-Methylphenylalanine exerts neuroprotective effects in a Parkinson's disease model by protecting against tyrosine hydroxylase depletion Abstract We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of beta-methylphenylalanine in an experimental model of rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in SH-SY5Y cells and rats. Cells were pre-treated with rotenone (2.5 microg/mL) for 24 hours followed by beta-methylphenylalanine (1, 10 and 100 mg/L) for 72 hours. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial fragmentation, apoptosis, and mRNA and protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase were determined. In a rat model of PD, dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, bradykinesia and tyrosine hydroxylase expression were determined. In rotenone-pre-treated cells, beta-methylphenylalanine significantly increased cell viability and MMP, whereas ROS levels, apoptosis and fragmented mitochondria were reduced. beta-Methylphenylalanine significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase in SH-SY5Y cells. In the rotenone-induced rat model of PD, oral administration of beta-methylphenylalanine recovered DA and DOPAC levels and bradykinesia. beta-Methylphenylalanine significantly increased the protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum and substantia nigra of rats. In addition, in silico molecular docking confirmed binding between tyrosine hydroxylase and beta-methylphenylalanine. Our experimental results show neuroprotective effects of beta-methylphenylalanine via the recovery of mitochondrial damage and protection against the depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase. We propose that beta-methylphenylalanine may be useful in the treatment of PD.
32762026/The identification of six risk genes for ovarian cancer platinum response based on global network algorithm and verification analysis Abstract Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer, and resistance of platinum-based chemotherapy is the main reason for treatment failure. The aim of the present study was to identify candidate genes involved in ovarian cancer platinum response by analysing genes from homologous recombination and Fanconi anaemia pathways. Associations between these two functional genes were explored in the study, and we performed a random walk algorithm based on reconstructed gene-gene network, including protein-protein interaction and co-expression relations. Following the random walk, all genes were ranked and GSEA analysis showed that the biological functions focused primarily on autophagy, histone modification and gluconeogenesis. Based on three types of seed nodes, the top two genes were utilized as examples. We selected a total of six candidate genes (FANCA, FANCG, POLD1, KDM1A, BLM and BRCA1) for subsequent verification. The validation results of the six candidate genes have significance in three independent ovarian cancer data sets with platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive information. To explore the correlation between biomarkers and clinical prognostic factors, we performed differential analysis and multivariate clinical subgroup analysis for six candidate genes at both mRNA and protein levels. And each of the six candidate genes and their neighbouring genes with a mutation rate greater than 10% were also analysed by network construction and functional enrichment analysis. In the meanwhile, the survival analysis for platinum-treated patients was performed in the current study. Finally, the RT-qPCR assay was used to determine the performance of candidate genes in ovarian cancer platinum response. Taken together, this research demonstrated that comprehensive bioinformatics methods could help to understand the molecular mechanism of platinum response and provide new strategies for overcoming platinum resistance in ovarian cancer treatment.
32693431/Imprinting aberrations of SNRPN, ZAC1 and INPP5F genes involved in the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease with extracardiac malformations Abstract Congenital heart disease (CHD) with extracardiac malformations (EM) is the most common multiple malformation, resulting from the interaction between genetic abnormalities and environmental factors. Most studies have attributed the causes of CHD with EM to chromosomal abnormalities. However, multi-system dysplasia is usually caused by both genetic mutations and epigenetic dysregulation. The epigenetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CHD with EM remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of imprinting alterations, including those of the Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN), PLAG1 like zinc finger 1 (ZAC1) and inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase F (INPP5F) genes, in the pathogenesis of CHD with EM. The methylation levels of SNRPN, ZAC1, and INPP5F genes were analysed by the MassARRAY platform in 24 children with CHD with EM and 20 healthy controls. The expression levels of these genes were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The correlation between methylation regulation and gene expression was confirmed using 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) treated cells. The methylation levels of SNRPN and ZAC1 genes were significantly increased in CHD with EM, while that of INPP5F was decreased. The methylation alterations of these genes were negatively correlated with expression. Risk analysis showed that abnormal hypermethylation of SNRPN and ZAC1 resulted in 5.545 and 7.438 times higher risks of CHD with EM, respectively, and the abnormal hypomethylation of INPP5F was 8.38 times higher than that of the control group. We concluded that abnormally high methylation levels of SNRPN and ZAC1 and decreased levels of INPP5F imply an increased risk of CHD with EM by altering their gene functions. This study provides evidence of imprinted regulation in the pathogenesis of multiple malformations.
32779844/Tacrolimus ameliorates tubulointerstitial inflammation in diabetic nephropathy via inhibiting the NFATc1/TRPC6 pathway Abstract Tubulointerstitial inflammation is crucial for the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN), and tubular cells act as a driving force in the inflammatory cascade. Emerging data suggested that tacrolimus (TAC) ameliorates podocyte injury and macrophage infiltration in streptozotocin (STZ) mice. However, the effect of TAC on tubulointerstitial inflammation remains unknown. We found that albuminuria and tubulointerstitial damage improved in db/db mice treated with TAC. Macrophage infiltration and expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, fibronectin, collagen 1 and cleaved caspase 3 were inhibited as well. In addition, the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1) and transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) was up-regulated in the kidneys of DN patients and correlated with tubular injury and inflammation. The expression of NFATc1 and TRPC6 also increased in the kidneys of db/db mice and HK-2 cells with high glucose (HG), while TAC inhibited these effects. HG-induced inflammatory markers and apoptosis were reversed by TAC and NFATc1 siRNA in HK-2 cells, which was abolished by TRPC6 plasmid. Furthermore, HG-induced TRPC6 expression was inhibited by NFATc1 siRNA, while NFATc1 nuclear translocation was inhibited by TAC, but was restored by TRPC6 plasmid in HK-2 cells under HG conditions. These findings suggest that TAC ameliorates tubulointerstitial inflammation in DN through NFATc1/TRPC6 feedback loop.
32767741/Combined pre-conditioning with salidroside and hypoxia improves proliferation, migration and stress tolerance of adipose-derived stem cells Abstract Oxidative stress after ischaemia impairs the function of transplanted stem cells. Increasing evidence has suggested that either salidroside (SAL) or hypoxia regulates growth of stem cells. However, the role of SAL in regulating function of hypoxia-pre-conditioned stem cells remains elusive. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of SAL and hypoxia pre-conditionings on the proliferation, migration and tolerance against oxidative stress in rat adipose-derived stem cells (rASCs). rASCs treated with SAL under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2) were analysed for the cell viability, proliferation, migration and resistance against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In addition, the activation of Akt, Erk1/2, LC3, NF-kappaB and apoptosis-associated pathways was assayed by Western blot. The results showed that SAL and hypoxia treatments synergistically enhanced the viability (fold) and proliferation of rASCs under non-stressed conditions in association with increased autophagic flux and activation of Akt, Erk1/2 and LC3. H2O2-induced oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagic cell death and NF-kappaB activation were inhibited by SAL or hypoxia, and further attenuated by the combined SAL and hypoxia pre-treatment. The SAL and hypoxia pre-treatment also enhanced the proliferation and migration of rASCs under oxidative stress in association with Akt and Erk1/2 activation; however, the combined pre-treatment exhibited a more profound enhancement in the migration than proliferation. Our data suggest that SAL combined with hypoxia pre-conditioning may enhance the therapeutic capacity of ASCs in post-ischaemic repair.
32981521/Long-term prognostic utility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) triglyceride in real-world patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes or prediabetes Background Recent guidelines highlighted the association between atherosclerosis and triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins in patients with impaired glucose metabolism. However, evidence from prospective studies for long-term prognostic utility of low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (LDL-TG) in real-world patients with prediabetes (Pre-DM) or diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is currently not available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of LDL-TG on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with stable CAD under different glucose metabolism status. Methods A total of 4381 patients with CAD were consecutively enrolled and plasma LDL-TG level was measured by an automated homogeneous assay. They were categorized according to both status of glucose metabolism [DM, Pre-DM, normal glycaemia regulation (NGR)] and tertiles of LDL-TG. All subjects were followed up for the occurrence of MACEs. Results During a median of 5.1 (interquartile range 3.9 to 5.9) years' follow-up, 507 (11.6%) MACEs occurred. Cubic spline models showed a significant association between LDL-TG and MACEs in DM and Pre-DM but not in NGR. When the combined effect of elevated LDL-TG and glucose disorders was considered for risk stratification, the medium tertile of LDL-TG plus DM, and the highest tertile of LDL-TG plus Pre-DM or plus DM subgroups were associated with significantly higher risk of MACEs after adjustment of confounders including triglyceride [hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals): 1.843 (1.149-2.955), 1.828 (1.165-2.867), 2.212 (1.396-3.507), all p < 0.05]. Moreover, adding LDL-TG into the original model increased the C-statistic from 0.687 to 0.704 ( C-statistic = 0.016, p = 0.028) and from 0.734 to 0.749 ( C-statistic = 0.014, p = 0.002) in Pre-DM and DM, respectively. Conclusions In this longitudinal cohort study on real-world practice, higher LDL-TG was associated with worse outcomes among Pre-DM and DM patients with stable CAD.
32993528/Analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided paravertebral block in percutaneous nephrolithotomy patients: a randomized controlled clinical study Background Paravertabral blocks (PVB) are in use to adequately manage pain arising from a variety of operations on the thorax, abdomen or pelvis. PVB is straightforward, efficacious in operations performed. This study was undertaken to evaluate how efficacious ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block is when used in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCN). Methods A total of 44 patients, falling in categories I to III of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and aged between 18 and 65 years, who were scheduled for PCN, were randomly distributed into two groups. The anaesthetic intervention group (PVB) contained 22 individuals, who were injected at level T8-T9 with 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine as a single administration. In the control group C, also containing 22 individuals, the intervention was not carried out. The groups were compared after PCN in terms of opioid use, pain score, opioid adverse effects profile and the need for supplemental analgesia. Results Visual analogue scale pain scores whilst at rest or moving were lower at the level of statistical significance in the PVB group compared to controls at 2 and 4 h post-surgery. At 6 and 8 h post-surgery, the control group had a lower VAS score when moving, and this result reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). The controls used more opioid relief than the PVB group and had lower scores for satisfaction (p < 0.05). Conclusion Ultrasound-guided PVB using bupivacaine and an in-plane technique provides effective analgesia in PNL. It is associated with high scores on patient satisfaction and minimal complications. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04406012. Registered retrospectively, on 27 May 2020.
32993507/Sevoflurane modulates breast cancer cell survival via modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis Background Some retrospective and in vitro studies suggest that general anesthetics influence breast cancer recurrence and metastasis. We compared the effects of general anesthetics sevoflurane versus propofol on breast cancer cell survival, proliferation and invasion in vitro. The investigation focused on effects in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis as a mechanism for general anesthetic-mediated effects on breast cancer cell survival and metastasis. Methods Estrogen receptor-positive (MCF7) and estrogen receptor-negative (MDA-MB-436) human breast cancer cell lines along with normal breast tissue (MCF10A) were used. Cells were exposed to sevoflurane or propofol at clinically relevant and extreme doses and durations for dose- and time-dependence studies. Cell survival, proliferation and migration following anesthetic exposure were assessed. Intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations were modulated using Ca2+ chelation and a TRPV1 Ca2+ channel antagonist to examine the role of Ca2+ in mediating anesthetic effects. Results Sevoflurane affected breast cancer cell survival in dose-, time- and cell type-dependent manners. Sevoflurane, but not propofol, at equipotent and clinically relevant doses (2% vs. 2 muM) for 6 h significantly promoted breast cell survival in all three types of cells. Paradoxically, extreme exposure to sevoflurane (4%, 24 h) decreased survival in all three cell lines. Chelation of cytosolic Ca2+ dramatically decreased cell survival in both breast cancer lines but not control cells. Inhibition of TRPV1 receptors significantly reduced cell survival in all cell types, an effect that was partially reversed by equipotent sevoflurane but not propofol. Six-hour exposure to sevoflurane or propofol did not affect cell proliferation, metastasis or TRPV1 protein expression in any type of cell. Conclusion Sevoflurane, but not propofol, at clinically relevant concentrations and durations, increased survival of breast cancer cells in vitro but had no effect on cell proliferation, migration or TRPV1 expression. Breast cancer cells require higher cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels for survival than normal breast tissue. Sevoflurane affects breast cancer cell survival via modulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.
32679610/Exosomal miR-1255b-5p targets human telomerase reverse transcriptase in colorectal cancer cells to suppress epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Cancer cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to hypoxia. Tumor-derived exosomes carry microRNAs (miRNA) that affect metastasis and EMT. We identified a targeting relationship between tumor-derived exosomal miR-1255b-5p and human telomerase reverse transcriptase in association with EMT and telomerase stability. We propose miRNA-targeted regulation of telomerase as a promising strategy for CRC treatment.  Cancer cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to hypoxia. Exosomes produced in tumor microenvironments carry microRNAs (miRNAs) that affect proliferation, metastasis, and EMT. Hypoxic regulation of EMT is associated with telomerase content and stability, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We identified a targeting relationship between tumor-suppressing miR-1255b-5p and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) via clinical screening of serum samples in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. EMT suppression via exosomal miR-1255b-5p delivery was investigated by assessing hTERT expression, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and telomerase activity. We revealed that hypoxia directly affected exosomal miR-1255b-5p content, the delivery of which between CRC cells significantly impacted cell invasion, EMT-related protein expression, and telomerase stability. Specifically, miR-1255b-5p suppressed EMT by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin activation via hTERT inhibition. Hypoxia reduced exosomal miR-1255b-5p secretion by CRC cells, thereby increasing hTERT expression to enhance EMT and telomerase activity. In a mouse CRC model, hypoxic exosomes containing overexpressed miR-1255b-5p attenuated EMT, tumor progression, and liver metastasis. Our results suggest the antitumor role of miR-1255b-5p and its involvement in the regulation of hTERT-mediated EMT. We propose that miRNA-targeted regulation of telomerase is a promising therapeutic strategy for future CRC treatment.
32734688/Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer Ralaniten and analogs (EPI) bind androgen receptor N-terminal domain (AR-NTD) to block the transcriptional activities of full-length AR (FL-AR) and AR splice variants (AR-Vs). Enzalutamide (ENZ) elevates levels of AR-V7 leading to resistance and increased proliferation. Targeting AR-NTD to block FL-AR and AR-Vs with EPI in combination with ENZ resulted in synergistic inhibition of proliferation of ENZ-resistant prostate cancer cells.  Resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to enzalutamide and abiraterone involves the expression of constitutively active, truncated androgen receptor (AR) splice variants (AR-Vs) that lack a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Both full-length AR and truncated AR-Vs require a functional N-terminal domain (NTD) for transcriptional activity thereby providing rationale for the development of ralaniten (EPI-002) as a first-in-class antagonist of the AR-NTD. Here, we evaluated the antitumor effect of a next-generation analog of ralaniten (EPI-7170) as a monotherapy or in combination with enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells that express AR-V7 that were resistant to enzalutamide. EPI-7170 had 8-9 times improved potency compared to ralaniten. Enzalutamide increased levels of AR-V7 and expression of its target genes. Knockdown of AR-V7 restored sensitivity to enzalutamide, indicating a role for AR-V7 in the mechanism of resistance. EPI-7170 inhibited expression of genes transcriptionally regulated by full-length AR and AR-V7. A combination of EPI-7170 and enzalutamide resulted in synergistic inhibition of proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant cells that was consistent with results from cell cycle and clonogenic assays. In addition, this drug enhanced the antitumor effect of enzalutamide in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC preclinical models. Thus, a combination therapy targeting both the NTD and LBD of AR, and thereby blocking both full-length AR and AR-Vs, has potential for the treatment of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC.
32652830/Clearance of therapy-induced senescent tumor cells by the senolytic ABT-263 via interference with BCL-XL-BAX interaction Senescent tumor cells can be selectively eliminated by the BH3 mimetic, ABT-263 (navitoclax), via senolysis. We show that ABT-263 inhibits the interaction between anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, BCL-XL, and pro-apoptotic effector, BAX. This results in senescent tumor cell death in vitro and reduced tumor volume in vivo. This work highlights the utilization of senolytic agents to enhance efficacy of anticancer therapy.  Tumor cells undergo senescence in response to both conventional and targeted cancer therapies. The induction of senescence in response to cancer therapy can contribute to unfavorable patient outcomes, potentially including disease relapse. This possibiliy is supported by our findings that tumor cells induced into senescence by doxorubicin or etoposide can give rise to viable tumors in vivo. We further demonstrate sensitivity of these senescent tumor cells to the senolytic ABT-263 (navitoclax), therefore providing a "two-hit" approach to eliminate senescent tumor cells that persist after exposure to chemotherapy or radiation. The sequential combination of therapy-induced senescence and ABT-263 could shift the response to therapy toward apoptosis by interfering with the interaction between BCL-XL and BAX. The administration of ABT-263 after either etoposide or doxorubicin also resulted in marked, prolonged tumor suppression in tumor-bearing animals. These findings support the premise that senolytic therapy following conventional cancer therapy may improve therapeutic outcomes and delay disease recurrence.
32412676/Long non-coding RNA PGM5-AS1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells by impairing miR-140-5p-mediated FBN1 inhibition Osteosarcoma is an uncommon tumor occurring in bone, accompanied by elevated incidence and reduced rate of healing. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) serves as a conceptual paradigm to explain the invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma and other cancers. Hence, developing effective therapeutic strategy to treat the EMT of osteosarcoma is essential. Here, we identified the molecular mechanism of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PGM5-AS1 in EMT and progression of osteosarcoma. Microarray-based analysis was employed to screen the osteosarcoma-related differentially expressed lncRNAs. The levels of PGM5-AS1 as well as microRNA-140-5p (miR-140-5p) and fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in osteosarcoma tissues and cells were determined. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA pull-down assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted to validate the relationship among PGM5-AS1, miR-140-5p, and FBN1. Expression of PGM5-AS1, miR-140-5p, and FBN1 was altered by overexpression, shRNA, mimic, or inhibitors in order to investigate how they regulated migration, invasion, and EMT of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches were employed in nude mice to detect their roles in tumorigenesis in vivo. Osteosarcoma tissues and cells exhibited low expression of miR-140-5p, but high expression of PGM5-AS1 and FBN1. PGM5-AS1 competitively bound to miR-140-5p to upregulate FBN1. Furthermore, hindering PGM5-AS1 and FBN1 or overexpressing miR-140-5p dampened migration, invasion, and EMT of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, silencing PGM5-AS1 or FBN1, or overexpressing miR-140-5p markedly inhibited tumorigenesis in nude mice in vivo. Taken together, PGM5-AS1 depletion causes FBN1 reduction to retard osteosarcoma processes by negatively modulating miR-140-5p. In this study, we analyzed the modulatory role of PGM5-AS1 in the progression and EMT of osteosarcoma. In osteosarcoma tissues and cells, PGM5-AS1 and FBN1 are highly expressed, while miR-140-5p exhibits low expression. We reveal that PGM5-AS1 specifically binds to miR-140-5p to silence the expression of FBN1, and thereby attenuate EMT, invasion, and migration of osteosarcoma in vitro as well as tumorigenesis in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the modulatory role of PGM5-AS1 in the progression and EMT of osteosarcoma. In osteosarcoma tissues and cells, PGM5-AS1 and FBN1 are highly expressed, while miR-140-5p exhibits low expression. We reveal that PGM5-AS1 specifically binds to miR-140-5p to silence the expression of FBN1, and thereby attenuate EMT, invasion, and migration of osteosarcoma in vitro as well as tumorigenesis in vivo. 
32533903/ TERT C228T mutation in non-malignant bladder urothelium is associated with intravesical recurrence for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations are frequently found in tumors or urine from patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC). TERT promoter mutations are also detected in urine from patients with no evidence of cancer but are associated with subsequent UC development. Mutations in the TERT promoter are thought to be present in nonmalignant urothelium (NMU) during early stages of tumor formation prior to pathological change, but this has not been proven directly. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated the clinical utility of TERT promoter mutation analysis in NMU of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This single-institute study included 53 primary tumors and 428 systematic bladder biopsy specimens from 54 patients with NMIBC. All patients underwent systematic random biopsy and transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. Genomic DNA was analyzed for TERT C228T and C250T mutations using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The association between TERT promoter mutation of NMU and bladder recurrence was examined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 54 patients, 16 (29.6%) had a TERT C228T mutation and three (5.6%) had a TERT C250T mutation in NMU. Of 428 biopsy specimens, the TERT C228T mutation was detected in 9% (31/364) of normal urothelium, 27% (4/15) of urothelial dysplasia (UD), 50% (9/18) of UD suspicious for carcinoma in situ (CIS), and 58% (18/31) of CIS. During follow-up (median: 3.7 years), 22 (40.7%) patients experienced bladder recurrence and five (9.3%) experienced disease progression. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that TERT C228T mutation in NMU was significantly associated with bladder recurrence after adjustment for cofounding factors (P = 0.0128). Thus, TERT C228T mutation was detected in NMU, which was a reliable independent prognostic factor of bladder tumor recurrence. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) C228T mutation was detected in normal urothelium and urothelial dysplasia of patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and may thus be a novel and useful prognostic factor for risk stratification of NMIBC. Analysis of systematic random biopsies for TERT promoter mutations in nonmalignant urothelium may guide selection of the optimal treatment strategy. 
32623836/The BCL-2 family protein inhibitor ABT-737 as an additional tool for the treatment of EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders Tumor cells infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) express latency proteins, among which LMP1 is able to increase the level of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, today considered as an attractive target for therapeutic strategies. Our results suggest that agents targeting BCL-2, used either alone or in combination with rituximab, represent a novel promising approach for post-transplant EBV-positive B lymphoproliferative disorder treatment.  Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) are B-cell malignancies strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In these lymphoproliferative disorders, EBV infection induces an increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. Given its chemoprotective effect, BCL-2 constitutes an attractive target for new therapeutic strategies for EBV-positive B-cell malignancies. Here, we show that ABT-737, a small inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-X(L), and BCL-w, strongly induced apoptosis in vitro in EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (which is a model for PTLD), whereas BL was less sensitive. ABT-737 reduced tumor growth and increased the overall survival of mice in a xenograft model of PTLD but had no effect on BL xenograft mice. ABT-737 combined with a low dose of cyclophosphamide, a major component of the conventional CHOP chemotherapy regimen for BL patients, reduced tumor growth during treatment but failed to improve the overall survival of BL xenograft mice. By contrast, the combination of ABT-737 and rituximab, one of the main options for the treatment of PTLD, was highly efficient and induced approximately 70% remission in PTLD xenograft mice. These results suggest that the use of agents targeting BCL-2, either alone or in combination with other conventional drugs, represents a novel promising approach for post-transplant EBV-positive B lymphoproliferative disorders.
32579780/The CHK1 inhibitor MU380 significantly increases the sensitivity of human docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to gemcitabine through the induction of mitotic catastrophe As treatment options for patients with incurable metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are considerably limited, novel effective therapeutic options are needed. Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a highly conserved protein kinase implicated in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway that prevents the accumulation of DNA damage and controls regular genome duplication. CHK1 has been associated with prostate cancer (PCa) induction, progression, and lethality; hence, CHK1 inhibitors SCH900776 (also known as MK-8776) and the more effective SCH900776 analog MU380 may have clinical applications in the therapy of PCa. Synergistic induction of DNA damage with CHK1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach that has been tested in many types of malignancies, but not in chemoresistant mCRPC. Here, we report that such therapeutic approach may be exploited using the synergistic action of the antimetabolite gemcitabine (GEM) and CHK1 inhibitors SCH900776 and MU380 in docetaxel-resistant (DR) mCRPC. Given the results, both CHK1 inhibitors significantly potentiated the sensitivity to GEM in a panel of chemo-naive and matched DR PCa cell lines under 2D conditions. MU380 exhibited a stronger synergistic effect with GEM than clinical candidate SCH900776. MU380 alone or in combination with GEM significantly reduced spheroid size and increased apoptosis in all patient-derived xenograft 3D cultures, with a higher impact in DR models. Combined treatment induced premature mitosis from G1 phase resulting in the mitotic catastrophe as a prestage of apoptosis. Finally, treatment by MU380 alone, or in combination with GEM, significantly inhibited tumor growth of both PC339-DOC and PC346C-DOC xenograft models in mice. Taken together, our data suggest that metabolically robust and selective CHK1 inhibitor MU380 can bypass docetaxel resistance and improve the effectiveness of GEM in DR mCRPC models. This approach might allow for dose reduction of GEM and thereby minimize undesired toxicity and may represent a therapeutic option for patients with incurable DR mCRPC. As the treatment options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are limited, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Here, we showed that checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor MU380 significantly potentiates gemcitabine cytotoxicity in docetaxel-resistant mCRPC models, resulting in mitotic catastrophe. These data provide a preclinical rationale for the application of MU380 in a clinical setting for the therapy of mCRPC. 
33008474/The prevalence and mechanism of triclosan resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from urine samples in Wenzhou, China Background The widespread application of triclosan contributes to its residual deposition in urine, which provides an environment of long-term exposure to triclosan for the intestinal Escherichia coli. We determined the triclosan and antibiotic resistance characteristics of E. coli strains isolated from urine samples and further investigated the resistance mechanism and molecular epidemic characteristics of triclosan-resistant E. coli isolates. Methods A total of 200 non-repetitive E. coli strains were isolated from urine samples and then identified. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of triclosan and antibiotics, fabI mutation, efflux pump activity, the expression of 14 efflux pump encoding genes, and epidemiological characteristics were determined by the agar dilution method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) inhibition test, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for all triclosan-resistant isolates. Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of triclosan exposure in vitro on antibiotic susceptibility and the efflux pump encoding gene expressions of triclosan-susceptible strains via serial passage experiments. Results Of the 200 E. coli isolates, 2.5% (n = 5) were found to be resistant to triclosan, and multidrug resistance (MDR) and cross-resistance phenotypes were noted for these triclosan-resistant strains. The triclosan-sensitive strains also exhibited MDR phenotypes, probably because of the high resistance rate to AMP, CIP, LVX, and GEN. Gly79Ala and Ala69Thr amino acid changes were observed in the triclosan-resistant strains, but these changes may not mediate resistance of E. coli to triclosan, because mutations of these two amino acids has also been detected in triclosan-susceptible strains. Moreover, except for DC8603, all other strains enhanced the efflux pumps activity. As compared with ATCC 25922, except for fabI, increased expressions were noted for all efflux pump encoding genes such as ydcV, ydcU, ydcS, ydcT, cysP, yihV, acrB, acrD, and mdfA among the studied strains with varying PFGE patterns and STs types. Unexpectedly, 5 susceptible E. coli isolates showed rapidly increasing triclosan resistance after exposure to triclosan in vitro for only 12 days, while MDR or cross-resistance phenotypes and the overexpression of efflux pump genes were recorded among these triclosan-induced resistant isolates. Conclusions This is the first study to report that short-term triclosan exposure in vitro increases triclosan resistance in susceptible E. coli isolates. After acquiring resistance, these strains may present MDR or cross-resistance phenotypes. Moreover, triclosan resistance mainly involves the overexpression of fabI and efflux pumps in E. coli isolates.
33023493/The effects of exopolysaccharides and exopolysaccharide-producing Lactobacillus on the intestinal microbiome of zebrafish (Danio rerio) Background Numerous studies have reported the health-promoting effects of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) in in vitro models; however, a functional evaluation of EPSs will provide additional knowledge of EPS-microbe interactions by in vivo intestinal microbial model. In the present study, high-throughput amplicon sequencing, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) and intestinal inflammation evaluation were performed to explore the potential benefits of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and EPS-producing Lactobacillus (HNUB20 group) using the healthy zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Results The results based on microbial taxonomic analysis revealed that the abundance of four genera, Ochrobactrum, Sediminibacterium, Sphingomonas and Sphingobium, were increased in the control group in comparison to HNUB20 group. Pelomonas spp. levels were significantly higher and that of the genera Lactobacillus and Brachybacterium were significantly decreased in EPS group compared with control group. PICRUSt based functional prediction of gut microbiota metabolic pathways indicated that significantly lower abundance was found for transcription, and membrane transport, whereas folding, sorting and degradation and energy metabolism had significantly higher abundance after HNUB20 treatment. Two metabolic pathways, including metabolism and endocrine functions, were more abundant in the EPS group than control group. Similar to the HNUB20 group, transcription was also decreased in the EPS group compared with the control group. However, SCFAs and immune indexes indicated EPS and HNUB20 performed limited efficacy in the healthy zebrafish. Conclusions The present intestinal microbial model-based study indicated that EPSs and high-yield EPS-producing Lactobacillus can shake the structure of intestinal microbiota, but cannot change SCFAs presence and intestinal inflammation.
33028197/Improved haemodynamic stability and cerebral tissue oxygenation after induction of anaesthesia with sufentanil compared to remifentanil: a randomised controlled trial Background Balanced anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, compared to sufentanil, often decreases mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and cardiac index (CI), raising concerns on tissue-oxygenation. This distinct haemodynamic suppression might be attenuated by atropine. This double blinded RCT, investigates if induction with propofol-sufentanil results in higher CI and tissue-oxygenation than with propofol-remifentanil and if atropine has more pronounced beneficial effects on CI and tissue-oxygenation in a remifentanil-based anaesthesia. Methods In seventy patients scheduled for coronary bypass grafting (CABG), anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol target controlled infusion (TCI) with a target effect-site concentration (Cet) of 2.0 mug ml- 1 and either sufentanil (TCI Cet 0.48 ng ml- 1) or remifentanil (TCI Cet 8 ng ml- 1). If HR dropped below 60 bpm, methylatropine (1 mg) was administered intravenously. Relative changes  in MAP, HR, stroke volume (SV), CI and cerebral (SctO2) and peripheral (SptO2) tissue-oxygenation during induction of anaesthesia and after atropine administration were analysed. Results The sufentanil group compared to the remifentanil group showed significantly less decrease in MAP (  = - 23 +- 13 vs. -36 +- 13 mmHg), HR (  = - 5 +- 7 vs. -10 +- 10 bpm), SV (  = - 23 +- 18 vs. -35 +- 19 ml) and CI (  = - 0.8 (- 1.5 to - 0.5) vs. -1.5 (- 2.0 to - 1.1) l min- 1 m- 2), while SctO2 (  = 9 +- 5 vs. 6 +- 4%) showed more increase with no difference in  SptO2 (  = 8 +- 7 vs. 8 +- 8%). Atropine caused higher  HR (13 (9 to 19) vs. 10 +- 6 bpm) and  CI (0.4 +- 0.4 vs. 0.2 +- 0.3 l min- 1 m- 2) in sufentanil vs. remifentanil-based anaesthesia, with no difference in  MAP,  SV and  SctO2 and  SptO2. Conclusion Induction of anaesthesia with propofol and sufentanil results in improved haemodynamic stability and higher SctO2 compared to propofol and remifentanil in patients having CABG. Administration of atropine might be useful to counteract or prevent the haemodynamic suppression associated with these opioids.

33036554/Continuous block at the proximal end of the adductor canal provides better analgesia compared to that at the middle of the canal after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial Background The optimal position for continuous adductor canal block (ACB) for analgesia after total knee anthroplasty (TKA) remians controversial, mainly due to high variability in the localization of the the adductor canal (AC). Latest neuroanatomy studies show that the nerve to vastus medialis plays an important role in innervating the anteromedial aspect of the knee and dives outside of the exact AC at the proximal end of the AC. Therefore, we hypothesized that continuous ACB at the proximal end of the exact AC could provide a better analgesic effect after TKA compared with that at the middle of the AC (which appeared to only block the saphenous nerve). Methods Sixty-two adult patients who were scheduled for a unilateral TKA were randomized to receive continuous ACB at the proximal end or middle of the AC. All patients received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with sufentanil postoperatively. The primary outcome measure was cumulative sufentanil consumption within 24 h after the surgery, which was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. P-values < 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant. The secondary outcomes included postoperative sufentanil consumption at other time points, pain at rest and during passive knee flexion, quadriceps motor strength, and other recovery related paramaters. Results Sixty patients eventually completed the study (30/group). The 24-h sufentanil consumption was 0.22 mug/kg (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.15-0.40 mug/kg) and 0.39 mug/kg (IQR: 0.23-0.52 mug/kg) in the proximal end and middle groups (P = 0.026), respectively. There were no significant inter-group differences in sufentanil consumption at other time points, pain at rest and during passive knee flexion, quadriceps motor strength, and other recovery related paramaters. Conclusions Continuous ACB at the proximal end of the AC has a better opioid-sparing effect without a significant influence on quadriceps motor strength compared to that at the middle of the AC after TKA. These findings indicates that a true ACB may not produce the effective analgesia, instead, the proximal end AC might be a more suitable block to alleviate pain after TKA. Trial registration This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03942133; registration date: May 06, 2019; enrollment date: May 11, 2019).
33046006/The combined usage of Matrine and Osthole inhibited endoplasmic reticulum apoptosis induced by PCV2 Background Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an important and common DNA virus that infect pig and can cause immunosuppression and induce apoptosis in the infected cells. To escape the host immune system, PCV2 constantly builds up complex mechanisms or mutates genes, and that is why it is difficult to eradicate complex PCV2 infection by relying on vaccines and single compound. At present, there is few literature reports on the effective prevention and treatment of PCV2 infection by a combination of two or more compounds. Previously, we have demonstrated the anti-PCV2 effect of Matrine in vitro, but its mechanism has not been further evaluated. Literatures have proven that Osthole has a variety of pharmacological activities, and we tested the ability of Osthole to inhibit PCV2 replication in cell culture. Therefore, this study explored the synergistic antiviral effect of Matrine combined with Osthole and their synergistic anti-apoptotic mechanism. Results Osthole alone had an anti-PCV2 effect, and then its synergistic anti-PCV2 effect of Osthole and Matrine was better than that of Matrine or Osthole alone as demonstrated by qRT-PCR, IFA and Western blotting results. The anti-apoptotic mechanism of these two compounds by inducing the PERK pathway by PCV2 was elucidated through Annexin V-FITC/PI, JC-1 and Western blotting. Matrine and Osthole combination could inhibit the expression of Cap in Cap-transfected PK-15 cells, thus inhibiting Cap-induced PERK apoptosis. Ribavirin was used as a positive control. Conclusions The combination of Osthole and Matrine had the synergistic effect of anti-PCV2 infection by directly inhibiting the expression of PCV2 Cap protein. The combination of these two compounds also inhibited PERK apoptosis induced by PCV2 Cap protein, possibly by regulating the level of GRP78. The results formed a base for further studies on the mechanism of anti-PCV2 in vivo using Matrine and Osthole combination and developing new anti-PCV2 compounds with Cap and GRP78 as therapeutic targets.
33046008/Exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) promote changes in growth, phospholipid composition, membrane permeability and virulence phenotypes in Escherichia coli Background The utilization of exogenous fatty acids by Gram-negative bacteria has been linked to many cellular processes, including fatty acid oxidation for metabolic gain, assimilation into membrane phospholipids, and control of phenotypes associated with virulence. The expanded fatty acid handling capabilities have been demonstrated in several bacteria of medical importance; however, a survey of the polyunsaturated fatty acid responses in the model organism Escherichia coli has not been performed. The current study examined the impacts of exogenous fatty acids on E. coli. Results All PUFAs elicited higher overall growth, with several fatty acids supporting growth as sole carbon sources. Most PUFAs were incorporated into membrane phospholipids as determined by Ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, whereas membrane permeability was variably affected as measured by two separate dye uptake assays. Biofilm formation, swimming motility and antimicrobial peptide resistance were altered in the presence of PUFAs, with arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids eliciting strong alteration to these phenotypes. Conclusions The findings herein add E. coli to the growing list of Gram-negative bacteria with broader capabilities for utilizing and responding to exogenous fatty acids. Understanding bacterial responses to PUFAs may lead to microbial behavioral control regimens for disease prevention.
33054711/Assessment and molecular characterization of Bacillus cereus isolated from edible fungi in China Background Bacillus cereus is a foodborne pathogen commonly found in nature and food and can cause food spoilage and health issues. Although the prevalence of B. cereus in foods has been reported worldwide, the extent of contamination in edible fungi, which has become increasingly popular as traditional or functional food, is largely unknown. Here we investigated the prevalence, toxin genes' distribution, antibiotic resistance, and genetic diversity of B. cereus isolated from edible fungi in China. Results Six hundred and ninety-nine edible fungi samples were collected across China, with 198 (28.3%) samples found to be contaminated by B. cereus, with an average contamination level of 55.4 most probable number (MPN)/g. Two hundred and forty-seven B. cereus strains were isolated from the contaminated samples. Seven enterotoxin genes and one cereulide synthetase gene were detected. The detection frequencies of all enterotoxin genes were >= 80%, whereas the positive rate of the cesB gene in B. cereus was 3%. Most isolates were resistant to penicillins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephems, and ansamycins, but were susceptible to penems, aminoglycosides, macrolides, ketolide, glycopeptides, quinolones, phenylpropanol, tetracyclines, lincosamides, streptogramins, and nitrofurans. Meanwhile, 99.6% of all isolates displayed multiple antimicrobial resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials. Using genetic diversity analysis, all isolates were defined in 171 sequence types (STs), of which 83 isolates were assigned to 78 new STs. Conclusions This study provides large-scale insight into the prevalence and potential risk of B. cereus in edible fungi in China. Approximately one-third of the samples were contaminated with B. cereus, and almost all isolates showed multiple antimicrobial resistance. Detection frequencies of all seven enterotoxin genes were equal to or more than 80%. These new findings may indicate a need for proper pre-/post-processing of edible fungi to eliminate B. cereus, thereby preventing the potential risk to public health.
33082717/Phenolic Content and Antioxidant, Antihyperlipidemic, and Antidiabetogenic Effects of Opuntia dillenii Seed Oil  Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gawl.) Haw. is a medicinal plant that is widely used by the Moroccan population to treat many diseases, thanks to its richness in bioactive molecules. This study aims to evaluate the total phenolic content and antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, and antidiabetogenic activities of O. dillenii seeds oil (ODSO), in vivo. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay and the Folin-Ciocalteu method were applied in this study to determine antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of ODSO, respectively. The antihyperlipidemic effect of the ODSO (2 ml/kg) was evaluated in the high-fat diet-fed albino mice, relying on lipid profile, blood glucose, and growth performance variations. Moreover, the preventive effect of ODSO was evaluated against alloxan monohydrate-induced diabetes in albino mice. ODSO had the highest total phenolic content (518.18 +- 14.36 mg EAC/kg) and DPPH scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.38 +- 0.08 mg/mL). Furthermore, ODSO showed a significant antidiabetogenic effect by reducing bodyweight loss, blood sugar level rise, and mortality rate caused by alloxan in albino mice. Then, ODSO has exhibited a significant antihyperlipidemic effect by improving the lipid profile disorder and glucose level rise in the blood, produced by the high-fat diet-fed albino mice. Results suggest that antidiabetogenic and antihyperlipidemic activities of ODSO correlate to the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of this oil. Hence, this plant could be a significant source of medically important critical compounds.
33054754/PhoPQ two-component regulatory system plays a global regulatory role in antibiotic susceptibility, physiology, stress adaptation, and virulence in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Background Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an opportunistic pathogen, is ubiquitously present in various environments, signifying its high capability of environmental adaptation. Two-component regulatory system (TCS) is a powerful implement to help organisms to survive in different environments. In clinic, treatment of S. maltophilia infection is difficult because it is naturally resistant to many antibiotics, highlighting the necessity to develop novel drugs or adjuvants. Given their critical and extensively regulatory role, TCS system has been proposed as a convincing target for novel drugs or adjuvants. PhoPQ TCS, a highly conserved TCS in several pathogens, plays crucial roles in low-magnesium adaption, polymyxin resistance, and virulence. In this study, we aimed to characterize the role of PhoPQ TCS of S. maltophilia in antibiotic susceptibility, physiology, stress adaptation, and virulence. Results To characterize PhoPQ system, phoP single mutant as well as phoP and phoQ double mutant were constructed. Distinct from most phoPQ systems of other microorganisms, two features were observed during the construction of phoP and phoQ single deletion mutant. Firstly, the phoQ mutant was not successfully obtained. Secondly, the compromised phenotypes of phoP mutant were not reverted by complementing an intact phoP gene, but were partially restored by complementing a phoPQ operon. Thus, wild-type KJ, phoP mutant (KJDeltaPhoP), phoPQ mutant (KJDeltaPhoPQ), and complemented strain (KJDeltaPhoPQ (pPhoPQ)) were used for functional assays, including antibiotic susceptibility, physiology (swimming motility and secreted protease activity), stress adaptation (oxidative, envelope, and iron-depletion stresses), and virulence to Caenorhabditis elegans. KJDeltaPhoPQ totally lost swimming motility, had enhanced secreted protease activity, increased susceptibility to antibiotics (beta-lactam, quinolone, aminoglycoside, macrolide, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim), menadione, H2O2, SDS, and 2,2'-dipyridyl, as well as attenuated virulence to C. elegans. Trans-complementation of KJDeltaPhoPQ with phoPQ reverted these altered phenotypes to the wild-type levels. Conclusions Given the critical and global roles of PhoPQ TCS in antibiotic susceptibility, physiology, stress adaptation, and virulence, PhoPQ is a potential target for the design of drugs or adjuvants.
32867265/Enzymatic Regulation and Biological Functions of Reactive Cysteine Persulfides and Polysulfides Cysteine persulfide (CysSSH) and cysteine polysulfides (CysSSnH, n > 1) are cysteine derivatives that have sulfane sulfur atoms bound to cysteine thiol. Advances in analytical methods that detect and quantify persulfides and polysulfides have shown that CysSSH and related species such as glutathione persulfide occur physiologically and are prevalent in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and mammals in vivo. The chemical properties and abundance of these compounds suggest a central role for reactive persulfides in cell-regulatory processes. CysSSH and related species have been suggested to act as powerful antioxidants and cellular protectants and may serve as redox signaling intermediates. It was recently shown that cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) is a new cysteine persulfide synthase. In addition, we discovered that CARS is involved in protein polysulfidation that is coupled with translation. Mitochondrial activity in biogenesis and bioenergetics is supported and upregulated by CysSSH derived from mitochondrial CARS. In this review article, we discuss the mechanisms of the biosynthesis of CysSSH and related persulfide species, with a particular focus on the roles of CARS. We also review the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory actions of persulfides.
32825716/Foliar Spray of Fe-Asp Confers Better Drought Tolerance in Sunflower as Compared with FeSO4: Yield Traits, Osmotic Adjustment, and Antioxidative Defense Mechanisms Different techniques are being employed to reduce the adverse effects of water stress on seed yield and quality of crop plants. The current study aimed to improve the water stress tolerance of field-grown sunflower by foliar-supplied ecofriendly iron-chelated aspartate (Fe-Asp) in comparison with FeSO4. Water stress decreased the plant growth and yield, accompanied with disturbed water relations, nutrient acquisition, accumulation of amino acids, and antioxidative defense mechanisms. However, lipid peroxidation, total anthocyanin, and photosynthetic pigments were increased. Fertigation of FeSO4 and Fe-Asp as foliar sprays proved effective to reduce the negativities of limited irrigation on biomass production and seed yield, accompanied with a reduction in lipid peroxidation and improvements in water relations, antioxidative defense mechanisms, and leaf photosynthetic pigments. In comparison with FeSO4, foliary applied Fe-Asp better improved the plant water relations with more accumulation of essential amino acids and nutrient acquisition, especially leaf aspartate (Asp) and Fe accumulation which showed better translocation. Overall, foliary applied Fe-Asp proved better for induction of drought tolerance in sunflower plants as compared with FeSO4. The study recommended the use of the ecofriendly Fe-Asp as a foliar spray for better growth and production of sunflower under limited irrigation.
32961761/5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) Positively Regulates Pigmentation via Inducing Melanoblast Specification and Melanin Synthesis in Zebrafish Embryos It has been reported that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is related to melanogenesis in mice and melanoma cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of 5-HT in regulating pigmentation remains unknown. In this study, we aim to clarify the regulatory mechanism of 5-HT in the pigmentation of zebrafish embryos and B16F10 cells. Our results show that 5-HT induces the pigmentation of zebrafish embryos in a dosage-dependent manner at concentrations of 0.01-1 mM. Whole mount in situ hybridizations and qRT-PCR in zebrafish embryos indicate that the expression of neural crest cells marker gene sox10 is not changed in embryos treated with 5-HT compared to control group. The expression of mitfa, the marker gene of melanoblasts, is increased in the presence of 5-HT. Furthermore, 5-HT increased the expression of regeneration associated genes, namely kita, mitfa, and dct, after ablation of the melanogenic cells in zebrafish embryos. The experiments in B16F10 cells show that 5-HT promotes melanin synthesis by up-regulating the expression of key proteins MITF, TYR, TRP-1, and TRP-2. Especially, the small molecule inhibitor of PKA signaling, but not AKT and MAPK signaling, attenuates the up-regulation of MITF and TYR resulted from 5-HT induction in B16F10 cells. These results will help us to further understand the regulatory network of vertebrate pigmentation.
32846891/Gene Expression Analysis of Astrocyte and Microglia Endocannabinoid Signaling during Autoimmune Demyelination The endocannabinoid system is associated with protective effects in multiple sclerosis (MS) that involve attenuated innate immune cell responses. Astrocytes and microglia are modulated by endocannabinoids and participate in the biosynthesis and metabolism of these compounds. However, the role of neuroglial cells as targets and mediators of endocannabinoid signaling in MS is poorly understood. Here we used a microfluidic RT-qPCR screen to assess changes in the expression of the main endocannabinoid signaling genes in astrocytes and microglia purified from female mice during the time-course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that astrocytes and microglia upregulate the expression of genes encoding neurotoxic A1 and pro-inflammatory molecules at the acute disease with many of these transcripts remaining elevated during the recovery phase. Both cell populations exhibited an early onset decrease in the gene expression levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) hydrolytic enzymes that persisted during EAE progression as well as cell-type-specific changes in the transcript levels for genes encoding cannabinoid receptors and molecules involved in anandamide (AEA) signaling. Our results demonstrate that astrocytes and microglia responses to autoimmune demyelination involve alterations in the expression of multiple endocannabinoid signaling-associated genes and suggest that this system may regulate the induction of neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs in both cell types during MS.
32872194/Simultaneous Blockade of Histamine H3 Receptors and Inhibition of Acetylcholine Esterase Alleviate Autistic-Like Behaviors in BTBR T+ tf/J Mouse Model of Autism Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder defined by persistent deficits in social interaction and the presence of patterns of repetitive and restricted behaviors. The central neurotransmitters histamine (HA) and acetylcholine (ACh) play pleiotropic roles in physiological brain functions that include the maintenance of wakefulness, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, anxiety and narcolepsy, all of which are found to be comorbid with ASD. Therefore, the palliative effects of subchronic systemic treatment using the multiple-active test compound E100 with high H3R antagonist affinity and AChE inhibitory effect on ASD-like behaviors in male BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice as an idiopathic ASD model were assessed. E100 (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently palliated social deficits of BTBR mice and significantly alleviated the repetitive/compulsive behaviors of tested animals. Moreover, E100 modulated disturbed anxiety levels, but failed to modulate hyperactivity parameters, whereas the reference AChE inhibitor donepezil (DOZ, one milligram per kilogram) significantly obliterated the increased hyperactivity measures of tested mice. Furthermore, E100 mitigated the increased levels of AChE activity in BTBR mice with observed effects comparable to that of DOZ and significantly reduced the number of activated microglial cells compared to the saline-treated BTBR mice. In addition, the E100-provided effects on ASD-like parameters, AChE activity, and activated microglial cells were entirely reversed by co-administration of the H3R agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAM). These initial overall results observed in an idiopathic ASD mice model show that E100 (5 mg/kg) alleviated the assessed behavioral deficits and demonstrate that simultaneous targeting of brain histaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmissions is crucial for palliation of ASD-like features, albeit further in vivo assessments on its effects on brain levels of ACh as well as HA are still needed.
32962296/Lipophilic Cations Rescue the Growth of Yeast under the Conditions of Glycolysis Overflow Chemicals inducing a mild decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio are considered as caloric restriction mimetics as well as treatments against obesity. Screening for such chemicals in animal model systems requires a lot of time and labor. Here, we present a system for the rapid screening of non-toxic substances causing such a de-energization of cells. We looked for chemicals allowing the growth of yeast lacking trehalose phosphate synthase on a non-fermentable carbon source in the presence of glucose. Under such conditions, the cells cannot grow because the cellular phosphate is mostly being used to phosphorylate the sugars in upper glycolysis, while the biosynthesis of bisphosphoglycerate is blocked. We reasoned that by decreasing the ATP/ADP ratio, one might prevent the phosphorylation of the sugars and also boost bisphosphoglycerate synthesis by providing the substrate, i.e., inorganic phosphate. We confirmed that a complete inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation alleviates the block. As our system includes a non-fermentable carbon source, only the chemicals that did not cause a complete block of mitochondrial ATP synthesis allowed the initial depletion of glucose followed by respiratory growth. Using this system, we found two novel compounds, dodecylmethyl diphenylamine (FS1) and diethyl (tetradecyl) phenyl ammonium bromide (Kor105), which possess a mild membrane-depolarizing activity.
32824918/Lipid Modulation in the Formation of beta-Sheet Structures. Implications for De Novo Design of Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide and the Impact on beta-Cell Homeostasis Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) corresponds to a 37-residue hormone present in insulin granules that maintains a high propensity to form beta-sheet structures during co-secretion with insulin. Previously, employing a biomimetic approach, we proposed a panel of optimized IAPP sequences with only one residue substitution that shows the capability to reduce amyloidogenesis. Taking into account that specific membrane lipids have been considered as a key factor in the induction of cytotoxicity, in this study, following the same design strategy, we characterize the effect of a series of lipids upon several polypeptide domains that show the highest aggregation propensity. The characterization of the C-native segment of hIAPP (residues F23-Y37), together with novel variants F23R and I26A allowed us to demonstrate an effect upon the formation of beta-sheet structures. Our results suggest that zwitterionic phospholipids promote adsorption of the C-native segments at the lipid-interface and beta-sheet formation with the exception of the F23R variant. Moreover, the presence of cholesterol did not modify this behavior, and the beta-sheet structural transitions were not registered when the N-terminal domain of hIAPP (K1-S20) was characterized. Considering that insulin granules are enriched in phosphatidylserine (PS), the property of lipid vesicles containing negatively charged lipids was also evaluated. We found that these types of lipids promote beta-sheet conformational transitions in both the C-native segment and the new variants. Furthermore, these PS/peptides arrangements are internalized in Langerhans islet beta-cells, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and trigger critical pathways such as unfolded protein response (UPR), affecting insulin secretion. Since this phenomenon was associated with the presence of cytotoxicity on Langerhans islet beta-cells, it can be concluded that the anionic lipid environment and degree of solvation are critical conditions for the stability of segments with the propensity to form beta-sheet structures, a situation that will eventually affect the structural characteristics and stability of IAPP within insulin granules, thus modifying the insulin secretion.
32842666/Elucidating the Inhibitory Effect of Resveratrol and Its Structural Analogs on Selected Nucleotide-Related Enzymes Resveratrol, the most widely studied natural phytochemical, has been shown to interact with different target proteins. Previous studies show that resveratrol binds and inhibits DNA polymerases and some other enzymes; however, the binding and functioning mechanisms remain unknown. The elucidated knowledge of inhibitory mechanisms of resveratrol will assist us in new drug discovery. We utilized molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to reveal how resveratrol and structurally similar compounds bind to various nucleotide-dependent enzymes, specifically, DNA polymerases, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and ribonucleotide reductase. The results show that resveratrol and its analogs exert their inhibitory effects by competing with the substrate dNTPs in these enzymes and blocking elongation of chain polymerization. In addition, the results imply that resveratrol binds to a variety of other ATP-/NTP-binding proteins.
32971865/Arsenic Methyltransferase and Methylation of Inorganic Arsenic Arsenic occurs naturally in the environment, and exists predominantly as inorganic arsenite (As (III) and arsenate As (V)). Arsenic contamination of drinking water has long been recognized as a major global health concern. Arsenic exposure causes changes in skin color and lesions, and more severe health conditions such as black foot disease as well as various cancers originating in the lungs, skin, and bladder. In order to efficiently metabolize and excrete arsenic, it is methylated to monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acid. One single enzyme, arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) is responsible for generating both metabolites. AS3MT has been purified from several mammalian and nonmammalian species, and its mRNA sequences were determined from amino acid sequences. With the advent of genome technology, mRNA sequences of AS3MT have been predicted from many species throughout the animal kingdom. Horizontal gene transfer had been postulated for this gene through phylogenetic studies, which suggests the importance of this gene in appropriately handling arsenic exposures in various organisms. An altered ability to methylate arsenic is dependent on specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AS3MT. Reduced AS3MT activity resulting in poor metabolism of iAs has been shown to reduce expression of the tumor suppressor gene, p16, which is a potential pathway in arsenic carcinogenesis. Arsenic is also known to induce oxidative stress in cells. However, the presence of antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter sequences of AS3MT in several species does not correlate with the ability to methylate arsenic. ARE elements are known to bind NRF2 and induce antioxidant enzymes to combat oxidative stress. NRF2 may be partly responsible for the biotransformation of iAs and the generation of methylated arsenic species via AS3MT. In this article, arsenic metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, a discussion of the AS3MT gene and its evolutionary history, and DNA methylation resulting from arsenic exposure have been reviewed.
32854353/Functional Analysis of P450 Monooxygenase SrrO in the Biosynthesis of Butenolide-Type Signaling Molecules in Streptomyces rochei Streptomyces rochei 7434AN4 produces two structurally unrelated polyketide antibiotics lankacidin and lankamycin, and their biosynthesis is tightly controlled by butenolide-type signaling molecules SRB1 and SRB2. SRBs are synthesized by SRB synthase SrrX, and induce lankacidin and lankamycin production at 40 nM concentration. We here investigated the role of a P450 monooxygenase gene srrO (orf84), which is located adjacent to srrX (orf85), in SRB biosynthesis. An srrO mutant KA54 accumulated lankacidin and lankamycin at a normal level when compared with the parent strain. To elucidate the chemical structures of the signaling molecules accumulated in KA54 (termed as KA54-SRBs), this mutant was cultured (30 L) and the active components were purified. Two active components (KA54-SRB1 and KA54-SRB2) were detected in ESI-MS and chiral HPLC analysis. The molecular formulae for KA54-SRB1 and KA54-SRB2 are C15H26O4 and C16H28O4, whose values are one oxygen smaller and two hydrogen larger when compared with those for SRB1 and SRB2, respectively. Based on extensive NMR analysis, the signaling molecules in KA54 were determined to be 6'-deoxo-SRB1 and 6'-deoxo-SRB2. Gel shift analysis indicated that a ligand affinity of 6'-deoxo-SRB1 to the specific receptor SrrA was 100-fold less than that of SRB1. We performed bioconversion of the synthetic 6'-deoxo-SRB1 in the Streptomyces lividans recombinant carrying SrrO-expression plasmid. Substrate 6'-deoxo-SRB1 was converted through 6'-deoxo-6'-hydroxy-SRB1 to SRB1 in a time-dependent manner. Thus, these results clearly indicated that SrrO catalyzes the C-6' oxidation at a final step in SRB biosynthesis.
32961653/Triapine Derivatives Act as Copper Delivery Vehicles to Induce Deadly Metal Overload in Cancer Cells Thiosemicarbazones continue to attract the interest of researchers as potential anticancer drugs. For example, 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, or triapine, is the most well-known representative of this class of compounds that has entered multiple phase I and II clinical trials. Two new triapine derivatives HL1 and HL2 were prepared by condensation reactions of 2-pyridinamidrazone and S-methylisothiosemicarbazidium chloride with 3-N-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl) amino-pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, followed by a Boc-deprotection procedure. Subsequent reaction of HL1 and HL2 with CuCl2 2H2O in 1:1 molar ratio in methanol produced the complexes [CuII(HL1)Cl2] H2O (1 H2O) and [CuII(HL2)Cl2] (2). The reaction of HL2 with Fe(NO3)3 9H2O in 2:1 molar ratio in the presence of triethylamine afforded the complex [FeIII(L2)2]NO3 0.75H2O (3 0.75H2O), in which the isothiosemicarbazone acts as a tridentate monoanionic ligand. The crystal structures of HL1, HL2 and metal complexes 1 and 2 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The UV-Vis and EPR spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed that complexes 1 and 2 underwent irreversible reduction of Cu(II) with subsequent ligand release, while 3 showed an almost reversible electrochemical reduction in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Aqueous solution behaviour of HL1 and 1, as well as of HL2 and its complex 2, was monitored as well. Complexes 1-3 were tested against ovarian carcinoma cells, as well as noncancerous embryonic kidney cells, in comparison to respective free ligands, triapine and cisplatin. While the free ligands HL1 and HL2 were devoid of antiproliferative activity, their respective metal complexes showed remarkable antiproliferative activity in a micromolar concentration range. The activity was not related to the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) R2 protein, but rather to cancer cell homeostasis disturbance:leading to the disruption of cancer cell signalling.
32847137/Rhizobacteria Inoculation Effects on Phytohormone Status of Potato Microclones Cultivated In Vitro under Osmotic Stress Water deficits inhibit plant growth and decrease crop productivity. Remedies are needed to counter this increasingly urgent problem in practical farming. One possible approach is to utilize rhizobacteria known to increase plant resistance to abiotic and other stresses. We therefore studied the effects of inoculating the culture medium of potato microplants grown in vitro with Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 or Ochrobactrum cytisi IPA7.2. Growth and hormone content of the plants were evaluated under stress-free conditions and under a water deficit imposed with polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). Inoculation with either bacterium promoted the growth in terms of leaf mass accumulation. The effects were associated with increased concentrations of auxin and cytokinin hormones in the leaves and stems and with suppression of an increase in the leaf abscisic acid that PEG treatment otherwise promoted in the potato microplants. O. cytisi IPA7.2 had a greater growth-stimulating effect than A. brasilense Sp245 on stressed plants, while A. brasilense Sp245 was more effective in unstressed plants. The effects were likely to be the result of changes to the plant's hormonal balance brought about by the bacteria. 
32859125/Chronic Cannabidiol Administration Attenuates Skeletal Muscle De Novo Ceramide Synthesis Pathway and Related Metabolic Effects in a Rat Model of High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity Numerous studies showed that sustained obesity results in accumulation of bioactive lipid derivatives in several tissues, including skeletal muscle, which further contributes to the development of metabolic disturbances and insulin resistance (IR). The latest data indicate that a potential factor regulating lipid and glucose metabolism is a phytocannabinoid:cannabidiol (CBD), a component of medical marijuana (Cannabis). Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether chronic CBD administration influences bioactive lipid content (e.g., ceramide (CER)), as well as glucose metabolism, in the red skeletal muscle (musculus gastrocnemius) with predominant oxidative metabolism. All experiments were conducted on an animal model of obesity, i.e., Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or standard rodent chow, and subsequently injected with CBD in a dose of 10 mg/kg or its solvent for two weeks. The sphingolipid content was assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), while, in order to determine insulin and glucose concentrations, immunoenzymatic and colorimetric methods were used. The protein expression from sphingolipid and insulin signaling pathways, as well as endocannabinoidome components, was evaluated by immunoblotting. Unexpectedly, our experimental model revealed that the significantly intensified intramuscular de novo CER synthesis pathway in the HFD group was attenuated by chronic CBD treatment. Additionally, due to CBD administration, the content of other sphingolipid derivatives, i.e., sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was restored in the high-fat feeding state, which coincided with an improvement in skeletal muscle insulin signal transduction and glycogen recovery.
32872300/The Morphoregulatory Role of Thidiazuron: Metabolomics-Guided Hypothesis Generation for Mechanisms of Activity Thidiazuron (TDZ) is a diphenylurea synthetic herbicide and plant growth regulator used to defoliate cotton crops and to induce regeneration of recalcitrant species in plant tissue culture. In vitro cultures of African violet thin petiole sections are an ideal model system for studies of TDZ-induced morphogenesis. TDZ induces de novo shoot organogenesis at low concentrations and somatic embryogenesis at higher concentrations of exposure. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to identify metabolites in control and TDZ-treated tissues. Statistical analysis including metabolite clustering, pattern and pathway tools, logical algorithms, synthetic biotransformations and hormonomics identified TDZ-induced changes in metabolism. A total of 18,602 putative metabolites with extracted masses and predicted formulae were identified with 1412 features that were found only in TDZ-treated tissues and 312 that increased in response to TDZ. The monomer of TDZ was not detected intact in the tissues but putative oligomers were found in the database and we hypothesize that these may form by a Diels-Alder reaction. Accumulation oligomers in the tissue may act as a reservoir, slowly releasing the active TDZ monomer over time. Cleavage of the amide bridge released TDZ-metabolites into the tissues including organic nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds. Metabolomics data analysis generated six novel hypotheses that can be summarized as an overall increase in uptake of sugars from the culture media, increase in primary metabolism, redirection of terpene metabolism and mediation of stress metabolism via indoleamine and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Further research into the specific mechanisms hypothesized is likely to unravel the mode of action of TDZ and to provide new insights into the control of plant morphogenesis.
32825031/Expression and Purification of Recombinant GHK Tripeptides Are Able to Protect against Acute Cardiotoxicity from Exposure to Waterborne-Copper in Zebrafish In this study, an alternative method is developed to replace chemical synthesis to produce glycyl-histidyl-lysine (GHK) tripeptides with a bacterial fermentation system. The target GHK tripeptides are cloned into expression plasmids carrying histidine-glutathione-S-transferase (GST) double tags and TEV (tobacco etch virus) cleavage sites at the N-terminus. After overexpression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 cells, the recombinant proteins are purified and recovered by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the chemical and biological properties of the recombinant GHK tripeptides. The results demonstrated that one recombinant GHK tripeptide can bind one copper ion to form a GHK-Cu complex with high affinity, and the recombinant GHK peptide to copper ion ratio is 1:1. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of the copper ions indicated that the oxidation state of copper in the recombinant GHK-Cu complexes here was Cu(II). All of the optical spectrum evidence suggests that the recombinant GHK tripeptide appears to possess the same biophysical and biochemical features as the GHK tripeptide isolated from human plasma. Due to the high binding affinity of GHK tripeptides to copper ions, we used zebrafish as an in vivo model to elucidate whether recombinant GHK tripeptides possess detoxification potential against the cardiotoxicity raised by waterborne Cu(II) exposure. Here, exposure to Cu(II) induced bradycardia and heartbeat irregularity in zebrafish larvae; however, the administration of GHK tripeptides could rescue those experiencing cardiotoxicity, even at the lowest concentration of 1 nM, where the GHK-Cu complex minimized CuSO4-induced cardiotoxicity effects at a GHK:Cu ratio of 1:10. On the other hand, copper and the combination with the GHK tripeptide did not significantly alter other cardiovascular parameters, including stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. Meanwhile, the heart rate and cardiac output were boosted after exposure with 1 nM of GHK peptides. In this study, recombinant GHK tripeptide expression was performed, along with purification and chemical property characterization, which revealed a potent cardiotoxicity protection function in vivo with zebrafish for the first time.
32962141/Production of Aromatic Compounds by Catalytic Depolymerization of Technical and Downstream Biorefinery Lignins Lignocellulosic materials are promising alternatives to non-renewable fossil sources when producing aromatic compounds. Lignins from Populus salicaceae. Pinus radiata and Pinus pinaster from industrial wastes and biorefinery effluents were isolated and characterized. Lignin was depolymerized using homogenous (NaOH) and heterogeneous (Ni-, Cu- or Ni-Cu-hydrotalcites) base catalysis and catalytic hydrogenolysis using Ru/C. When homogeneous base catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) and Ru/C hydrogenolysis were combined on poplar lignin, the aromatics amount was ca. 11 wt.%. Monomer distributions changed depending on the feedstock and the reaction conditions. Aqueous NaOH produced cleavage of the alkyl side chain that was preserved when using modified hydrotalcite catalysts or Ru/C-catalyzed hydrogenolysis in ethanol. Depolymerization using hydrotalcite catalysts in ethanol produced monomers bearing carbonyl groups on the alkyl side chain. The analysis of the reaction mixtures was done by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and diffusion ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY NMR). 31P NMR and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) were also used in this study. The content in poly-(hydroxy)-aromatic ethers in the reaction mixtures decreased upon thermal treatments in ethanol. It was concluded that thermo-solvolysis is key in lignin depolymerization, and that the synergistic effect of Ni and Cu provided monomers with oxidized alkyl side chains.
32854378/Recent Advances in Microbial Production of cis,cis-Muconic Acid cis,cis-Muconic acid (MA) is a valuable C6 dicarboxylic acid platform chemical that is used as a starting material for the production of various valuable polymers and drugs, including adipic acid and terephthalic acid. As an alternative to traditional chemical processes, bio-based MA production has progressed to the establishment of de novo MA pathways in several microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Pseudomonas putida, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Redesign of the metabolic pathway, intermediate flux control, and culture process optimization were all pursued to maximize the microbial MA production yield. Recently, MA production from biomass, such as the aromatic polymer lignin, has also attracted attention from researchers focusing on microbes that are tolerant to aromatic compounds. This paper summarizes recent microbial MA production strategies that involve engineering the metabolic pathway genes as well as the heterologous expression of some foreign genes involved in MA biosynthesis. Microbial MA production will continue to play a vital role in the field of bio-refineries and a feasible way to complement various petrochemical-based chemical processes.
32962160/Evaluation of the Adverse Effects of Chronic Exposure to Donepezil (An Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor) in Adult Zebrafish by Behavioral and Biochemical Assessments Donepezil (DPZ) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for the clinical treatment of mild cognitive impairment. However, DPZ has been reported to have adverse effects, including causing abnormal cardiac rhythm, insomnia, vomiting, and muscle cramps. However, the existence of these effects in subjects without Dementia is unknown. In this study, we use zebrafish to conduct a deeper analysis of the potential adverse effects of DPZ on the short-term memory and behaviors of normal zebrafish by performing multiple behavioral and biochemical assays. Adult zebrafish were exposed to 1 ppm and 2.5 ppm of DPZ. From the results, DPZ caused a slight improvement in the short-term memory of zebrafish and induced significant elevation in aggressiveness, while the novel tank and shoaling tests revealed anxiolytic-like behavior to be caused by DPZ. Furthermore, zebrafish circadian locomotor activity displayed a higher reduction of locomotion and abnormal movement orientation in both low- and high-dose groups, compared to the control group. Biomarker assays revealed that these alterations were associated with an elevation of oxytocin and a reduction of cortisol levels in the brain. Moreover, the significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in muscle tissue suggest DPZ exposure induced muscle tissue oxidative stress and muscle weakness, which may underlie the locomotor activity impairment. In conclusion, we show, for the first time, that chronic waterborne exposure to DPZ can severely induce adverse effects on normal zebrafish in a dose-dependent manner. These unexpected adverse effects on behavioral alteration should be carefully addressed in future studies considering DPZ conducted on zebrafish or other animals.
32854243/Evaluation of the In Vitro Oral Wound Healing Effects of Pomegranate (Punica granatum) Rind Extract and Punicalagin, in Combination with Zn (II) Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a well-established folklore medicine, demonstrating benefits in treating numerous conditions partly due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Such desirable medicinal capabilities are attributed to a high hydrolysable tannin content, especially punicalagin. However, few studies have evaluated the abilities of pomegranate to promote oral healing, during situations such as periodontal disease or trauma. Therefore, this study evaluated the antioxidant and in vitro gingival wound healing effects of pomegranate rind extract (PRE) and punicalagin, alone and in combination with Zn (II). In vitro antioxidant activities were studied using DPPH and ABTS assays, with total PRE phenolic content measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. PRE, punicalagin and Zn (II) combination effects on human gingival fibroblast viability/proliferation and migration were investigated by MTT assay and scratch wounds, respectively. Punicalagin demonstrated superior antioxidant capacities to PRE, although Zn (II) exerted no additional influences. PRE, punicalagin and Zn (II) reduced gingival fibroblast viability and migration at high concentrations, but retained viability at lower concentrations without Zn (II). Fibroblast speed and distance travelled during migration were also enhanced by punicalagin with Zn (II) at low concentrations. Therefore, punicalagin in combination with Zn (II) may promote certain anti-inflammatory and fibroblast responses to aid oral healing.
32957713/Mulinane- and Azorellane-Type Diterpenoids: A Systematic Review of Their Biosynthesis, Chemistry, and Pharmacology Mulinane- and azorellane-type diterpenoids have unique tricyclic fused five-, six-, and seven-membered systems and a wide range of biological properties, including antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, spermicidal, gastroprotective, and anti-inflammatory, among others. These secondary metabolites are exclusive constituents of medicinal plants belonging to the Azorella, Laretia, and Mulinum genera. In the last 30 years, more than 95 mulinanes and azorellanes have been reported, 49 of them being natural products, 4 synthetics, and the rest semisynthetic and biotransformed derivatives. This systematic review highlights the biosynthetic origin, the chemistry, and the pharmacological activities of this remarkably interesting group of diterpenoids.
32825369/Low Doses of Cuscuta reflexa Extract Act as Natural Biostimulants to Improve the Germination Vigor, Growth, and Grain Yield of Wheat Grown under Water Stress: Photosynthetic Pigments, Antioxidative Defense Mechanisms, and Nutrient Acquisition The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of Cuscuta reflexa extract (CRE) on the activities of germination enzymes, seed germination vigor, biomass production, physio-biochemical attributes, and seed yield of water-stressed wheat plants. Different levels of CRE (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50%), including water soaking, were used as seed priming. Water stress negatively affected the seed germination, germination enzyme activities, growth, yield, and different physio-biochemical attributes of wheat plants. Low doses of CRE (10, 20, and 30%) ameliorated the adverse effects of water stress on seed germination attributes, and activities of germination enzymes, but negative impacts were recorded at higher doses (40 and 50%) of CRE. Water-stressed wheat plants grown from seeds pre-treated with low doses of CRE also showed better growth and yield as compared with non-treated ones, and that was associated with an improvement in water relations, photosynthetic pigments, nutrient acquisition, reduced lipid peroxidation, and better antioxidative defense mechanisms. The maximum increase in seed yield was 14.77 and 12.32%, found in plants grown from seeds treated with 20% and 10% CRE, respectively. In conclusion, it is suggested that using low doses of CRE as seed priming can contribute to better wheat yield under water stress, especially in semi-arid and arid areas.
32957726/Natural Compounds Modulate Drug Transporter Mediated Oral Cancer Treatment Oral cancer (OC) is a serious health problem. Surgery is the best method to treat the disease but might reduce the quality of life of patients. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may enhance quality of life but with some limitations. Therefore, the development of a new strategy to facilitate PDT effectiveness has become crucial. ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) is a membrane protein-associated drug resistance and stemness in cancers. Here, we examined whether ABCG2 plays an important role in regulating the treatment efficacy of PDT and whether ABCG2 inhibition by natural compounds can promote the effect of PDT in OC cells. Several head and neck cancer cells were utilized in this study. OECM1 and SAS cells were selected to investigate the relationship between ABCG2 expression and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation. Western blot analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and survival probability were performed to determine PDT efficacy and cellular stemness upon treatment of different dietary compounds, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and curcumin. In this study, we found that ABCG2 expression varied in OC cells. Hypoglycemic culture for SAS cells enhanced ABCG2 expression as higher ABCG2 expression was associated with lower PpIX accumulation and cellular stemness in OC cells. In contrast, suppression of ABCG2 expression by curcumin and tea polyphenol EGCG led to greater PpIX accumulation and enhanced PDT treatment efficiency in OC cells. In conclusion, ABCG2 plays an important role in regulating the effect of PDT. Change in glucose concentration and treatment with natural compounds modulated ABCG2 expression, resulting in altered PDT efficacy for OC cells. These modulations raise a potential new treatment strategy for early-stage OCs.
32854282/Green Synthesis of Antileishmanial and Antifungal Silver Nanoparticles Using Corn Cob Xylan as a Reducing and Stabilizing Agent Corn cob is an agricultural byproduct that produces an estimated waste burden in the thousands of tons annually, but it is also a good source of xylan, an important bioactive polysaccharide. Silver nanoparticles containing xylan (nanoxylan) were produced using an environmentally friendly synthesis method. To do this, we extracted xylan from corn cobs using an ultrasound technique, which was confirmed by both chemical and NMR analyses. This xylan contained xylose, glucose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 50:21:14:9:2.5:2.5, respectively. Nanoxylan synthesis was analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy at kmax = 469 nm and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), which confirmed the presence of both silver and xylan in the nanoxylan product. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the nanoxylan particles were ~102.0 nm in size and spherical in shape, respectively. DLS also demonstrated that nanoxylan was stable for 12 months and coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) showed that the nanoxylan particles were 19% silver. Nanoxylan reduced Leishmania amazonensis promastigote viability with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 25 mug/mL, while xylan alone showed no effective. Additionally, nanoxylan exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans (MIC = 7.5 mug/mL), C. parapsilosis (MIC = 7.5 mug/mL), and Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC = 7.5 mug/mL). Taken together, these data suggest that it is possible to synthesize silver nanoparticles using xylan and that these nanoxylan exert improved antileishmanial and antifungal activities when compared to the untreated polysaccharide or silver nitrate used for their synthesis. Thus, nanoxylan may represent a promising new class of antiparasitic agents for use in the treatment of these microorganisms.
32948080/Isolation of Cysteine-Rich Peptides from Citrullus colocynthis The plant Citrullus colocynthis, a member of the squash (Cucurbitaceae) family, has a long history in traditional medicine. Based on the ancient knowledge about the healing properties of herbal preparations, plant-derived small molecules, e.g., salicylic acid, or quinine, have been integral to modern drug discovery. Additionally, many plant families, such as Cucurbitaceae, are known as a rich source for cysteine-rich peptides, which are gaining importance as valuable pharmaceuticals. In this study, we characterized the C. colocynthis peptidome using chemical modification of cysteine residues, and mass shift analysis via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. We identified the presence of at least 23 cysteine-rich peptides in this plant, and eight novel peptides, named citcol-1 to -8, with a molecular weight between ~3650 and 4160 Da, were purified using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their amino acid sequences were determined by de novo assignment of b- and y-ion series of proteolytic peptide fragments. In silico analysis of citcol peptides revealed a high sequence similarity to trypsin inhibitor peptides from Cucumis sativus, Momordica cochinchinensis, Momordica macrophylla and Momordica sphaeroidea. Using genome/transcriptome mining it was possible to identify precursor sequences of this peptide family in related Cucurbitaceae species that cluster into trypsin inhibitor and antimicrobial peptides. Based on our analysis, the presence or absence of a crucial Arg/Lys residue at the putative P1 position may be used to classify these common cysteine-rich peptides by functional properties. Despite sequence homology and the common classification into the inhibitor cysteine knot family, these peptides appear to have diverse and additional bioactivities yet to be revealed.
32878322/Biological Evaluation of Oxindole Derivative as a Novel Anticancer Agent against Human Kidney Carcinoma Cells Renal cell carcinoma has emerged as one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the USA. Here, we examined the anticancer profile of oxindole derivatives (SH-859) in human renal cancer cells. Targeting 786-O cells by SH-859 inhibited cell growth and affected the protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 pathway, which in turn downregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter-1, as well as other signaling proteins. Treatment with SH-859 altered glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and levels of adenosine triphosphate and cellular metabolites. Flow cytometry revealed the induction of apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in renal cancer cells following SH-859 treatment. Induction of autophagy was also confirmed after SH-859 treatment by acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine staining, immunocytochemistry, and Western blot analyses. Finally, SH-859 also inhibited the tumor development in a xenograft model. Thus, SH-859 can serve as a potential molecule for the treatment of human renal carcinoma.
32878262/Branched-Chain Fatty Acids as Mediators of the Activation of Hepatic Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha by a Fungal Lipid Extract The study aimed to test the hypothesis that monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and a lipid extract of Conidiobolus heterosporus (CHLE), rich in monomethyl BCFAs, are able to activate the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Rat Fao cells were incubated with the monomethyl BCFAs 12-methyltridecanoic acid (MTriA), 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (MTA), isopalmitic acid (IPA) and 14-methylhexadecanoic acid (MHD), and the direct activation of PPARalpha was evaluated by reporter gene assay using a PPARalpha responsive reporter gene. Furthermore, Fao cells were incubated with different concentrations of the CHLE and PPARalpha activation was also evaluated by using the reporter gene assay, and by determining the mRNA concentrations of selected PPARalpha target genes by real-time RT-PCR. The reporter gene assay revealed that IPA and the CHLE, but not MTriA, MHD and MTA, activate the PPARalpha responsive reporter gene. CHLE dose-dependently increased mRNA concentrations of the PPARalpha target genes acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1), cytochrome P450 4A1 (CYP4A1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and solute carrier family 22 (organic cation/carnitine transporter), member 5 (SLC22A5). In conclusion, the monomethyl BCFA IPA is a potent PPARalpha activator. CHLE activates PPARalpha-dependent gene expression in Fao cells, an effect that is possibly mediated by IPA.
32825613/The Influence of Nasturtium officinale R. Br. Agar and Agitated Microshoot Culture Media on Glucosinolate and Phenolic Acid Production, and Antioxidant Activity This paper presents an optimization of conditions for microshoot cultures of Nasturtium officinale R. Br. (watercress). Variants of the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing different plant growth regulators (PGRs): cytokinins:BA (6-benzyladenine), 2iP (6-gamma,gamma-dimethylallylaminopurine), KIN (kinetin), Zea (zeatin), and auxins:IAA (3-indoleacetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid), 2,4-d (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), IPA (indole-3-pyruvic acid), NAA (naphthalene-1-acetic acid), total 27 MS variants, were tested in agar and agitated cultures. Growth cycles were tested for 10, 20, or 30 days in the agar cultures, and 10 or 20 days in the agitated cultures. Glucosinolate and phenolic acid production, total phenolic content and antioxidant potential were evaluated. The total amounts of glucosinolates ranged from 100.23 to 194.77 mg/100 g dry weight of biomass (DW) in agar cultures, and from 78.09 to 182.80 mg/100 g DW in agitated cultures. The total phenolic acid content varied from 15.89 to 237.52 mg/100 g DW for the agar cultures, and from 70.80 to 236.74 mg/100 g DW for the agitated cultures. Extracts of the cultured biomass contained higher total amounts of phenolic acids, lower total amounts of glucosinolates, a higher total phenolic content and similar antioxidant potentials compared to plant material. The analyses performed confirmed for the first time the explicit influence on secondary metabolite production and on the antioxidant potential. The significance was statistically estimated in a complex manner.
32825281/Improved Production and Biophysical Analysis of Recombinant Silicatein-alpha Silicatein-alpha is a hydrolase found in siliceous sea sponges with a unique ability to condense and hydrolyse silicon-oxygen bonds. The enzyme is thus of interest from the perspective of its unusual enzymology, and for potential applications in the sustainable synthesis of siloxane-containing compounds. However, research into this enzyme has previously been hindered by the tendency of silicatein-alpha towards aggregation and insolubility. Herein, we report the development of an improved method for the production of a trigger factor-silicatein fusion protein by switching the previous hexahistidine tag for a Strep-II tag, resulting in 244-fold improvement in protein yield compared to previous methods. Light scattering and thermal denaturation analyses show that under the best storage conditions, although oligomerisation is never entirely abolished, these nanoscale aggregates of the Strep-tagged protein exhibit improved colloidal stability and solubility. Enzymatic assays show that the Strep-tagged protein retains catalytic competency, but exhibits lower activity compared to the His6-tagged protein. These results suggest that the hexahistidine tag is capable of non-specific catalysis through their imidazole side chains, highlighting the importance of careful consideration when selecting a purification tag. Overall, the Strep-tagged fusion protein reported here can be produced to a higher yield, exhibits greater stability, and allows the native catalytic properties of this protein to be assessed.
32962166/Metabolic Diversity and Therapeutic Potential of Holarrhena pubescens: An Important Ethnomedicinal Plant Holarrhena pubescens is an important medicinal plant of the Apocynaceae family that is widely distributed over the Indian subcontinent. The plant is extensively used in Ayurveda and other traditional medicinal systems without obvious adverse effects. Beside notable progress in the biological and phytochemical evaluation of this plant over the past few years, comprehensive reviews of H. pubescens are limited in scope. It has economic importance due to the extensive use of seeds as an antidiabetic. Furthermore, the plant is extensively reported in traditional uses among the natives of Asia and Africa, while scientifical validation for various ailments has not been studied either in vitro or in vivo. This review aims to summarize information on the pharmacology, traditional uses, active constituents, safety and toxicity of H. pubescens. Chemical analysis of H. pubescens extracts revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds, such as conessine, isoconnessine, conessimine, conimine, conessidine, conkurchicine, holarrhimine, conarrhimine, mokluangin A-D and antidysentericine. Overall, this review covers the ethnopharmacology, phytochemical composition, and pharmacological potential of H. pubescens, with a critical discussion of its toxicity, biological activities (in vitro and in vivo), the mechanism of action, as well as suggestions for further basic and clinical research.
32825480/Insight into the Anticancer Activity of Copper(II) 5-Methylenetrimethylammonium-Thiosemicarbazonates and Their Interaction with Organic Cation Transporters A series of four water-soluble salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazones with a positively charged trimethylammonium moiety ([H2LR]Cl, R = H, Me, Et, Ph) and four copper(II) complexes [Cu(HLR)Cl]Cl (1-4) were synthesised with the aim to study (i) their antiproliferative activity in cancer cells and, (ii) for the first time for thiosemicarbazones, the interaction with membrane transport proteins, specifically organic cation transporters OCT1-3. The compounds were comprehensively characterised by analytical, spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction methods. The highest cytotoxic effect was observed in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-5YSY after 24 h exposure and follows the rank order: 3 > 2 > 4 > cisplatin > 1 >> [H2LR]Cl. The copper(II) complexes showed marked interaction with OCT1-3, comparable to that of well-known OCT inhibitors (decynium 22, prazosin and corticosterone) in the cell-based radiotracer uptake assays. The work paves the way for the development of more potent and selective anticancer drugs and/or OCT inhibitors.
33076836/The combined antibacterial effects of sodium new houttuyfonate and berberine chloride against growing and persistent methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus Background Infections caused by drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, especially vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), leave clinicians with limited therapeutic options for treatment. Persister cells is a leading cause of recalcitrant infection and antibiotic treatment failure, and there is no drug in clinical use that specifically targets persister cells currently. Here, we report a promising combination therapy of sodium new houttuyfonate (SNH) and berberine chloride (BBR) which is able to eradicate both growing and persistent drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Results The susceptibility test showed SNH exhibited anti-MRSA activity with MIC90 at 64 mug/mL, while BBR showed weak anti-MRSA activity with MIC90 at 512 mug/mL. MICs of BBR in combination with 1/2 MIC SNH decreased by 4 to 64 folds compared with MICs of BBR alone. The results of time-killing assays revealed that the combined use of sub-MIC SNH and BBR offered an in vitro synergistic action against growing MRSA (including pathogenic MRSA) and VISA strains. More importantly, the combination of SNH and BBR was able to eradicate VISA Mu50 and pathogenic MRSA persister cells. The synergistic effect is likely related to the interruption of the cell membrane caused by SNH, which is confirmed by scanning electron microscope and membrane potential and permeability analysis. Conclusions Our study provide a promising clinical curative strategy for combating drug-resistant S. aureus infections, especially for recalcitrant infections caused by persister cells. Supplementary information Supplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12866-020-02003-2.
33076820/The synergetic effect of Imipenem-clarithromycin combination in the Mycobacteroides abscessus complex Background Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms and the incidence of NTM infections has been increasing in recent years. Mycobacteroides abscessus (M. abscessus) is one of the most antimicrobial-resistant NTM; however, no reliable antibiotic regimen can be officially advocated. We evaluated the efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with various antimicrobial agents against the M. abscessus complex. Results Twenty-nine clinical strains of M. abscessus were isolated from various clinical samples. Of the isolates, 10 (34.5%) were of M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, 18 (62.1%) of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense, and 1 (3.4%) of M. abscessus subsp. bolletii. MICs of three antimicrobial agents (amikacin, imipenem, and moxifloxacin) were measured with or without clarithromycin. The imipenem-clarithromycin combination significantly reduced MICs compared to clarithromycin and imipenem monotherapies, including against resistant strains. The association between susceptibility of the M. abscessus complex and each combination of agents was significant (p = 0.001). Adjusted residuals indicated that the imipenem-clarithromycin combination had the synergistic effect (adjusted residual = 3.1) and suppressed the antagonistic effect (adjusted residual = - 3.1). In subspecies of M. abscessus complex, the association with susceptibility of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense was similarly statistically significant (p = 0.036: adjusted residuals of synergistic and antagonistic effect respectively: 2.6 and - 2.6). The association with susceptibility of M. abscessus subsp. abscessus also showed a similar trend but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Our data suggest that the imipenem-clarithromycin combination could be the recommended therapeutic choice for the treatment of M. abscessus complex owing to its ability to restore antimicrobial susceptibility.
33087168/Colonization of a hand washing sink in a veterinary hospital by an Enterobacter hormaechei strain carrying multiple resistances to high importance antimicrobials Background Hospital intensive care units (ICUs) are known reservoirs of multidrug resistant nosocomial bacteria. Targeted environmental monitoring of these organisms in health care facilities can strengthen infection control procedures. A routine surveillance of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in a large Australian veterinary teaching hospital detected the opportunistic pathogen Enterobacter hormaechei in a hand washing sink of the ICU. The organism persisted for several weeks, despite two disinfection attempts. Four isolates were characterized in this study. Methods Brilliance-ESBL selective plates were inoculated from environmental swabs collected throughout the hospital. Presumptive identification was done by conventional biochemistry. Genomes of multidrug resistant Enterobacter were entirely sequenced with Illumina and Nanopore platforms. Phylogenetic markers, mobile genetic elements and antimicrobial resistance genes were identified in silico. Antibiograms of isolates and transconjugants were established with Sensititre microdilution plates. Results The isolates possessed a chromosomal Tn7-associated silver/copper resistance locus and a large IncH12 conjugative plasmid encoding resistance against tellurium, arsenic, mercury and nine classes of antimicrobials. Clusters of antimicrobial resistance genes were associated with class 1 integrons and IS26, IS903 and ISCR transposable elements. The blaSHV-12, qnrB2 and mcr-9.1 genes, respectively conferring resistance to cephalosporins, quinolones and colistin, were present in a locus flanked by two IS903 copies. ESBL production and enrofloxacin resistance were confirmed phenotypically. The isolates appeared susceptible to colistin, possibly reflecting the inducible nature of mcr-9.1. Conclusions The persistence of this strain in the veterinary hospital represented a risk of further accumulation and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, prompting a thorough disinfection of the ICU. The organism was not recovered from subsequent environmental swabs, and nosocomial Enterobacter infections were not observed in the hospital during that period. This study shows that targeted routine environmental surveillance programs to track organisms with major resistance phenotypes, coupled with disinfection procedures and follow-up microbiological cultures are useful to control these risks in sensitive areas of large veterinary hospitals.
33096982/Methanosarcina acetivorans contains a functional ISC system for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis Background The production of methane by methanogens is dependent on numerous iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins; yet, the machinery involved in Fe-S cluster biogenesis in methanogens remains largely unknown. Methanogen genomes encode uncharacterized homologs of the core components of the ISC (IscS and IscU) and SUF (SufBC) Fe-S cluster biogenesis systems found in bacteria and eukaryotes. Methanosarcina acetivorans contains three iscSU and two sufCB gene clusters. Here, we report genetic and biochemical characterization of M. acetivorans iscSU2. Results Purified IscS2 exhibited pyridoxal 5'- phosphate-dependent release of sulfur from L-cysteine. Incubation of purified IscU2 with IscS2, cysteine, and iron (Fe2+) resulted in the formation of [4Fe-4S] clusters in IscU2. IscU2 transferred a [4Fe-4S] cluster to purified M. acetivorans apo-aconitase. IscU2 also restored the aconitase activity in air-exposed M. acetivorans cell lysate. These biochemical results demonstrate that IscS2 is a cysteine desulfurase and that IscU2 is a Fe-S cluster scaffold. M. acetivorans strain DJL60 deleted of iscSU2 was generated to ascertain the in vivo importance of IscSU2. Strain DJL60 had Fe-S cluster content and growth similar to the parent strain but lower cysteine desulfurase activity. Strain DJL60 also had lower intracellular persulfide content compared to the parent strain when cysteine was an exogenous sulfur source, linking IscSU2 to sulfur metabolism. Conclusions This study establishes that M. acetivorans contains functional IscS and IscU, the core components of the ISC Fe-S cluster biogenesis system and provides the first evidence that ISC operates in methanogens.

33109242/Global trends of antimicrobial susceptibility to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam: a surveillance study from the ATLAS program (2012-2016) Background This study reports the global trends of antimicrobial susceptibility to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam using data from the Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) program between 2012 and 2016. Methods For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. Results Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. Conclusion The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed.
33109098/Efficacy of non-opioid analgesics to control postoperative pain: a network meta-analysis Background The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) Meloxicam 30 mg (MIV), an investigational non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and certain other IV non-opioid analgesics for moderate-severe acute postoperative pain. Methods We searched PubMed and CENTRAL for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) (years 2000-2019, adult human subjects) of IV non-opioid analgesics (IV NSAIDs or IV Acetaminophen) used to treat acute pain after abdominal, hysterectomy, bunionectomy or orthopedic procedures. A Bayesian NMA was conducted in R to rank treatments based on the standardized mean differences in sum of pain intensity difference from baseline up to 24 h postoperatively (sum of pain intensity difference: SPID 24). The probability and the cumulative probability of rank for each treatment were calculated, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was applied to distinguish treatments on the basis of their outcomes such that higher SUCRA values indicate better outcomes. The study protocol was prospectively registered with by PROSPERO (CRD42019117360). Results Out of 2313 screened studies, 27 studies with 36 comparative observations were included, producing a treatment network that included the four non-opioid IV pain medications of interest (MIV, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen). MIV was associated with the largest SPID 24 for all procedure categories and comparators. The SUCRA ranking table indicated that MIV had the highest probability for the most effective treatment for abdominal (89.5%), bunionectomy (100%), and hysterectomy (99.8%). MIV was associated with significantly less MME utilization versus all comparators for abdominal procedures, hysterectomy, and versus acetaminophen in orthopedic procedures. Elsewhere MME utilization outcomes for MIV were largely equivalent or nominally better than other comparators. Odds of ORADEs were significantly higher for all comparators vs MIV for orthopedic (gastrointestinal) and hysterectomy (respiratory). Conclusions MIV 30 mg may provide better pain reduction with similar or better safety compared to other approved IV non-opioid analgesics. Caution is warranted in interpreting these results as all comparisons involving MIV were indirect.
33115408/Comparison of the impact of propofol versus sevoflurane on early postoperative recovery in living donors after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy: a prospective randomized controlled study Background Enhancing postoperative recovery of the donor is important to encourage living kidney donation. We investigated the effects of anesthetic agents (intravenous [IV] propofol versus inhaled [IH] sevoflurane) on the quality of early recovery of healthy living kidney donors after hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) under analgesic intrathecal morphine injection. Methods This single-center, prospective randomized controlled study enrolled 80 living donors undergoing HALN from October 2019 to June 2020 at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. Donors were randomly assigned to the IV propofol group or IH sevoflurane group. To measure the quality of recovery, we used the Korean version of the Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire (QoR-40 K) on postoperative day (POD) 1, and ambulation (success rate, number of footsteps) 6-12 h after surgery and on POD 1. The pain score for the wound site, IV opioid requirement, postoperative complications including incidences of nausea/vomiting, and length of in-hospital stay were also assessed. Results The global QoR-40 K score and all subscale scores (physical comfort, emotional state, physical independence, psychological support, and pain) were significantly higher in the IV propofol group than in the IH sevoflurane group. The numbers of footsteps at all time points were also higher in the IV propofol group. Donors in the IV propofol group had a lower incidence of nausea/vomiting, and a shorter hospitalization period. Conclusions Total IV anesthesia with propofol led to better early postoperative recovery than that associated with IH sevoflurane. Trial registration Clinical Research Information Service, Republic of Korea (approval number: KCT0004351) on October 18, 2019.
33115407/Phenotypic and proteomic approaches of the response to iron-limited condition in Staphylococcus lugdunensis Background Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus part of the commensal skin flora but emerge as an important opportunistic pathogen. Because iron limitation is a crucial stress during infectious process, we performed phenotypic study and compared proteomic profiles of this species incubated in absence and in presence of the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP). Results No modification of cell morphology nor cell wall thickness were observed in presence of DIP. However iron-limitation condition promoted biofilm formation and reduced the ability to cope with oxidative stress (1 mM H2O2). In addition, S. lugdunensis N920143 cultured with DIP was significantly less virulent in the larvae of Galleria mellonella model of infection than that grown under standard conditions. We verified that these phenotypes were due to an iron limitation by complementation experiments with FeSO4. By mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion, we characterized the first iron-limitation stress proteome in S. lugdunensis. Among 1426 proteins identified, 349 polypeptides were differentially expressed. 222 were more and 127 less abundant in S. lugdunensis incubated in iron-limitation condition, and by RT-qPCR, some of the corresponding genes have been shown to be transcriptionally regulated. Our data revealed that proteins involved in iron metabolism and carriers were over-expressed, as well as several ABC transporters and polypeptides linked to cell wall metabolism. Conversely, enzymes playing a role in the oxidative stress response (especially catalase) were repressed. Conclusions This phenotypic and global proteomic study allowed characterization of the response of S. lugdunensis to iron-limitation. We showed that iron-limitation promoted biofilm formation, but decrease the oxidative stress resistance that may, at least in part, explained the reduced virulence of S. lugdunensis observed under low iron condition.

33121527/Detection of CMY-type beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli isolates from paediatric patients in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico Background The aim of this study was to detect CMY-type beta-lactamases in E. coli isolates obtained from paediatric patients.  Methods In total, 404 infection-causing E. coli isolates resistant to third and fourth generation cephalosporins (3GC, 4GC) were collected from paediatric patients over a 2 years period. The identification and susceptibility profiles were determined with an automated microbiology system. Typing of blaCMY and other beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA and blaGES) was realized by PCR and sequencing. Phenotypic detection of AmpC-type enzymes was performed using boronic acid (20 mg/mL) and cloxacillin (20 mg/mL) as inhibitors, and the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was determined with the double-disk diffusion test with cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftazidime (CAZ) discs alone and in combination with clavulanic acid. The CarbaNP test and modified carbapenem inhibition method (mCIM) were used for isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems. The clonal origin of the isolates was established by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), phylotyping method and multilocus sequence typing.  Results CMY-type beta-lactamases were detected in 18 isolates (4.5%). The allelic variants found were CMY-2 (n = 14) and CMY-42 (n = 4). Of the E. coli strains with CMY, the AmpC phenotypic production test was positive in 11 isolates with cloxacillin and in 15 with boronic acid. ESBL production was detected in 13 isolates. Coexistence with other beta-lactamases was observed such as CTX-M-15 ESBL and original spectrum beta-lactamases TEM-1 and TEM-190. In one isolate, the CarbaNP test was negative, the mCIM was positive, and OXA-48 carbapenemase was detected. Phylogroup A was the most frequent (n = 9) followed by B2, E and F (n = 2, respectively), and through PFGE, no clonal relationship was observed. Eleven different sequence types (ST) were found, with ST10 high-risk clone being the most frequent (n = 4). Seventy-two percent of the isolates were from health care-associated infections; the mortality rate was 11.1%.  Conclusions This is the first report in Mexico of E. coli producing CMY isolated from paediatric patients, demonstrating a frequency of 4.5%. In addition, this is the first finding of E. coli ST10 with CMY-2 and OXA-48.
33126850/Bupivacaine suppresses the progression of gastric cancer through regulating circ_0000376/miR-145-5p axis Background Local anesthetic Bupivacaine commonly used in gastric cancer resection operation has been reported to suppress the progression of gastric cancer. However, the specific mechanism by which Bupivacaine functions is largely unexplored. Methods The viability and metastasis of gastric cancer cells were assessed by Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and transwell migration and invasion assays. The apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activity detection assay and flow cytometry. The glycolysis was analyzed through detecting the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) via Seahorse XF 96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer and the expression of glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) and lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA) via Western blot assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to detect the expression of circular RNA 0000376 (circ_0000376) and microRNA-145-5p (miR-145-5p). The interaction between circ_0000376 and miR-145-5p was predicted using Circular RNA Interactome database and validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results Bupivacaine restrained the viability, metastasis and glycolytic process while promoted the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Bupivacaine decreased the level of circ_0000376 while enhanced the abundance of miR-145-5p in gastric cancer cells. Circ_0000376 accelerated the malignant behaviors of gastric cancer cells. MiR-145-5p directly interacted with circ_0000376 in gastric cancer cells, and miR-145-5p was negatively regulated by circ_0000376. The addition of circ_0000376 or the interference of miR-145-5p partly reversed Bupivacaine-mediated influences in gastric cancer cells. Conclusion Bupivacaine exerted an anti-tumor role to suppress the progression of gastric cancer through reducing the abundance of circ_0000376 and up-regulating miR-145-5p.
33050067/Pharmaceutical Efficacy of Gypenoside LXXV on Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Ginsenosides have offered a wide array of beneficial roles in the pharmacological regulation of hepatic metabolic syndromes, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and obesity. Of the numerous ginsenosides, Rg3 has been widely investigated, but there have been few studies of gypenosides (Gyp). Particularly, no study on Gyp LXXV has been reported to date. Here, to firstly explore the pharmacological effects of Gyp LXXV against NASH and the related mechanism, methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH mice and hepatic cells (stellate cells, hepatic macrophages, and hepatocytes) were selected. Gyp LXXV exhibited markedly alleviated MCD diet-induced hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis by down-regulating hepatic fibrosis markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin(alpha-SMA), collagen1, transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), MCP-1, interleukin (IL)-1beta, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), and GRP78. Remarkably, histopathological studies confirmed that 15 mg/kg of Gyp LXXV administration to MCD diet-induced mice led to effective prevention of liver injury, lipid accumulation, and activation of hepatic macrophages, indicating that Gyp LXXV might be a potential anti-NASH drug.
33049992/alpha-Bisabolol, a Dietary Bioactive Phytochemical Attenuates Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration through Modulation of Oxidative Stress, Neuroinflammation and Apoptosis in Rotenone-Induced Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease Rotenone (ROT), a plant-derived pesticide is a well-known environmental neurotoxin associated with causation of Parkinson's disease (PD). ROT impairs mitochondrial dysfunction being mitochondrial complex-I (MC-1) inhibitor and perturbs antioxidant-oxidant balance that contributes to the onset and development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. Due to the scarcity of agents to prevent the disease or to cure or halt the progression of symptoms of PD, the focus is on exploring agents from naturally occurring dietary phytochemicals. Among numerous phytochemicals, alpha-Bisabolol (BSB), natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol found in many ornamental flowers and edible plants garnered attention due to its potent pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential. Therefore, the present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of BSB in a rat model of ROT-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration, a pathogenic feature of PD and underlying mechanism targeting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. BSB treatment significantly prevented ROT-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in the substantia nigra and striatum respectively. BSB treatment also attenuated ROT-induced oxidative stress evidenced by inhibition of MDA formation and GSH depletion as well as improvement in antioxidant enzymes, SOD and catalase. BSB treatment also attenuated ROT-induced activation of the glial cells as well as the induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and inflammatory mediators (iNOS and COX-2) in the striatum. In addition to countering oxidative stress and inflammation, BSB also attenuated apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons by attenuating downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspases-3 and 9. Further, BSB was observed to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, cytochrome-C release and reinstates the levels/activity of ATP and MC-I. The findings of the study demonstrate that BSB treatment salvaged dopaminergic neurons, attenuated microglia and astrocyte activation, induction of inflammatory mediators, proinflammatory cytokines and reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic markers. The in vitro study on ABTS radical revealed the antioxidant potential of BSB. The results of the present study are clearly suggestive of the neuroprotective effects of BSB through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in ROT-induced model of PD.
33036250/Dissecting the Cytochrome P450 OleP Substrate Specificity: Evidence for a Preferential Substrate The cytochrome P450 OleP catalyzes the epoxidation of aliphatic carbons on both the aglycone 8.8a-deoxyoleandolide (DEO) and the monoglycosylated L-olivosyl-8.8a-deoxyoleandolide (L-O-DEO) intermediates of oleandomycin biosynthesis. We investigated the substrate versatility of the enzyme. X-ray and equilibrium binding data show that the aglycone DEO loosely fits the OleP active site, triggering the closure that prepares it for catalysis only on a minor population of enzyme. The open-to-closed state transition allows solvent molecules to accumulate in a cavity that forms upon closure, mediating protein-substrate interactions. In silico docking of the monoglycosylated L-O-DEO in the closed OleP-DEO structure shows that the L-olivosyl moiety can be hosted in the same cavity, replacing solvent molecules and directly contacting structural elements involved in the transition. X-ray structures of aglycone-bound OleP in the presence of L-rhamnose confirm the cavity as a potential site for sugar binding. All considered, we propose L-O-DEO as the optimal substrate of OleP, the L-olivosyl moiety possibly representing the molecular wedge that triggers a more efficient structural response upon substrate binding, favoring and stabilizing the enzyme closure before catalysis. OleP substrate versatility is supported by structural solvent molecules that compensate for the absence of a glycosyl unit when the aglycone is bound.
33036381/Do Connexin Mutants Cause Cataracts by Perturbing Glutathione Levels and Redox Metabolism in the Lens? Cataracts of many different etiologies are associated with oxidation of lens components. The lens is protected by maintenance of a pool of reduced glutathione (GSH) and other antioxidants. Because gap junction channels made of the lens connexins, Cx46 and Cx50, are permeable to GSH, we tested whether mice expressing two different mutants, Cx46fs380 and Cx50D47A, cause cataracts by impairing lens glutathione metabolism and facilitating oxidative damage. Levels of GSH were not reduced in homogenates of whole mutant lenses. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the GSSG/GSH ratio were increased in whole lenses of Cx50D47A, but not Cx46fs380 mice. The GSSG/GSH ratio was increased in the lens nucleus (but not cortex) of Cx46fs380 mice at 4.5 months of age, but it was not altered in younger animals. Carbonylated proteins were increased in Cx50D47A, but not Cx46fs380 lenses. Thus, both mouse lines have oxidizing lens environments, but oxidative modification is greater in Cx50D47A than in Cx46fs380 mice. The results suggest that GSH permeation through lens connexin channels is not a critical early event in cataract formation in these mice. Moreover, because oxidative damage was only detected in animals with significant cataracts, it cannot be an early event in their cataractogenesis.
33036339/Tailoring the Health-Promoting Potential of Protein Hydrolysate Derived from Fish Wastes and Flavonoids from Yellow Onion Skins: From Binding Mechanisms to Microencapsulated Functional Ingredients This study focuses on combining different bioprocessing tools in order to develop an in-depth engineering approach for enhancing the biological properties of two valuable food by-products, namely fish waste and yellow onion skins, in a single new bioactive formulation. Bone tissue from phytophagous carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) was used to obtain bioactive peptides through papain-assisted hydrolysis. The peptides with molecular weight lower than 3 kDa were characterized through MALDI-ToF/ToF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. As a prerequisite for microencapsulation, the ability of these peptides to bind the flavonoids extracted from yellow onion skins was further tested through fluorescence quenching measurements. The results obtained demonstrate a considerable binding potency with a binding value of 106 and also the presence of one single or one class of binding site during the interaction process of flavonoids with peptides, in which the main forces involved are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. In the freeze-drying microencapsulation process, an efficiency for total flavonoids of 88.68 +- 2.37% was obtained, considering the total flavonoids and total polyphenols from the powder of 75.72 +- 2.58 quercetin equivalents/g dry weight (DW) and 97.32 +- 2.80 gallic acid equivalents/g DW, respectively. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test on the L929 cell line cultivated in the presence of different concentrations of microencapsulated samples (0.05-1.5 mg/mL) proved no sign of cytotoxicity, the cell viability being over 80% for all the samples.
33477484/New Antineoplastic Naphthohydroquinones Attached to Labdane and Rearranged Diterpene Skeletons Terpenylquinones are mixed biogenesis primary or secondary metabolites widespread in Nature with many biological activities, including the antineoplastic cytotoxicity, that have inspired this work. Here, we present a cytotoxic structure-activity relationship of several diterpenylhydroquinone (DTHQ) derivatives, obtained from the natural labdane diterpenoid myrceocommunic acid used as starting material. Different structural modifications, that changed the functionality and stereochemistry of the decalin, have been implemented on the bicyclic core through epoxidation, ozonolysis or decarboxylation, and through induction of biomimetic breaks and rearrangements of the diterpene skeleton. All the isomers generated were completely characterized by spectroscopic procedures. The resulting compounds have been tested in vitro on cultured cancer cells, showing their relevant antineoplastic cytotoxicity, with GI50 values in the muM and sub-muM range. The rearranged compound 8 showed the best cytotoxic results, with GI50 at the submicromolar range, retaining the cytotoxicity level of the parent compounds. In this report, the versatility of the labdane skeleton for chemical transformation and the interest to continue using structural modifications to obtain new bioactive compounds are demonstrated.
33477482/Lipolytic Postbiotic from Lactobacillus paracasei Manages Metabolic Syndrome in Albino Wistar Rats The current study investigates the capacity of a lipolytic Lactobacillus paracasei postbiotic as a possible regulator for lipid metabolism by targeting metabolic syndrome as a possibly safer anti-obesity and Anti-dyslipidemia agent replacing atorvastatin (ATOR) and other drugs with proven or suspected health hazards. The high DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)] scavenging activity and high activities of antioxidant enzyme such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) of the Lactobacillus paracasei postbiotic (cell-free extract), coupled with considerable lipolytic activity, may support its action against metabolic syndrome. Lactobacillus paracasei isolate was obtained from an Egyptian cheese sample, identified and used for preparing the postbiotic. The postbiotic was characterized and administered to high-fat diet (HFD) albino rats (100 and 200 mg kg-1) for nine weeks, as compared to atorvastatin (ATOR; 10 mg kg-1). The postbiotic could correct the disruption in lipid metabolism and antioxidant enzymes in HFD rats more effectively than ATOR. The two levels of the postbiotic (100 and 200 mg kg-1) reduced total serum lipids by 29% and 34% and serum triglyceride by 32-45% of the positive control level, compared to only 25% and 35% in ATOR's case, respectively. Both ATOR and the postbiotic (200 mg kg-1) equally decreased total serum cholesterol by about 40% and 39%, while equally raising HDL levels by 28% and 30% of the positive control. The postbiotic counteracted HFD-induced body weight increases more effectively than ATOR without affecting liver and kidney functions or liver histopathology, at the optimal dose of each. The postbiotic is a safer substitute for ATOR in treating metabolic syndrome.
33477543/A Molecular Probe with Both Chromogenic and Fluorescent Units for Detecting Serine Proteases A molecular probe with l-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide and l-lysin 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, in which these amino acid derivatives are connected through a succinic-acid spacer, was prepared. Trypsin and papain were detected by blue-fluorescence emission of generated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). alpha-Chymotrypsin and nattokinase were detected from both the blue-fluorescence emission of AMC and the UV absorbance of p-nitroaniline. In addition, different time courses of p-nitroaniline and AMC were observed between the reaction of P1 with alpha-chymotrypsin and that with nattokinase. In the case of nattokinase, both the fluorescence emission and UV absorbance slowly increased. In contrast, the increasing UV absorbance was saturated at the early stage of the reaction of the present probe with chymotrypsin, whereas the fluorescence emission continuously increased in the following stages.
33477515/Fast and Sensitive Screening of Oxandrolone and Its Major Metabolite 17-Epi-Oxandrolone in Human Urine by UHPLC:MS/MS with On-Line SPE Sample Pretreatment Oxandrolone, a synthetic testosterone analog, is used for the treatment of several diseases associated with weight loss. Unfortunately, oxandrolone is abused by many athletes and bodybuilders due to its strong anabolic effect. We have developed and validated a highly sensitive and rapid on-line SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of oxandrolone and simultaneous identification of its major metabolite 17-epi-oxandrolone in urine matrices. Enrichment of the analytes via an integrated solid-phase extraction was achieved using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 Column. Subsequently, the chromatographic separation of the on-line preconcentrated sample fraction was achieved using an Acquity HSS T3 C18 Column. For the structural identification of these analytes, a high-resolution mass spectrometer Synapt-G2Si coupled to the Acquity M-class nano-LC system with ionKey source was used. A highly sensitive determination of oxandrolone was achieved using a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer XEVO TQD. The method was successfully validated in the linear range of oxandrolone from 81.63 pg mL-1 (limit of quantification, LOQ) to 5000 pg mL-1 in the human urine matrix. It was applied to the analysis of real urine samples obtained from a healthy volunteer after the oral administration of one dose (10 mg) of oxandrolone. Concentration vs. time dependence was tested in the time interval of 4 h-12 days (after oral administration) to demonstrate the ability of the method to detect the renal elimination of oxandrolone from the human body. Favorable performance parameters along with successful application indicate the usefulness of the proposed method for its routine use in antidoping control labs.
33477555/Improved Safety and Anti-Glioblastoma Efficacy of CAT3-Encapsulated SMEDDS through Metabolism Modification 13a-(S)-3-pivaloyloxyl-6,7-dimethoxyphenanthro(9,10-b)-indolizidine (CAT3) is a novel oral anti-glioma pro-drug with a potent anti-tumor effect against temozolomide-resistant glioma. 13a(S)-3-hydroxyl-6,7-dimethoxyphenanthro(9,10-b)-indolizidine (PF403) is the active in vivo lipase degradation metabolite of CAT3. Both CAT3 and PF403 can penetrate the blood-brain barrier to cause an anti-glioma effect. However, PF403, which is produced in the gastrointestinal tract and plasma, causes significant gastrointestinal side effects, limiting the clinical application of CAT3. The objective of this paper was to propose a metabolism modification for CAT3 using a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS), in order to reduce the generation of PF403 in the gastrointestinal tract and plasma, as well as increase the bioavailability of CAT3 in vivo and the amount of anti-tumor substances in the brain. Thus, a CAT3-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (CAT3-SMEDDS) was prepared, and its physicochemical characterization was systematically carried out. Next, the pharmacokinetic parameters of CAT3 and its metabolite in the rats' plasma and brain were measured. Furthermore, the in vivo anti-glioma effects and safety of CAT3-SMEDDS were evaluated. Finally, Caco-2 cell uptake, MDCK monolayer cellular transfer, and the intestinal lymphatic transport mechanisms of SMEDDS were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results show that CAT3-SMEDDS was able to form nanoemulsion droplets in artificial gastrointestinal fluid within 1 min, displaying an ideal particle size (15-30 nm), positive charge (5-9 mV), and controlled release behavior. CAT3-SMEDDS increased the membrane permeability of CAT3 by 3.9-fold and promoted intestinal lymphatic transport. Hence, the bioavailability of CAT3 was increased 79% and the level of its metabolite, PF403, was decreased to 49%. Moreover, the concentrations of CAT3 and PF403 were increased 2-6-fold and 1.3-7.2-fold, respectively, in the brain. Therefore, the anti-glioma effect in the orthotopic models was improved with CAT3-SMEDDS compared with CAT3 in 21 days. Additionally, CAT3-SMEDDS reduced the gastrointestinal side effects of CAT3, such as severe diarrhea, necrosis, and edema, and observed less inflammatory cell infiltration in the gastrointestinal tract, compared with the bare CAT3. Our work reveals that, through the metabolism modification effect, SMEDDS can improve the bioavailability of CAT3 and reduce the generation of PF403 in the gastrointestinal tract and plasma. Therefore, it has the potential to increase the anti-glioma effect and reduce the gastrointestinal side effects of CAT3 simultaneously.
33477558/Influence of Oxidative Stress on Time-Resolved Oxygen Detection by [Ru(Phen)3]2+ In Vivo and In Vitro Detection of tissue and cell oxygenation is of high importance in fundamental biological and in many medical applications, particularly for monitoring dysfunction in the early stages of cancer. Measurements of the luminescence lifetimes of molecular probes offer a very promising and non-invasive approach to estimate tissue and cell oxygenation in vivo and in vitro. We optimized the evaluation of oxygen detection in vivo by [Ru(Phen)3]2+ in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. Its luminescence lifetimes measured in the CAM were analyzed through hierarchical clustering. The detection of the tissue oxygenation at the oxidative stress conditions is still challenging. We applied simultaneous time-resolved recording of the mitochondrial probe MitoTrackerTM OrangeCMTMRos fluorescence and [Ru(Phen)3]2+ phosphorescence imaging in the intact cell without affecting the sensitivities of these molecular probes. [Ru(Phen)3]2+ was demonstrated to be suitable for in vitro detection of oxygen under various stress factors that mimic oxidative stress: other molecular sensors, H2O2, and curcumin-mediated photodynamic therapy in glioma cancer cells. Low phototoxicities of the molecular probes were finally observed. Our study offers a high potential for the application and generalization of tissue oxygenation as an innovative approach based on the similarities between interdependent biological influences. It is particularly suitable for therapeutic approaches targeting metabolic alterations as well as oxygen, glucose, or lipid deprivation.
33494773/Targeted eicosanoids profiling reveals a prostaglandin reprogramming in breast Cancer by microRNA-155 Abstract Background Prostaglandin is one of the key metabolites for inflammation-related carcinogenesis. Despite the microRNA-155 is implicated in various types of cancers, it's function in prostaglandin metabolism is largely unknown. Methods A targeted profiling of eicosanoids including prostaglandin, leukotriene and thromboxanes was performed in miR-155 deficient breast tumors and cancer cells. The molecular mechanism of miR-155-mediated prostaglandin reprogramming was investigated in primary and cancer cell lines, by analyzing key enzymes responsible for the prostaglandin production. Results We found miR-155-deficient breast tumors, plasma of tumor-bearing mouse and cancer cells show altered prostaglandin level, especially for the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Subsequent analysis in primary cancer cells, 20 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) specimens and breast cancer cell lines with miR-155 knockdown consistently showed a positive correlation between miR-155 level and PGE2/PGD2 ratio. Mechanistically, we reveal the miR-155 reprograms the prostaglandin metabolism by up-regulating PGE2-producing enzymes PTGES/PTGES2 while down-regulating PGD2-producing enzyme PTGDS. Further, we show the up-regulation of PTGES2 is driven by miR-155-cMYC axis, whereas PTGES is transactivated by miR-155-KLF4. Thus, miR-155 hires dual-regulatory mode for the metabolic enzyme expression to reprogram the PGE2/PGD2 balance. Lastly, we show the miR-155-driven cellular proliferation is restored by the siRNA of PTGES1/2, of which expression also significantly correlates with breast cancer patients' survival. Conclusions Considering clinical trials targeting PGE2 production largely have focused on the inhibition of Cox1 or Cox2 that showed cardiac toxicity, our data suggest an alternative way for suppressing PGE2 production via the inhibition of miR-155. As the antagomiR of miR-155 (MRG-106) underwent a phase-1 clinical trial, its effect should be considered and analyzed in prostaglandin metabolism in tumor.

33477620/Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Profiling Provide Novel Insights into Fruit Ripening and Ripening Disorder Caused by 1-MCP Treatments in Papaya Treatment with 1-methylcyclopropylene (1-MCP) is an effective technique to preserve fruits, but inappropriate treatment with 1-MCP causes a ripening disorder (rubbery texture) in papaya fruit. In this study, a combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis was conducted to reveal the possible mechanism of the ripening disorder caused by unsuitable 1-MCP in papaya. A total of 203 differential accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified in the metabolome analysis. Only 24 DAMs were identified in the control (CK) vs. the 1-MCP 2 h group, and they were primarily flavonoids. Ninety and 89 DAMs were identified in the CK vs. 1-MCP 16 h and 1-MCP 2 h vs. 1-MCP 16 h groups, respectively, indicating that long-term 1-MCP treatment severely altered the metabolites during fruit ripening. 1-MCP 16 h treatment severely reduced the number of metabolites, which primarily consisted of flavonoids, lipids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, and organic acids. An integrated analysis of RNA-Seq and metabolomics showed that various energy metabolites for the tricarboxylic acid cycle were reduced by long-term treatment with 1-MCP, and the glycolic acid cycle was the most significantly affected, as well as the phenylpropane pathway. These results provide valuable information for fruit quality control and new insight into the ripening disorder caused by unsuitable treatment with 1-MCP in papaya.
33477636/Quantitative Proteomics Reveals that GmENO2 Proteins Are Involved in Response to Phosphate Starvation in the Leaves of Glycine max L. Soybean (Glycine max L.) is a major crop providing important source for protein and oil for human life. Low phosphate (LP) availability is a critical limiting factor affecting soybean production. Soybean plants develop a series of strategies to adapt to phosphate (Pi) limitation condition. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for LP stress response remain largely unknown. Here, we performed a label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis of soybean leaves grown under low and high phosphate conditions. We identified 267 induced and 440 reduced differential proteins from phosphate-starved leaves. Almost a quarter of the LP decreased proteins are involved in translation processes, while the LP increased proteins are accumulated in chlorophyll biosynthetic and carbon metabolic processes. Among these induced proteins, an enolase protein, GmENO2a was found to be mostly induced protein. On the transcriptional level, GmENO2a and GmENO2b, but not GmENO2c or GmENO2d, were dramatically induced by phosphate starvation. Among 14 enolase genes, only GmENO2a and GmENO2b genes contain the P1BS motif in their promoter regions. Furthermore, GmENO2b was specifically induced in the GmPHR31 overexpressing soybean plants. Our findings provide molecular insights into how soybean plants tune basic carbon metabolic pathway to adapt to Pi deprivation through the ENO2 enzymes.
33477697/ZnII and CuII-Based Coordination Polymers and Metal Organic Frameworks by the of Use of 2-Pyridyl Oximes and 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic Acid The simultaneous use of 2-pyridyl oximes (pyridine-2 amidoxime, H2pyaox; 2-methyl pyridyl ketoxime, Hmpko) and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3btc) provided access to five new compounds, namely [Zn(H2btc)2(H2pyaox)2] 2H2O (1 2H2O), [Zn(Hbtc)(H2pyaox)2]n (2), [Cu(Hbtc)(H2pyaox)]n (3), [Cu(Hbtc)(HmpKo)]n (4) and [Cu2(Hbtc)2(Hmpko)2(H2O)2] 4H2O (5 4H2O). Among them, 3 is the first example of a metal-organic framework (MOF) containing H2pyaox. Its framework can be described as a 3-c uninodal net of hcb topology with the layers being parallel to the (1,0,1) plane. Furthermore, 3 is the third reported MOF based on a 2-pyridyl oxime in general. 2 and 4 are new members of a small family of coordination polymers containing an oximic ligand. 1-5 form 3D networks through strong intermolecular interactions. Dc magnetic susceptibility studies were carried out in a crystalline sample of 3 and revealed the presence of weak exchange interactions between the metal centres; the experimental data were fitted to a theoretical model with the fitting parameters being J = -0.16(1) cm-1 and g = 2.085(1). The isotropic g value was also confirmed by electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Reactivity studies were performed for 3 in the presence of metal ions; the reaction progress was studied and discussed for Fe(NO3)3 by the use of several characterization techniques, including single crystal X-ray crystallography and IR spectroscopy.
33477703/Achiral Molecular Recognition of Substituted Aniline Position Isomers by Crown Ether Type Chiral Stationary Phase To understand the selectivity of the crown ether type chiral stationary phase (CSP), the retention selectivity for aniline and the positional isomers of substituted anilines were studied. In various substituted isomers, except nitroaniline, a remarkable decrease of retention due to steric hindrance was observed for the 2-substituted isomer. To determine the detailed molecular recognition mechanism, quantum chemical calculations were performed for the aggregates between the crown ether and the anilines. The results suggested that the 20-Crown-6, which includes a phenyl-substituted 1,1'-binaphthyl moiety, interacts with alkyl and aryl amines in an unconventional form different from the proposed one for 18-Crown-6.
33477696/Nail Melatonin Content: A Suitable Non-Invasive Marker of Melatonin Production Melatonin plays multiple physiological roles in the human body. Evaluation of melatonin production by the determination of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in 24-h samples has important drawbacks which hinder the successful evaluation of melatonin production in large cohorts. Here, we evaluated the potential of nail analysis for estimating melatonin production. Firstly, mass spectrometry methodology for the determination of melatonin in nails was optimized and successfully validated. The method was found to be linear in the range 6.5-830 fg/mg with intraday and interday accuracy in the range 100-104 %, precision below 15 % and a LOD of 3.5 fg/mg. Secondly, nail melatonin concentrations from 84 volunteers (age 5-96) were determined. The expected correlation between melatonin and age was obtained (correlation coefficient -0.615; p < 0.001). Additionally, we showed that fingernails are preferable to toenails to determine nail melatonin content. Finally, fingernails collected for 180 days after melatonin administration (two volunteers, 1.9 mg/night during 5 days) were analyzed. Nail melatonin concentrations immediately rose after administration and went back to pre-administration values after  100 days in both volunteers. Our results suggest that melatonin determination in nails is a suitable non-invasive tool for the estimation of global melatonin production. Due to the easy collection and storage of nails, the long-term information obtained and the multiple functions of melatonin, nail melatonin content might complement dim light melatonin onset, which is commonly measured from plasma/saliva samples, paving the way for melatonin research.
33477686/Chiral Tertiary Amine Catalyzed Asymmetric [4 + 2] Cyclization of 3-Aroylcoumarines with 2,3-Butadienoate Coumarins and 2H-pyran derivatives are among the most commonly found structural units in natural products. Therefore, the introduction of 2H-pyran moiety into the coumarin structural unit, i.e., dihydrocoumarin-fused dihydropyranones, is a potentially successful route for the identification of novel bioactive structures, and the synthesis of these structures has attracted continuing research interest. Herein, a chiral tertiary amine catalyzed [4 + 2] cyclization of 3-aroylcoumarines with benzyl 2,3-butadienoate was reported. In the presence of Kumar's 6'-(4-biphenyl)-beta-iso-cinchonine, the desired dihydrocoumarin-fused dihydropyranone products could be obtained in up to 97% yield and 90% ee values.
33477684/Effects of Alzheimer-Like Pathology on Homocysteine and Homocysteic Acid Levels:An Exploratory In Vivo Kinetic Study Hyperhomocysteinemia has been suggested potentially to contribute to a variety of pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia on AD has been investigated extensively, there are scarce data on the effect of AD on hyperhomocysteinemia. The aim of this in vivo study was to investigate the kinetics of homocysteine (HCys) and homocysteic acid (HCA) and effects of AD-like pathology on the endogenous levels. The mice received a B-vitamin deficient diet for eight weeks, followed by the return to a balanced control diet for another eight weeks. Serum, urine, and brain tissues of AppNL-G-F knock-in and C57BL/6J wild type mice were analyzed for HCys and HCA using LC-MS/MS methods. Hyperhomocysteinemic levels were found in wild type and knock-in mice due to the consumption of the deficient diet for eight weeks, followed by a rapid normalization of the levels after the return to control chow. Hyperhomocysteinemic AppNL-G-F mice had significantly higher HCys in all matrices, but not HCA, compared to wild type control. Higher serum concentrations were associated with elevated levels in both the brain and in urine. Our findings confirm a significant impact of AD-like pathology on hyperhomocysteinemia in the AppNL-G-F mouse model. The immediate normalization of HCys and HCA after the supply of B-vitamins strengthens the idea of a B-vitamin intervention as a potentially preventive treatment option for HCys-related disorders such as AD.
33477662/Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory and Antidiabetic Proprieties of LC-MS/MS Identified Polyphenols from Coriander Seeds Coriandrum sativum L. seeds are traditionally used to treat diabetes and its complications (inflammation and formation of reactive oxygen species) around the world. The present study investigates the antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects of the polyphenol fraction of Coriandrum sativum seeds (PCS). Diabetic mice were orally administered with PCS (25 and 50 mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days. Oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) was also evaluated along with the anti-inflammatory effect, assessed by measuring paw edema development induced with carrageenan in Wistar rat and the antioxidant activity assessed using two tests (beta-carotene discoloration and DPPH). Treatment of diabetic mice with PCS for four weeks managed their high fasting blood glucose levels, improved their overall health, also revealed an excellent antihyperlipidemic activity. The OGTT result showed a potent antihyperglycemic activity, and following the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, the PCS exhibited a perfect activity. LC-MS/MS result revealed the presence of 9 polyphenols. This modest work indicates that the PCS have an important antidiabetic, antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effect that can be well established treatment of diabetes and its complications.
33477705/Flavonoid Glycosides in Brassica Species Respond to UV-B Depending on Exposure Time and Adaptation Time Recently, there have been efforts to use ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) as a biotechnological tool in greenhouses. Leafy Brassica species are mainly considered for their ability to synthesize glucosinolates and are valued as baby salads. They also have a remarkable concentration of chemically diverse flavonoid glycosides. In this study, the effect of short-term UV-B radiation at the end of the production cycle was investigated without affecting plant growth. The aim was to verify which exposure and adaptation time was suitable and needs to be further investigated to use UV as a biotechnological tool in greenhouse production of Brassica species. It is possible to modify the flavonoid glycoside profile of leafy Brassica species by increasing compounds that appear to have potentially high antioxidant activity. Exemplarily, the present experiment shows that kaempferol glycosides may be preferred over quercetin glycosides in response to UV-B in Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis, for example, whereas other species appear to prefer quercetin glycosides over kaempferol glycosides, such as Brassica oleracea var. sabellica or Brassica carinata. However, the response to short-term UV-B treatment is species-specific and conclusions on exposure and adaptation time cannot be unified but must be drawn separately for each species.
33477743/Antiparasitic Potential of Chromatographic Fractions of Nephrolepis biserrata and Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight-Mass Spectrometry Analysis Marine aquaculture development is recently impeded by parasitic leech Zeylanicobdella arugamensis (Hirudinea, Piscicolidae) in Sabah, Malaysia. The parasitic leech infests a variety of cultured fishes in aquaculture facilities. In this study, we evaluated the antiparasitic activity of the chromatographic fractions of the medicinal plant Nephrolepis biserrata methanol extract against Z. arugamensis and highlighted the potential metabolites responsible for the antiparasitic properties through liquid chromatography (LC)-quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Out of seven fractions obtained through flash column chromatography techniques, three fractions demonstrated antiparasitic properties. Significant parasitic mortality was indicated by fraction 3 at a concentration of 2.50 mg/mL, all the leeches were killed in a time limit of 1.92 +- 0.59 min. followed by fraction 4 (14 mg/mL) in 34.57 +- 3.39 and fraction 5 (15.3 mg/mL) in 36.82 +- 4.53 min. LC-QTOF-MS analysis indicated the presence of secondary metabolites including phytosphingosine (6), pyrethrosin (1), haplophytine (9), ivalin (2), warburganal (3), isodomedin (4) and pheophorbide a (16), representing sphingoid, alkaloid, terpenoid, phenolic and flavonoid groups. Thus, our study indicated that the chromatographic fractions of N. biserrata demonstrated significant antiparasitic activity against the marine parasitic leeches due to the presence of potent antiparasitic bioactive compounds.
33477727/Enhancing the Physiochemical Properties of Puerarin via L-Proline Co-Crystallization: Synthesis, Characterization, and Dissolution Studies of Two Phases of Pharmaceutical Co-Crystals Puerarin (PUE) is a Chinese traditional medicine known to enhance glucose uptake into the insulin cells to downregulate the blood glucose levels in the treatment of type II diabetes. Nevertheless, the bioavailability of pristine PUE is limited due to its poor solubility and low intestinal permeability. In this work, we demonstrate that the solubility of PUE can be significantly enhanced via its co-crystallization with L-Proline (PRO). Two crystalline phases, namely, the solvate-free form [PUE][PRO] (I) and the solvated form [PUE]2[PRO] EtOH (H2O)2 (II) are isolated. These two phases are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis in association with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC). The solubility and dissolution rate of both I and II in water, gastrointestinal tract at pH 1.2, and phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 indicates a nearly doubled increase as compared to the pristine PUE. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay of pristine PUE, I and II against murine colon cancer cell lines CT-26 and human kidney cell lines HEK-293 indicated that neither compound exhibits obvious cytotoxicity after 24 h. This work showcases that the readily available and biocompatible PRO can be a promising adjuvant to enhance the physicochemical properties of PUE toward orally administered drug formulation with improved pharmacokinetics.
33477837/Mechanisms of Dietary Sodium-Induced Impairments in Endothelial Function and Potential Countermeasures Despite decades of efforts to reduce sodium intake, excess dietary sodium remains commonplace, and contributes to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality independent of its effects on blood pressure. An increasing amount of research suggests that high-sodium diets lead to reduced nitric oxide-mediated endothelial function, even in the absence of a change in blood pressure. As endothelial dysfunction is an early step in the progression of cardiovascular diseases, the endothelium presents a target for interventions aimed at reducing the impact of excess dietary sodium. In this review, we briefly define endothelial function and present the literature demonstrating that excess dietary sodium results in impaired endothelial function. We then discuss the mechanisms through which sodium impairs the endothelium, including increased reactive oxygen species, decreased intrinsic antioxidant defenses, endothelial cell stiffening, and damage to the endothelial glycocalyx. Finally, we present selected research findings suggesting that aerobic exercise or increased intake of dietary potassium may counteract the deleterious vascular effects of a high-sodium diet.
33477824/Higher Intakes of Potassium and Magnesium, but Not Lower Sodium, Reduce Cardiovascular Risk in the Framingham Offspring Study We explored the dose-response relations of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the Framingham Offspring Study, as well as the combined effects of these minerals. Analyses included 2362 30-64 year-old men and women free of CVD at baseline. Cox proportional-hazards models were used estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mineral intakes and incident CVD. Cox models with restricted cubic spline functions were used to examine dose-response relations, adjusting for confounding by age, sex, body mass index, dietary fiber intake, and time-varying occurrence of hypertension. Lower sodium intake (<2500 vs. >=3500 mg/d) was not associated with a lower risk of CVD. In contrast, potassium intake >=3000 (vs. <2500) mg/d was associated with a 25% lower risk (95% CI: 0.59, 0.95), while magnesium intake >=320 (vs. <240) mg/d led to a 34% lower risk (95% CI: 0.51, 0.87) of CVD. Calcium intake >=700 (vs. <500) mg/d was associated with a non-statistically significant 19% lower risk. Restricted cubic spline curves showed inverse dose-response relations of potassium and magnesium with CVD risk, but no such associations were observed for sodium or calcium. These results highlight the importance of potassium and magnesium to cardiovascular health.
33477841/Analyzing the Carotenoid Composition of Melilot (Melilotus officinalis (L.) Pall.) Extracts and the Effects of Isolated (All-E)-lutein-5,6-epoxide on Primary Sensory Neurons and Macrophages Melilotus officinalis is known to contain several types of secondary metabolites. In contrast, the carotenoid composition of this medicinal plant has not been investigated, although it may also contribute to the biological activities of the drug, such as anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, this study focuses on the isolation and identification of carotenoids from Meliloti herba and on the effect of isolated (all-E)-lutein 5,6-epoxide on primary sensory neurons and macrophages involved in nociception, as well as neurogenic and non-neurogenic inflammatory processes. The composition of the plant extracts was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The main carotenoid was isolated by column liquid chromatography (CLC) and identified by MS and NMR. The effect of water-soluble lutein 5,6-epoxide-RAMEB (randomly methylated-beta-cyclodextrin) was investigated on Ca2+-influx in rat primary sensory neurons induced by the activation of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 receptor agonist to mustard-oil and on endotoxin-induced IL-1beta release from isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages. (all-E)-Lutein 5,6-epoxide significantly decreased the percent of responsive primary sensory neurons compared to the vehicle-treated stimulated control. Furthermore, endotoxin-evoked IL-1beta release from macrophages was significantly decreased by 100 microM lutein 5,6-epoxide compared to the vehicle-treated control. The water-soluble form of lutein 5,6-epoxide-RAMEB decreases the activation of primary sensory neurons and macrophages, which opens perspectives for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory applications.
33472443/Ocular lamellar crystalline gels for sustained release and enhanced permeation of resveratrol against corneal neovascularization Abstract Corneal neovascularization (CNV) is the major cause of blindness after eye injury; however, only several drugs can be applied and the invasive administration ways (i.e., intravitreal injection and subconjunctival injection) are used. Resveratrol is a highly effective anti-VEGF agent against CNV. However, its applications are limited due to its strong hydrophobicity and instability. Here, we developed a resveratrol-loaded ocular lamellar crystalline gel (ROLG) for high inhibition of CNV. ROLGs were composed of resveratrol, glyceryl monooleate (GMO), ethanol, and water, and their lamellar crystalline structures were identified by polarizing light microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. High drug loading (4.4 mg/g) of ROLGs was achieved due to the hydrogen bonding between GMO and resveratrol. Resveratrol showed sustained release with 67% accumulative release in 7 h, which was attributed to the slow erosion of gels. Resveratrol in ROLGs had a high corneal permeation 3 times higher than resveratrol in hyaluronic acid suspensions (RHSs). ROLGs were administered to rats only once a day because of their strong retention on the cornea surface. ROLGs were safe due to the very little contact of ethanol in ROLGs to the cornea. CNV post-rat corneal alkaline injury was highly inhibited by ROLGs, resulting from the attenuation of corneal VEGF expression and then corneal healing was improved. The ROLG was a promising ocular medicine for the prevention of CNV.
33493155/Elevated serum 4HNE plus decreased serum thioredoxin: Unique feature and implications for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a global problem with high mortality. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood. To reveal new serum feature of AECOPD and their potential implications, we have analyzed 180 serum samples, and found that in the serum of AECOPD patients, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adducts are dynamically increased as partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) drops, which is accompanied by progressively decreasing thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and thioredoxin (Trx1), as compared with those of healthy people. This phenomenon is unique, because acute hypoxia patients have 1.1-fold or 1.7-fold higher serum TrxR1 or Trx1 activity, respectively, than healthy people, in keeping with low 4HNE level. Moreover, serum 4HNE-protein adducts may form disulfide-linked complexes with high-molecular-weight, the amount of which is significantly increased during AECOPD. Serum 4HNE-protein adducts include 4HNE-Trx1 adduct and 4HNE-TrxR1 adduct, but only the former is significantly increased during AECOPD. Through cell biology, biochemistry and proteomics methods, we have demonstrated that extracellular 4HNE and 4HNE-Trx1 adduct affect human bronchial epithelial cells via different mechanisms. 4HNE-Trx1 adduct may significantly alter the expression of proteins involved mainly in RNA metabolism, but it has no effect on TrxR1/Trx1 expression and cell viability. On the other hand, low levels of 4HNE promote TrxR1/Trx1 expression and cell viability, while high levels of 4HNE inhibit TrxR1/Trx1 expression and cell viability, during which Trx1, at least in part, mediate the 4HNE action. Our data suggest that increasing serum 4HNE and decreasing serum Trx1 in AECOPD patients are closely related to the pathological processes of the disease. This finding also provides a new basis for AECOPD patients to use antioxidant drugs.
33477894/Polyphenols and Human Health: The Role of Bioavailability Polyphenols are a group of phytochemicals with potential health-promoting effects. They are classified as flavonoid (flavonols, flavanols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, and anthocyanins) and non-flavonoid molecules (phenolic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, lignans, stilbenes, and tannins). Although an increasing number of trials have shown a correlation among polyphenol consumption and a reduction in risk factors for chronic diseases, discrepancies in explaining their positive effects have been found in terms of the bioavailability. In fact, polyphenols show a low bioavailability due to several factors: interaction with the food matrix, the metabolic processes mediated by the liver (phase I and II metabolism), intestine and microbiota. On the other hand, the biological activities of phenol compounds may be mediated by their metabolites, which are produced in vivo, and recent studies have confirmed that these molecules may have antioxidant and anti-phlogistic properties. This review discusses the studies performed in vivo, which consider the polyphenol bioavailability and their different food sources. Factors influencing the biological effects of the main classes of polyphenols are also considered.
33477918/Ellagic Acid-Cyclodextrin Complexes for the Treatment of Oral Candidiasis The increase in the prevalence of fungal infections worldwide and the rise in the occurrence of antifungal resistance suggest that new research to discover antifungal molecules is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of ellagic acid-cyclodextrin complexes (EA/HP-beta-CD) for the treatment of oral candidiasis. First, the effect of EA/HP-beta-CD on C. albicans planktonic cells and biofilms was evaluated. Then, the cytotoxicity of the effective concentration was studied to ensure safety of in vivo testing. Finally, the in vivo effectiveness was determined by using a murine model of induced oral candidiasis. Data was statistically analyzed. The minimal inhibitory concentration of EA/HP-beta-CD was 25 microg/mL and a concentration of 10 times MIC (250 microg/mL) showed an inhibitory effect on C. albicans 48 h-biofilms. The complex at concentration 250 microg/mL was classified as slightly cytotoxic. In vivo experiments showed a reduction in fungal epithelial invasion after treatment with EA/HP-beta-CD for 24 h and 96 h when compared to the negative control. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that EA/HP-beta-CD has antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the invasive capacity of C. albicans, which suggests that EA/HP-beta-CD may be a promising alternative for the treatment of oral candidiasis.
33532039/P2X7 Receptor Induces Pyroptotic Inflammation and Cartilage Degradation in Osteoarthritis via NF-kappaB/NLRP3 Crosstalk Osteoarthritis (OA) is an urgent public health problem; however, the underlying causal mechanisms remain unclear, especially in terms of inflammatory mediators in cartilage degradation and chondrocyte imbalance. P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is a critical inflammation switch, but few studies have examined its function and mechanisms in OA-like pyroptotic inflammation of chondrocytes. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in the knee with monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) to induce OA, followed by multiple intra-articular injections with P2X7R antagonist A740003, P2X7R agonist BzATP, NF-kappaB inhibitor Bay 11-7082, and NLRP3 inhibitor CY-09. Primary rat chondrocytes were harvested and treated similarly. We assessed cell viability, damage, and death via cell viability assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and flow cytometry. Concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and interleukin- (IL-) 1beta in cell culture supernatant and joint cavity lavage fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Changes in expression levels of P2X7 and inflammation-related indicators were analyzed by immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. Cell morphology changes and pyroptosis were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and microcomputed tomography were used to analyze damage to bone and cartilage tissues and assess the severity of OA. Similar to MIA, BzATP reduced cell viability and collagen II expression in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, A740003 ameliorated MIA-induced cartilage degradation and OA-like pyroptotic inflammation by rescuing P2X7, MMP13, NF-kappaB p65, NLRP3, caspase-1 (TUNEL-positive and active), and IL-1beta upregulation. Additionally, A740003 reduced the caspase-1/propidium iodide double-positive rate, LDH concentration, and reactive oxygen species production. These effects also occurred via coincubation with Bay 11-7082 and CY-09. In conclusion, activated P2X7 promoted extracellular matrix degradation and pyroptotic inflammation in OA chondrocytes through NF-kappaB/NLRP3 crosstalk, thus, aggravating the symptoms of OA. The study findings suggest P2X7 as a potential target for inflammation treatment, providing new avenues for OA research and therapy.
33478008/Mechanical Stress Induces Ca2+-Dependent Signal Transduction in Erythroblasts and Modulates Erythropoiesis Bioreactors are increasingly implemented for large scale cultures of various mammalian cells, which requires optimization of culture conditions. Such upscaling is also required to produce red blood cells (RBC) for transfusion and therapy purposes. However, the physiological suitability of RBC cultures to be transferred to stirred bioreactors is not well understood. PIEZO1 is the most abundantly expressed known mechanosensor on erythroid cells. It is a cation channel that translates mechanical forces directly into a physiological response. We investigated signaling cascades downstream of PIEZO1 activated upon transitioning stationary cultures to orbital shaking associated with mechanical stress, and compared the results to direct activation of PIEZO1 by the chemical agonist Yoda1. Erythroblasts subjected to orbital shaking displayed decreased proliferation, comparable to incubation in the presence of a low dose of Yoda1. Epo (Erythropoietin)-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation, and Calcineurin-dependent NFAT dephosphorylation was enhanced. Phosphorylation of ERK was also induced by both orbital shaking and Yoda1 treatment. Activation of these pathways was inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ chelation (BAPTA-AM) in the orbital shaker. Our results suggest that PIEZO1 is functional and could be activated by the mechanical forces in a bioreactor setup, and results in the induction of Ca2+-dependent signaling cascades regulating various aspects of erythropoiesis. With this study, we showed that Yoda1 treatment and mechanical stress induced via orbital shaking results in comparable activation of some Ca2+-dependent pathways, exhibiting that there are direct physiological outcomes of mechanical stress on erythroblasts.
33478151/Structural Reorganization of Imidazolium Ionic Liquids Induced by Pressure-Enhanced Ionic Liquid:Polyethylene Oxide Interactions Mixtures of polyethylene oxide (PEO, M.W.~900,000) and imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) are studied using high-pressure Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. At ambient pressure, the spectral features in the C-H stretching region reveal that PEO can disturb the local structures of the imidazolium rings of [BMIM]+ and [HMIM]+. The pressure-induced phase transition of pure 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([BMIM]Br) is observed at a pressure of 0.4 GPa. Pressure-enhanced [BMIM]Br-PEO interactions may assist PEO in dividing [BMIM]Br clusters to hinder the aggregation of [BMIM]Br under high pressures. The C-H absorptions of pure 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide [HMIM]Br do not show band narrowing under high pressures, as observed for pure [BMIM]Br. The band narrowing of C-H peaks is observed at 1.5 GPa for the [HMIM]Br-PEO mixture containing 80 wt% of [HMIM]Br. The presence of PEO may reorganize [HMIM]Br clusters into a semi-crystalline network under high pressures. The differences in aggregation states for ambient-pressure phase and high-pressure phase may suggest the potential of [HMIM]Br-PEO (M.W.~900,000) for serving as optical or electronic switches.
33478076/Evaluation of Fluorescent Cu2+ Probes: Instant Sensing, Cell Permeable Recognition and Quantitative Detection By incorporating a rhodamine spirolactam structure as the recognition site for Cu2+, two novel probes were synthesized through a connection of rhodamine 6G acylhydrazine and 5-formyl-6-hydroxyl-4-methylcoumarin/2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. In the recognition process of probes towards Cu2+, the spirolactam ring exhibited opening and closing, accompanying an instant and specific change in fluorescence and in color, which could also achieve a naked-eye and semiquantitative recognition of aqueous Cu2+ besides the fluorescent Cu2+ detection method. Fluorescent analyses and ECV304 cell imaging further revealed the probes' good optical stability, instant response, low toxicity, and membrane permeability, which offers future possibilities for the probes' instant detection and the real-time tracking of Cu2+ in biological systems.
33478045/Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulfide by Quinones: How Polyphenols Initiate Their Cytoprotective Effects We have shown that autoxidized polyphenolic nutraceuticals oxidize H2S to polysulfides and thiosulfate and this may convey their cytoprotective effects. Polyphenol reactivity is largely attributed to the B ring, which is usually a form of hydroxyquinone (HQ). Here, we examine the effects of HQs on sulfur metabolism using H2S- and polysulfide-specific fluorophores (AzMC and SSP4, respectively) and thiosulfate sensitive silver nanoparticles (AgNP). In buffer, 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (1,4-DB), 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ), pyrogallol (PG) and gallic acid (GA) oxidized H2S to polysulfides and thiosulfate, whereas 1,2-DB, 1,3-DB, 1,2-dihydroxy,3,4-benzoquinone and shikimic acid did not. In addition, 1,4-DB, 1,4-BQ, PG and GA also increased polysulfide production in HEK293 cells. In buffer, H2S oxidation by 1,4-DB was oxygen-dependent, partially inhibited by tempol and trolox, and absorbance spectra were consistent with redox cycling between HQ autoxidation and H2S-mediated reduction. Neither 1,2-DB, 1,3-DB, 1,4-DB nor 1,4-BQ reduced polysulfides to H2S in either 21% or 0% oxygen. Epinephrine and norepinephrine also oxidized H2S to polysulfides and thiosulfate; dopamine and tyrosine were ineffective. Polyphenones were also examined, but only 2,5-dihydroxy- and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenones oxidized H2S. These results show that H2S is readily oxidized by specific hydroxyquinones and quinones, most likely through the formation of a semiquinone radical intermediate derived from either reaction of oxygen with the reduced quinones, or from direct reaction between H2S and quinones. We propose that polysulfide production by these reactions contributes to the health-promoting benefits of polyphenolic nutraceuticals.
33477958/Defining the Cell Wall, Cell Cycle and Chromatin Landmarks in the Responses of Brachypodium distachyon to Salinity Excess salinity is a major stress that limits crop yields. Here, we used the model grass Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) reference line Bd21 in order to define the key molecular events in the responses to salt during germination. Salt was applied either throughout the germination period ("salt stress") or only after root emergence ("salt shock"). Germination was affected at >=100 mM and root elongation at >=75 mM NaCl. The expression of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), FLA1, FLA10, FLA11, AGP20 and AGP26, which regulate cell wall expansion (especially FLA11), were mostly induced by the "salt stress" but to a lesser extent by "salt shock". Cytological assessment using two AGP epitopes, JIM8 and JIM13 indicated that "salt stress" increases the fluorescence signals in rhizodermal and exodermal cell wall. Cell division was suppressed at >75 mM NaCl. The cell cycle genes (CDKB1, CDKB2, CYCA3, CYCB1, WEE1) were induced by "salt stress" in a concentration-dependent manner but not CDKA, CYCA and CYCLIN-D4-1-RELATED. Under "salt shock", the cell cycle genes were optimally expressed at 100 mM NaCl. These changes were consistent with the cell cycle arrest, possibly at the G1 phase. The salt-induced genomic damage was linked with the oxidative events via an increased glutathione accumulation. Histone acetylation and methylation and DNA methylation were visualized by immunofluorescence. Histone H4 acetylation at lysine 5 increased strongly whereas DNA methylation decreased with the application of salt. Taken together, we suggest that salt-induced oxidative stress causes genomic damage but that it also has epigenetic effects, which might modulate the cell cycle and AGP expression gene. Based on these landmarks, we aim to encourage functional genomics studies on the responses of Brachypodium to salt.
33478000/The Association between Serum Vitamin D Levels and Helicobacter pylori Presence and Eradication Background: The success of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication depends on several host and treatment factors. Serum vitamin D levels may be associated with H. pylori infection and eradication rates. We investigated the association between vitamin D and H. pylori infection and eradication, using a large electronic database based on medical records from a population-based health maintenance organization. Methods: Data regarding adults who underwent H. pylori testing and had vitamin D measurements within one month of H. pylori testing were collected. H. pylori infection was ascertained using urea breath or stool antigen tests. A negative H. pylori test following a positive result implied eradication. Multivariate regression models were constructed to assess associations between H. pylori infection, eradication, and vitamin D. Results: Among 150,483 members who underwent H. pylori testing from 2009 to 2018, 27,077 (18%) had vitamin D measurements. Vitamin D levels were inversely associated with H. pylori infection, p < 0.001. The odds of a positive H. pylori test were 31% higher among patients with vitamin D levels <20 ng/mL, compared with those with levels >=20 ng/mL (OR 1.31, 99% CI 1.22-1.4, p < 0.001). Purchase of vitamin D supplements was associated with a negative subsequent H. pylori test (p < 0.001). Mean vitamin D levels were moderately higher in those with successful vs. failed H. pylori eradication (19.34 +- 9.55 vs. 18.64 +- 9.61, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Vitamin D levels are associated with H. pylori infection. Increased vitamin D levels are associated with successful H. pylori eradication. Vitamin D may have a role in H. pylori eradication.
33478062/The Bioavailability, Extraction, Biosynthesis and Distribution of Natural Dihydrochalcone: Phloridzin Phloridzin is an important phytochemical which was first isolated from the bark of apple trees. It is a member of the dihydrochalcones and mainly distributed in the plants of the Malus genus, therefore, the extraction method of phloridzin was similar to those of other phenolic substances. High-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC), resin adsorption technology and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to separate and purify phloridzin. Many studies showed that phloridzin had multiple pharmacological effects, such as antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, anticancer and antibacterial activities. Besides, the physiological activities of phloridzin are cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, antiobesity, antioxidant and so on. The present review summarizes the biosynthesis, distribution, extraction and bioavailability of the natural compound phloridzin and discusses its applications in food and medicine.
33477960/An In Vivo Study of a Rat Fluid-Percussion-Induced Traumatic Brain Injury Model with [11C]PBR28 and [18F]flumazenil PET Imaging Traumatic brain injury (TBI) modelled by lateral fluid percussion-induction (LFPI) in rats is a widely used experimental rodent model to explore and understand the underlying cellular and molecular alterations in the brain caused by TBI in humans. Current improvements in imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) have made it possible to map certain features of TBI-induced cellular and molecular changes equally in humans and animals. The PET imaging technique is an apt supplement to nanotheranostic-based treatment alternatives that are emerging to tackle TBI. The present study aims to investigate whether the two radioligands, [11C]PBR28 and [18F]flumazenil, are able to accurately quantify in vivo molecular-cellular changes in a rodent TBI-model for two different biochemical targets of the processes. In addition, it serves to observe any palpable variations associated with primary and secondary injury sites, and in the affected versus the contralateral hemispheres. As [11C]PBR28 is a radioligand of the 18 kD translocator protein, the up-regulation of which is coupled to the level of neuroinflammation in the brain, and [18F]flumazenil is a radioligand for GABAA-benzodiazepine receptors, whose level mirrors interneuronal activity and eventually cell death, the use of the two radioligands may reveal two critical features of TBI. An up-regulation in the [11C]PBR28 uptake triggered by the LFP in the injured (right) hemisphere was noted on day 14, while the uptake of [18F]flumazenil was down-regulated on day 14. When comparing the left (contralateral) and right (LFPI) hemispheres, the differences between the two in neuroinflammation were obvious. Our results demonstrate a potential way to measure the molecular alterations in a rodent-based TBI model using PET imaging with [11C]PBR28 and [18F]flumazenil. These radioligands are promising options that can be eventually used in exploring the complex in vivo pharmacokinetics and delivery mechanisms of nanoparticles in TBI treatment.
33477997/Revealing the Potential Application of EC-Synthetic Retinoid Analogues in Anticancer Therapy (1) Background and Aim: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces differentiation and inhibits growth of many cancer cells. However, resistance develops rapidly prompting the urgent need for new synthetic and potent derivatives. EC19 and EC23 are two synthetic retinoids with potent stem cell neuro-differentiation activity. Here, these compounds were screened for their in vitro antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity using an array of different cancer cell lines. (2) Methods: MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, AV/PI (annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI)), cell cycle analysis, immunocytochemistry, gene expression analysis, Western blotting, measurement of glutamate and total antioxidant concentrations were recruited. (3) Results: HepG2, Caco-2, and MCF-7 were the most sensitive cell lines; HepG2 (ATRA; 36.2, EC19; 42.2 and EC23; 0.74 microM), Caco-2 (ATRA; 58.0, EC19; 10.8 and EC23; 14.7 microM) and MCF-7 (ATRA; 99.0, EC19; 9.4 and EC23; 5.56 microM). Caco-2 cells were selected for further biochemical investigations. Isobologram analysis revealed the combined synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil with substantial reduction in IC50. All retinoids induced apoptosis but EC19 had higher potency, with significant cell cycle arrest at subG0-G1, -S and G2/M phases, than ATRA and EC23. Moreover, EC19 reduced cellular metastasis in a transwell invasion assay due to overexpression of E-cadherin, retinoic acid-induced 2 (RAI2) and Werner (WRN) genes. (4) Conclusion: The present study suggests that EC-synthetic retinoids, particularly EC19, can be effective, alone or in combinations, for potential anticancer activity to colorectal cancer. Further in vivo studies are recommended to pave the way for clinical applications.
33478156/Simultaneous Determination of Cortisol, Cortisone, and Multiple Illicit Drugs in Hair among Female Drug Addicts with LC-MS/MS Long-term dependence of illicit drugs impairs the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the secretion of endogenous steroids, cortisol, and cortisone. Thus, the present study aimed to develop a sensitive method for simultaneous determination of the multiple illicit drugs and two steroids in hair to monitor the status of illicit drug exposure and the physiological and psychological health of drug addicts. The target analytes were extracted from hair by incubation with 1 mL methanol for 24 h at 40  C and then determined with LC-APCI+-MS/MS. The validated method showed acceptable linearity (R2 > 0.99) in the range of 1.25-250 pg/mg for cortisol and cortisone, 2.5-125 pg/mg for heroin, 2.5-1250 pg/mg for ketamine, 2.5-5000 pg/mg for methamphetamine (MAM), 2.5-250 pg/mg for 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), morphine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-AM). Limits of quantification were 1.6, 1.2, 1.6, 1.0, 1.4, 0.3, 2.1, and 1.2 pg/mg for cortisol, cortisone, heroin, ketamine, MAM, MDMA, morphine, and 6-AM, respectively. Method recoveries were from 90-115% for all analytes. Inter-day and intra-day coefficients of variation were within 10%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to detect the aforementioned analytes in hair among female drug addicts who self-reported to be MAM abuser, heroin abuser, ketamine abuser, and abuser of mixture drugs of MAM and heroin. MAM abusers with current MAM use showed significantly higher concentrations of cortisol, MAM, and MDMA than controls with drug withdrawal.
33478072/Arginine Deiminase Induces Immunogenic Cell Death and Is Enhanced by N-acetylcysteine in Murine MC38 Colorectal Cancer Cells and MDA-MB-231 Human Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro The use of arginine deiminase (ADI) for arginine depletion therapy is an attractive anticancer approach. Combination strategies are needed to overcome the resistance of severe types of cancer cells to this monotherapy. In the current study, we report, for the first time, that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has been used in therapeutic practices for several decades, is a potent enhancer for targeted therapy that utilizes arginine deiminase. We demonstrated that pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20) induces apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest in murine MC38 colorectal cancer cells; ADI-PEG 20 induces Ca2+ overload and decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential in MC38 cells. ADI-PEG 20 induced the most important immunogenic cell death (ICD)-associated feature: cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT). The antioxidant NAC enhanced the antitumor activity of ADI-PEG 20 and strengthened its ICD-associated features including the secretion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In addition, these regimens resulted in phagocytosis of treated MC38 cancer cells by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). In conclusion, we describe, for the first time, that NAC in combination with ADI-PEG 20 not only possesses unique cytotoxic anticancer properties but also triggers the hallmarks of immunogenic cell death. Hence, ADI-PEG 20 in combination with NAC may represent a promising approach to treat ADI-sensitive tumors while preventing relapse and metastasis.
33478087/Cellular Redox State Acts as Switch to Determine the Direction of NNT-Catalyzed Reaction in Cystic Fibrosis Cells The redox states of NAD and NADP are linked to each other in the mitochondria thanks to the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) which, by utilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (mDeltaPsi), catalyzes the transfer of redox potential between these two coenzymes, reducing one at the expense of the oxidation of the other. In order to define NNT reaction direction in CF cells, NNT activity under different redox states of cell has been investigated. Using spectrophotometric and western blotting techniques, the presence, abundance and activity level of NNT were determined. In parallel, the levels of NADPH and NADH as well as of mitochondrial and cellular ROS were also quantified. CF cells showed a 70% increase in protein expression compared to the Wt sample; however, regarding NNT activity, it was surprisingly lower in CF cells than healthy cells (about 30%). The cellular redox state, together with the low mDeltaPsi, pushes to drive NNT reverse reaction, at the expense of its antioxidant potential, thus consuming NADPH to support NADH production. At the same time, the reduced NNT activity prevents the NADH, produced by the reaction, from causing an explosion of ROS by the damaged respiratory chain, in accordance with the reduced level of mitochondrial ROS in NNT-loss cells. This new information on cellular bioenergetics represents an important building block for further understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis.
33477998/Impact of SMTP Targeting Plasminogen and Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase on Thrombolysis, Inflammation, and Ischemic Stroke Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol (SMTP) is a large family of small molecules derived from the fungus S. microspora. SMTP acts as a zymogen modulator (specifically, plasminogen modulator) that alters plasminogen conformation to enhance its binding to fibrin and subsequent fibrinolysis. Certain SMTP congeners exert anti-inflammatory effects by targeting soluble epoxide hydrolase. SMTP congeners with both plasminogen modulation activity and anti-inflammatory activity ameliorate various aspects of ischemic stroke in rodents and primates. A remarkable feature of SMTP efficacy is the suppression of hemorrhagic transformation, which is exacerbated by conventional thrombolytic treatments. No drug with such properties has been developed yet, and SMTP would be the first to promote thrombolysis but suppress disease-associated bleeding. On the basis of these findings, one SMTP congener is under clinical study and development. This review summarizes the discovery, mechanism of action, pharmacological activities, and development of SMTP.
33478090/Toward Tailoring the Degradation Rate of Magnesium-Based Biomaterials for Various Medical Applications: Assessing Corrosion, Cytocompatibility and Immunological Effects Magnesium (Mg)-based biomaterials hold considerable promise for applications in regenerative medicine. However, the degradation of Mg needs to be reduced to control toxicity caused by its rapid natural corrosion. In the process of developing new Mg alloys with various surface modifications, an efficient assessment of the relevant properties is essential. In the present study, a WE43 Mg alloy with a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO)-generated surface was investigated. Surface microstructure, hydrogen gas evolution in immersion tests and cytocompatibility were assessed. In addition, a novel in vitro immunological test using primary human lymphocytes was introduced. On PEO-treated WE43, a larger number of pores and microcracks, as well as increased roughness, were observed compared to untreated WE43. Hydrogen gas evolution after two weeks was reduced by 40.7% through PEO treatment, indicating a significantly reduced corrosion rate. In contrast to untreated WE43, PEO-treated WE43 exhibited excellent cytocompatibility. After incubation for three days, untreated WE43 killed over 90% of lymphocytes while more than 80% of the cells were still vital after incubation with the PEO-treated WE43. PEO-treated WE43 slightly stimulated the activation, proliferation and toxin (perforin and granzyme B) expression of CD8+ T cells. This study demonstrates that the combined assessment of corrosion, cytocompatibility and immunological effects on primary human lymphocytes provide a comprehensive and effective procedure for characterizing Mg variants with tailorable degradation and other features. PEO-treated WE43 is a promising candidate for further development as a degradable biomaterial.
33478150/Impact of Selected Signaling Proteins on SNAIL 1 and SNAIL 2 Expression in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines in Relation to Cells' Cisplatin Resistance and EMT Markers Level It has been increasingly recognized that SNAIL1 and SNAIL2, as major EMT-inducers, might also be involved in drug resistance of cancer cells. We sought to determine a relation between SNAIL1/2, E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression, as well as ovarian cancer cells' resistance to cisplatin and EMT markers' level. Thus, four ovarian cancer cell lines, were used: A2780, A2780cis, SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3. We assessed the impact of ERK1/2, AKT and STAT3 proteins (chosen by the profiling activity of over 40 signaling proteins) on SNAIL1/2 expression, along with E-cadherin and N-cadherin levels. We showed that expression of SNAIL1 and N-cadherin are the highest in cisplatin-resistant A2780cis and SK-OV-3 cells, while high SNAIL2 and E-cadherin levels were observed in cisplatin-sensitive A2780 cells. The highest E-cadherin level was noticed in OVCAR-3 cells. SNAIL1/2 expression was dependent on ERK1/2 activity in cisplatin-resistant and potentially invasive SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. STAT-3 regulates expression of SNAIL1/2 and leads to the so-called "cadherin switch" in cancer cells, independently of their chemoresistance. In conclusion, SNAIL1, but not SNAIL2, seems to be involved in ovarian cancer cells' cisplatin resistance. STAT3 is a universal factor determining the expression of SNAIL1/2 in ovarian cancer cells regardless of their chemoresitance or invasive capabilities.
33478028/Strategies for Reducing Salt and Sugar Intakes in Individuals at Increased Cardiometabolic Risk Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the first causes of death worldwide. Reduction in the dietary intake of salt and sugars is important lifestyle advice that is useful for NCD prevention. However, the simple recommendations of reducing salt and sugars by healthcare professionals are often ineffective; innovative strategies are therefore necessary. This review aimed at describing the current knowledge about the strategies to reduce dietary salt and sugar intake, including both strategies for the food industry to reduce the salt or sugar of its products and recommendations for health professionals in a clinical context, such as the replacement with substitutes in foods, the gradual reduction to allow a progressive consumer adaptation towards less intense taste, and the different spatial distribution of tastants within the food matrix with taste intensity enhancement. In addition, the cross-modal interaction between two or more different sensory modalities as an innovative strategy for enhancing sweetness and saltiness perception was described. Finally, the dietary tips for salt and sugar reduction were summarized in order to create a comprehensive guide of dietary advices for healthcare professionals for optimizing the management of patients at increased cardiometabolic risk.
33478055/Terpenoids from Abies holophylla Attenuate LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation in Microglial Cells by Suppressing the JNK-Related Signaling Pathway We have previously reported that phytochemicals from Abies holophylla exhibit anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects by decreasing nitrite production and increasing nerve growth factor production. However, the exact mechanism underscoring these effects has not been revealed. In the present study, we aimed to explore the underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms of A. holophylla and its phytochemicals. We studied various solvent fractions of A. holophylla and found the chloroform and hexane sub-fractions showed the most significant anti-neuroinflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine microglia. Concomitantly, the terpenoids isolated from chloroform and hexane fractions showed similar anti-neuroinflammatory effects with significant inhibition of NO and reactive oxygen species production, and decreased protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase. Interestingly, these terpenoids inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which further inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1beta), with a potency greater than that of the well-known iNOS inhibitor NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). These results suggest that the chloroform- and hexane-soluble fraction mediated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition, in particular the JNK pathway, thereby lowering the inflammatory cascades in LPS-activated murine microglia. Thus, our study suggests that the chloroform and hexane fractions of A. holophylla and their terpenoids may be potential drug candidates for drug discovery against LPS-induced neuroinflammation and neuroinflammatory-related neurodegeneration.
33494776/Synergistic optimisation of expression, folding, and secretion improves E. coli AppA phytase production in Pichia pastoris Background Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is an important platform for heterologous protein production due to its growth to high cell density and outstanding secretory capabilities. Recent developments in synthetic biology have extended the toolbox for genetic engineering of P. pastoris to improve production strains. Yet, overloading the folding and secretion capacity of the cell by over-expression of recombinant proteins is still an issue and rational design of strains is critical to achieve cost-effective industrial manufacture. Several enzymes are commercially produced in P. pastoris, with phytases being one of the biggest on the global market. Phytases are ubiquitously used as a dietary supplement for swine and poultry to increase digestibility of phytic acid, the main form of phosphorous storage in grains. Results Potential bottlenecks for expression of E. coli AppA phytase in P. pastoris were explored by applying bidirectional promoters (BDPs) to express AppA together with folding chaperones, disulfide bond isomerases, trafficking proteins and a cytosolic redox metabolism protein. Additionally, transcriptional studies were used to provide insights into the expression profile of BDPs. A flavoprotein encoded by ERV2 that has not been characterised in P. pastoris was used to improve the expression of the phytase, indicating its role as an alternative pathway to ERO1. Subsequent AppA production increased by 2.90-fold compared to the expression from the state of the AOX1 promoter. Discussion The microbial production of important industrial enzymes in recombinant systems can be improved by applying newly available molecular tools. Overall, the work presented here on the optimisation of phytase production in P. pastoris contributes to the improved understanding of recombinant protein folding and secretion in this important yeast microbial production host.
33499837/Misleading localization by 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type-3: a case report Background Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a heterogeneous autosomal-dominant disorder of calcium hemostasis that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from mild primary hyperparathyroidism. Loss-of-function mutations mainly involving Arg15 residue of the adaptor-related protein complex 2, sigma subunit 1 (AP2S1) cause a rarer, more recently recognized form of FHH, FFH type-3. Recently, 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) showed superior sensitivity to conventional imaging in localizing parathyroid adenomas. We report a new FFH type-3 patient who underwent unnecessary parathyroidectomy in association with misleading FCH-PET/CT imaging. Case presentation A 29-year old woman was initially evaluated for parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent hypercalcemia in 2013. Medical history was positive only for chronic constipation and malaise with no personal or family history of hypercalcemia, kidney stones, or neck surgery. Over seven years, serum calcium level was 2.51-2.89 mmol/L with concomitant PTH level of 58.7-94.8 mmol/L. Serum phosphate levels were in the low/low normal range. Serum creatinine and magnesium levels were normal. 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was 13 nmol/L. 24-hour urine calcium level was 1.92 mmol/day but increased to 6.99 mmol/day after treatment with cholecalciferol 1000 IU daily. Bone mineral density and renal ultrasound were normal. Parathyroid ultrasound showed two hypoechoic nodules inferior to the left and right thyroid lobes; however, 99mtechnitium-sestamibi scans (2013, 2016, 2018) were negative. FCH-PET/CT (2019) showed focal uptake co-localizing with the nodule inferior to the left thyroid lobe. The patient underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy and pathology was consistent with parathyroid hyperplasia. However, postoperatively, serum calcium and PTH levels remained elevated and FCH-PET/CT and ultrasound showed persistence of the uptake/nodule. Whole exome sequencing showed Arg15Cys mutation in the AP2S1 gene characteristic of FHH type-3. Conclusions In this new case of FHH type-3, FCH-PET/CT failed to localize to the hyperplastic parathyroid glands and localized instead to apparently a lymph node. This, together with increased urinary calcium after vitamin D supplementation, led to unnecessary parathyroidectomy. Given the increasingly lower cost of genetic testing and the cost of follow up and unnecessary surgery, it may prudent to include genetic testing for FHH early on in patients with mild PTH-dependent hypercalcemia.
33499877/A positive feedback loop between TAZ and miR-942-3p modulates proliferation, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, glycometabolism and ROS homeostasis in human bladder cancer Background Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) has been reported to be involved in tumor progression, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), glycometabolic modulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup. Herein, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TAZ-induced biological effects in bladder cancer were discovered. Methods qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the levels of TAZ in bladder cancer cells and tissues. CCK-8, colony formation, tube formation, wound healing and Transwell assays and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the biological functions of TAZ, miR-942-3p and growth arrest-specific 1 (GAS1). QRT-PCR and western blotting were used to determine the expression levels of related genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and a dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm the interaction between TAZ and miR-942. In vivo tumorigenesis and colorimetric glycolytic assays were also conducted. Results We confirmed the upregulation and vital roles of TAZ in bladder cancer. TAZ-induced upregulation of miR-942-3p expression amplified upstream signaling by inhibiting the expression of large tumor suppressor 2 (LATS2, a TAZ inhibitor). MiR-942-3p attenuated the impacts on cell proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT, glycolysis and ROS levels induced by TAZ knockdown. Furthermore, miR-942-3p restrained the expression of GAS1 to modulate biological behaviors. Conclusion Our study identified a novel positive feedback loop between TAZ and miR-942-3p that regulates biological functions in bladder cancer cells via GAS1 expression and illustrated that TAZ, miR-942-3p and GAS1 might be potential therapeutic targets for bladder cancer treatment.

33499841/Antibiotic resistance profiles in cultivable microbiota isolated from some romanian natural fishery lakes included in Natura 2000 network Background The present study aims the characterization of antibiotic resistance phenotypes and encoding genes in bacterial strains isolated from some Romanian aquatic fishery lowland salted lakes.  Material/Methods This study was conducted on 44 bacterial strains, mainly belonging to species used as microbiological indicators of fecal pollution isolated from four natural fishery lakes. All strains were tested for their antibiotic susceptibility by disk diffusion method. Simplex and multiplex PCR were performed to identify the beta-lactams antibiotic resistance genes (blaNMD, blaOXA-48, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaCTX-M, blaTEM), sulfonamides (Sul1, Sul2), tetracyclines (TetA, TetB, TetC, TetD, TetM), aminoglycosides (aac3Ia), vancomycin (VanA, VanB, VanC), macrolides (ermA, ermB, ermC) as well as the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) markers (QnrA, QnrB, QnrS), and class 1 integrons (Int1, drfA1-aadA1). Results The Enterococcus spp. isolates exhibited phenotypic resistance to vancomycin (35 %) and macrolides (erythromycin) (75 %); from the vancomycin - resistant strains, 5 % harboured VanA (E. faecalis), while the erythromycin resistant isolates were positive for the ermA gene (E. faecalis - 10 %, E. faecium - 5 %). The Gram- negative rods (GNR) exhibited a high level of resistance to beta-lactams: cefuroxime (63 %), cefazolin (42 %), ceftriaxone (8 %), ceftazidime and aztreonam (4 % each). The genetic determinants for beta-lactam resistance were represented by blaCTX-M-like (33 %), blaNDM-like and blaIMP-like (8.33 %) genes. The resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics was ascertained to the following genes: quinolones (QnrS - 4.16 %); sulfonamides (Sul1-75 %, Sul2-4.16 %); aminoglycosides (aac3Ia - 4.16 %); tetracyclines (tetA - 25 %, tetC - 15 %). The integrase gene was found in more than 50 % of the studied strains (58.33 %). Conclusions The cultivable aquatic microbiota from fishery lakes is dominated by enterococci and Enterobacterales strains. The GNR strains exhibited high levels of beta-lactam resistance mediated by extended spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. The Enterococcus sp. isolates were highly resistant to macrolides and vancomycin. The high level and diversity of resistance markers, correlated with a high frequency of integrons is suggesting that this environment could act as an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes with a great probability to be horizontally transmitted to other associated species from the aquatic sediments microbiota, raising the potential zoonotic risk for fish consumers.
33532038/Emodin Induced Necroptosis and Inhibited Glycolysis in the Renal Cancer Cells by Enhancing ROS Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a tumor with unpredictable presentation and poor clinical outcome. RCC is always resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and weakly sensitive to immunotherapeutic agents. Therefore, novel agents and approaches are urgently needed for the treatment of RCC. Emodin, an anthraquinone compound extracted from rhubarb and other traditional Chinese herbs, has been implicated in a wide variety of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor activities. However, its role in RCC remains unknown. In this study, we found that emodin effectively killed renal cancer cells without significant toxicity to noncancerous cell HK-2. Flow cytometry assay with Annexin V-FITC and PI demonstrated that emodin induces necroptosis, but not apoptosis, in renal cancer cells. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation levels of RIP1 and MLKL, the key necroptosis-related proteins, were significantly increased. To explore how emodin inhibits kidney tumor growth, we tested reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and found that the levels of ROS increased upon emodin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that emodin induces necroptosis through ROS-mediated activation of JNK signaling pathway and also inhibits glycolysis by downregulation of GLUT1 through ROS-mediated inactivation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings revealed the potential mechanisms by which emodin suppresses renal cancer cell growth and will help develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with JNK- or PI3K/AKT-dysregulated renal cancer.
33477693/Expanding the Scope of the Cleavable N-(Methoxy)oxazolidine Linker for the Synthesis of Oligonucleotide Conjugates Oligonucleotides modified by a 2'-deoxy-2'-(N-methoxyamino) ribonucleotide react readily with aldehydes in slightly acidic conditions to yield the corresponding N-(methoxy)oxazolidine-linked oligonucleotide-conjugates. The reaction is reversible and dynamic in slightly acidic conditions, while the products are virtually stable above pH 7, where the reaction is in a ''switched off-state''. Small molecular examinations have demonstrated that aldehyde constituents affect the cleavage rate of the N-(methoxy)oxazolidine-linkage. This can be utilized to adjust the stability of this pH-responsive cleavable linker for drug delivery applications. In the present study, Fmoc-beta-Ala-H was immobilized to a serine-modified ChemMatrix resin and used for the automated assembly of two peptidealdehydes and one aldehyde-modified peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In addition, a triantennary N-acetyl-d-galactosamine-cluster with a beta-Ala-H unit has been synthesized. These aldehydes were conjugated via N-(methoxy)oxazolidine-linkage to therapeutically relevant oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and one DNA-aptamer in 19-47% isolated yields. The cleavage rates of the conjugates were studied in slightly acidic conditions. In addition to the diverse set of conjugates synthesized, these experiments and a comparison to published data demonstrate that the simple conversion of Gly-H to beta-Ala-H residue resulted in a faster cleavage of the N-(methoxy)oxazolidine-linker at pH 5, being comparable (T0.5 ca 7 h) to hydrazone-based structures.
33542783/Ascorbic Acid: A New Player of Epigenetic Regulation in LPS-gingivalis Treated Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells Periodontitis is usually sustained from microorganism of oral cavity, like Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Periodontal disease is an infectious disease that afflicts a large number of people. Researches are investigating on the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) response to inflammatory events in combination with antioxidant substances. In particular, ascorbic acid (AA) increased cell proliferation, upregulated the cells pluripotency marker expression, provide a protection from inflammation, and induced the regeneration of periodontal ligament tissue. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the effects of AA in primary culture of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) exposed to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS-G). The effect of AA on hPDLSCs exposed to LPS-G was determined through the cell proliferation assay. The molecules involved in the inflammatory pathway and epigenetic regulation have been identified using immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. miR-210 level was quantified by qRT-PCR, and the ROS generation was finally studied. Cells co-treated with LPS-G and AA showed a restoration in terms of cell proliferation. The expression of NFkappaB, MyD88, and p300 was upregulated in LPS-G exposed cells, while the expression was attenuated in the co-treatment with AA. DNMT1 expression is attenuated in the cells exposed to the inflammatory stimulus. The level of miR-210 was reduced in stimulated cells, while the expression was evident in the hPDLSCs co-treated with LPS-G and AA. In conclusion, the AA could enhance a protective effect in in vitro periodontitis model, downregulating the inflammatory pathway and ROS generation and modulating the miR-210 level.
33542786/1-O-Hexyl-2,3,5-Trimethylhydroquinone Ameliorates the Development of Preeclampsia through Suppression of Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Cell Apoptosis 1-O-Hexyl-2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone (HTHQ), a potent nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activator, has potent antioxidant activity by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the role of HTHQ on the development of preeclampsia (PE) and the underlying mechanisms have barely been explored. In the present study, PE model was induced by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) in pregnant mice. The results showed that HTHQ treatment significantly relieved the high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and proteinuria and increased the fetal weight and fetal weight/placenta weight in preeclamptic mice. Furthermore, we found that HTHQ treatment significantly decreased soluble endoglin (sEng), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and activin A and restored vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in preeclamptic mice. In addition, HTHQ treatment inhibited oxidative stress and endothelial cell apoptosis by increasing the levels of Nrf2 and its downstream haemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein. In line with the data in vivo, we discovered that HTHQ treatment attenuated oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following hypoxia and reperfusion (H/R), and the HTHQ-mediated protection was lost after transfected with siNrf2. In conclusion, these results suggested that HTHQ ameliorates the development of preeclampsia through suppression of oxidative stress and endothelial cell apoptosis.
33542782/Protective Effects of Oroxylin A against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity via the Activation of Sirt1 in Mice Doxorubicin- (DOX-) related cardiac injury impairs the life quality of patients with cancer. This largely limited the clinical use of DOX. It is of great significance to find a novel strategy to reduce DOX-related cardiac injury. Oroxylin A (OA) has been identified to exert beneficial effects against inflammatory diseases and cancers. Here, we investigated whether OA could attenuate DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity in mice. A single dose of DOX was used to induce acute cardiac injury in mice. To explore the protective effects, OA was administered to mice for ten days beginning from five days before DOX injection. The data in our study indicated that OA inhibited DOX-induced heart weight loss, reduction in cardiac function, and the elevation in myocardial injury markers. DOX injection resulted in increased oxidative damage, inflammation accumulation, and myocardial apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, and these pathological alterations were alleviated by treatment of OA. OA activated the sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) signaling pathway via the cAMP/protein kinase A, and its protective effects were blocked by Sirt1 deficiency. OA treatment did not affect the tumor-killing action of DOX in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, OA protected against DOX-related acute cardiac injury via the regulation of Sirt1.
33509174/Metabolomic profiles of plasma and uterine luminal fluids from healthy and repeat breeder Holstein cows Background Repeat breeding is a critical reproductive disorder in cattle. The problem of repeat breeder cattle remains largely unmanageable due to a lack of informative biomarkers. Here, we utilized metabolomic profiling in an attempt to identify metabolites in the blood plasma and uterine luminal fluids. We collected blood and uterine fluid from repeat breeder and healthy cows on day 7 of the estrous cycle. Results Metabolomic analysis identified 17 plasma metabolites detected at concentrations that distinguished between the two groups, including decreased various bile acids among the repeat breeders. However, no metabolites that varied significantly were detected in the uterine luminal fluids between two groups. Among the plasma samples, kynurenine was identified as undergoing the most significant variation. Kynurenine is a metabolite produced from tryptophan via the actions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As IDO is key for maternal immune tolerance and induced in response to interferon tau (IFNT, ruminant maternal recognition of pregnancy factor), we examined the responsiveness to IFNT on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy and repeat breeder cows. The mRNA expression of IFNT-response makers (ISG15 and MX2) were significantly increased by IFNT treatment in a dose-dependent manner in both groups. Although treatment with IFNT promoted the expression of IDO in PBMCs from both groups, it did so at a substantially reduced rate among the repeat breeder cows, suggesting that decreased levels of kynurenine may relate to the reduced IDO expression in repeat breeder cows. Conclusions These findings provide valuable information towards the identification of critical biomarkers for repeat breeding syndrome in cattle.

33509166/Predicting in vivo absorption of chloramphenicol in frogs using in vitro percutaneous absorption data Background Infectious disease, particularly the fungal disease chytridiomycosis (caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), is a primary cause of amphibian declines and extinctions worldwide. The transdermal route, although offering a simple option for drug administration in frogs, is complicated by the lack of knowledge regarding percutaneous absorption kinetics. This study builds on our previous studies in frogs, to formulate and predict the percutaneous absorption of a drug for the treatment of infectious disease in frogs. Chloramphenicol, a drug with reported efficacy in the treatment of infectious disease including Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, was formulated with 20% v/v propylene glycol and applied to the ventral pelvis of Rhinella marina for up to 6 h. Serum samples were taken during and up to 18 h following exposure, quantified for chloramphenicol content, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. Results Serum levels of chloramphenicol reached the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; 12.5 mug.mL- 1) for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis within 90-120 min of exposure commencing, and remained above the MIC for the remaining exposure time. Cmax (17.09 +- 2.81 mug.mL- 1) was reached at 2 h, while elimination was long (t1/2 = 18.68 h). Conclusions The model, based on in vitro data and adjusted for formulation components and in vivo data, was effective in predicting chloramphenicol flux to ensure the MIC for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was reached, with serum levels being well above the MICs for other common bacterial pathogens in frogs. Chloramphenicol's extended elimination means that a 6-h bath may be adequate to maintain serum levels for up to 24 h. We suggest trialling a reduction of the currently-recommended continuous (23 h/day for 21-35 days) chloramphenicol bathing for chytrid infection with this formulation.

33508013/A comparison of the metabolic side-effects of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs risperidone and paliperidone in animal models Background The second generation antipsychotic drugs represent the most common form of pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia disorders. It is now well established that most of the second generation drugs cause metabolic side-effects. Risperidone and its active metabolite paliperidone (9-hydroxyrisperidone) are two commonly used antipsychotic drugs with moderate metabolic liability. However, there is a dearth of preclinical data that directly compares the metabolic effects of these two drugs, using sophisticated experimental procedures. The goal of the present study was to compare metabolic effects for each drug versus control animals. Methods Adult female rats were acutely treated with either risperidone (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 6 mg/kg), paliperidone (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 6 mg/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the glucose tolerance test; plasma was collected to measure insulin levels to measure insulin resistance with HOMA-IR. Separate groups of rats were treated with either risperidone (1, 6 mg/kg), paliperidone (1, 6 mg/kg) or vehicle, and subjected to the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Results Fasting glucose levels were increased by all but the lowest dose of risperidone, but only with the highest dose of paliperidone. HOMA-IR increased for both drugs with all but the lowest dose, while the three highest doses decreased glucose tolerance for both drugs. Risperidone and paliperidone both exhibited dose-dependent decreases in the glucose infusion rate in the clamp, reflecting pronounced insulin resistance. Conclusions In preclinical models, both risperidone and paliperidone exhibited notable metabolic side-effects that were dose-dependent. Differences between the two were modest, and most notable as effects on fasting glucose.
33507978/Which indoor residual spraying insecticide best complements standard pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets for improved control of pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors? Background Where resources are available, non-pyrethroid IRS can be deployed to complement standard pyrethroid LLINs with the aim of achieving improved vector control and managing insecticide resistance. The impact of the combination may however depend on the type of IRS insecticide deployed. Studies comparing combinations of pyrethroid LLINs with different types of non-pyrethroid IRS products will be necessary for decision making. Methods The efficacy of combining a standard pyrethroid LLIN (DuraNet ) with IRS insecticides from three chemical classes (bendiocarb, chlorfenapyr and pirimiphos-methyl CS) was evaluated in an experimental hut trial against wild pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.l. in Cove, Benin. The combinations were also compared to each intervention alone. WHO cylinder and CDC bottle bioassays were performed to assess susceptibility of the local An. gambiae s.l. vector population at the Cove hut site to insecticides used in the combinations. Results Susceptibility bioassays revealed that the vector population at Cove, was resistant to pyrethroids (<20% mortality) but susceptible to carbamates, chlorfenapyr and organophosphates (>=98% mortality). Mortality of wild free-flying pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae s.l. entering the hut with the untreated net control (4%) did not differ significantly from DuraNet  alone (8%, p = 0.169). Pirimiphos-methyl CS IRS induced the highest mortality both on its own (85%) and in combination with DuraNet  (81%). Mortality with the DuraNet  + chlorfenapyr IRS combination was significantly higher than each intervention alone (46% vs. 33% and 8%, p<0.05) demonstrating an additive effect. The DuraNet  + bendiocarb IRS combination induced significantly lower mortality compared to the other combinations (32%, p<0.05). Blood-feeding inhibition was very low with the IRS treatments alone (3-5%) but increased significantly when they were combined with DuraNet  (61% - 71%, p<0.05). Blood-feeding rates in the combinations were similar to the net alone. Adding bendiocarb IRS to DuraNet  induced significantly lower levels of mosquito feeding compared to adding chlorfenapyr IRS (28% vs. 37%, p = 0.015). Conclusions Adding non-pyrethroid IRS to standard pyrethroid-only LLINs against a pyrethroid-resistant vector population which is susceptible to the IRS insecticide, can provide higher levels of vector mosquito control compared to the pyrethroid net alone or IRS alone. Adding pirimiphos-methyl CS IRS may provide substantial improvements in vector control while adding chlorfenapyr IRS can demonstrate an additive effect relative to both interventions alone. Adding bendiocarb IRS may show limited enhancements in vector control owing to its short residual effect.
33507942/Polymer-assisted intratumoral delivery of ethanol: Preclinical investigation of safety and efficacy in a murine breast cancer model Focal tumor ablation with ethanol could provide benefits in low-resource settings because of its low overall cost, minimal imaging technology requirements, and acceptable clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, ethanol ablation is not commonly utilized because of a lack of predictability of the ablation zone, caused by inefficient retention of ethanol at the injection site. To create a predictable zone of ablation, we have developed a polymer-assisted ablation method using ethyl cellulose (EC) mixed with ethanol. EC is ethanol-soluble and water-insoluble, allowing for EC-ethanol to be injected as a liquid and precipitate into a solid, occluding the leakage of ethanol upon contact with tissue. The aims of this study were to compare the 1) safety, 2) release kinetics, 3) spatial distribution, 4) necrotic volume, and 5) overall survival of EC-ethanol to conventional ethanol ablation in a murine breast tumor model. Non-target tissue damage was monitored through localized adverse events recording, ethanol release kinetics with Raman spectroscopy, injectate distribution with in vivo imaging, target-tissue necrosis with NADH-diaphorase staining, and overall survival by proxy of tumor growth. EC-ethanol exhibited decreased localized adverse events, a slowing of the release rate of ethanol, more compact injection zones, 5-fold increase in target-tissue necrosis, and longer overall survival rates compared to the same volume of pure ethanol. A single 150 muL dose of 6% EC-ethanol achieved a similar survival probability rates to six daily 50 muL doses of pure ethanol used to simulate a slow-release of ethanol over 6 days. Taken together, these results demonstrate that EC-ethanol is safer and more effective than ethanol alone for ablating tumors.
33509221/Purification and identification of a surfactin biosurfactant and engine oil degradation by Bacillus velezensis KLP2016 Engine oil used in automobiles is a threat to soil and water due to the recalcitrant properties of its hydrocarbons. It pollutes surrounding environment which affects both flora and fauna. Microbes can degrade hydrocarbons containing engine oil and utilize it as a substrate for their growth. Our results demonstrated that cell-free broth of Bacillus velezensis KLP2016 (Gram + ve, endospore forming; Accession number KY214239) recorded an emulsification index (E24%) from 52.3% to 65.7% against different organic solvents, such as benzene, pentane, cyclohexane, xylene, n-hexane, toluene and engine oil. The surface tension of the cell-free broth of B. velezensis grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 35  C decreased from 55 to 40 mN m-1at critical micelle concentration 17.2 microg/mL. The active biosurfactant molecule of cell-free broth of Bacillus velezensis KLP2016 was purified by Dietheylaminoethyl-cellulose and size exclusion chromatography, followed by HPLC (RT = 1.130), UV-vis spectrophotometry (210 nm) and thin layer chromatography (Rf = 0.90). The molecular weight of purified biosurfactant was found to be ~ 1.0 kDa, based on Electron Spray Ionization-MS. A concentration of 1980 x 10-2 parts per million of CO2 was trapped in a KOH solution after 15 days of incubation in Luria-Bertani broth containing 1% engine oil. Our results suggest that bacterium Bacillus velezensis KLP2016 may promise a new dimension to solving the engine oil pollution problem in near future.
33514384/The effects of canola and olive oils consumption compared to sunflower oil, on lipid profile and hepatic steatosis in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome: a randomized controlled trial Background Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinopathies and metabolic disorders in women during their reproductive years. It is often associated with dyslipidemia and other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study was aimed to evaluate dietary intervention effects with canola and olive oils compared to sunflower oil on lipid profile and fatty liver severity among women with PCOS. Method This study was a 10-week intervention including 72 women with PCOS. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups for receiving 25 g/day canola, olive, or sunflower oils for 10 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes were to assess changes in lipid profile and in fatty liver severity, respectively. Result At the end of the study, 72 patients with a mean age of 29.31 were analysed. Canola oil consumption resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of TG (P = 0.002) and TC/HDL (P = 0.021), LDL/HDL (P = 0.047), and TG/HDL (P = 0.001) ratios, however, there was no significant reduction in lipid profile following olive oil consumption. Canola (P < 0.001) and olive oils (P = 0.005) could significantly reduce the fatty liver grade. Moreover, HOMA-IR in both canola (P < 0.001) and olive (P = 0.004) groups was significantly decreased. Conclusion In total, compared to olive and sunflower oils, significant improvements in lipid profile, liver function, and HOMA-IR were observed following canola oil consumption in women with PCOS.

33468700/5-Aminosalicylic Acid Ameliorates Colitis and Checks Dysbiotic Escherichia coli Expansion by Activating PPAR-gamma Signaling in the Intestinal Epithelium An expansion of Enterobacterales in the fecal microbiota is a microbial signature of dysbiosis that is linked to many noncommunicable diseases, including ulcerative colitis. Here, we used Escherichia coli, a representative of the Enterobacterales, to show that its dysbiotic expansion during colitis can be remediated by modulating host epithelial metabolism. ABSTRACT 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, is a widely used first-line medication for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, but its anti-inflammatory mechanism is not fully resolved. Here, we show that 5-ASA ameliorates colitis in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice by activating PPAR-gamma signaling in the intestinal epithelium. DSS-induced colitis was associated with a loss of epithelial hypoxia and a respiration-dependent luminal expansion of Escherichia coli, which could be ameliorated by treatment with 5-ASA. However, 5-ASA was no longer able to reduce inflammation, restore epithelial hypoxia, or blunt an expansion of E. coli in DSS-treated mice that lacked Pparg expression specifically in the intestinal epithelium. These data suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of 5-ASA requires activation of epithelial PPAR-gamma signaling, thus pointing to the intestinal epithelium as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in ulcerative colitis.
33468692/Trehalose Recycling Promotes Energy-Efficient Biosynthesis of the Mycobacterial Cell Envelope The mycomembrane layer of the mycobacterial cell envelope is a barrier to environmental, immune, and antibiotic insults. There is considerable evidence of mycomembrane plasticity during infection and in response to host-mimicking stresses. ABSTRACT The mycomembrane layer of the mycobacterial cell envelope is a barrier to environmental, immune, and antibiotic insults. There is considerable evidence of mycomembrane plasticity during infection and in response to host-mimicking stresses. Since mycobacteria are resource and energy limited under these conditions, it is likely that remodeling has distinct requirements from those of the well-characterized biosynthetic program that operates during unrestricted growth. Unexpectedly, we found that mycomembrane remodeling in nutrient-starved, nonreplicating mycobacteria includes synthesis in addition to turnover. Mycomembrane synthesis under these conditions occurs along the cell periphery, in contrast to the polar assembly of actively growing cells, and both liberates and relies on the nonmammalian disaccharide trehalose. In the absence of trehalose recycling, de novo trehalose synthesis fuels mycomembrane remodeling. However, mycobacteria experience ATP depletion, enhanced respiration, and redox stress, hallmarks of futile cycling and the collateral dysfunction elicited by some bactericidal antibiotics. Inefficient energy metabolism compromises the survival of trehalose recycling mutants in macrophages. Our data suggest that trehalose recycling alleviates the energetic burden of mycomembrane remodeling under stress. Cell envelope recycling pathways are emerging targets for sensitizing resource-limited bacterial pathogens to host and antibiotic pressure.
33468684/Sterilization by Adaptive Immunity of a Conditionally Persistent Mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis The bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis can enter into a persistent state in which M. tuberculosis can evade host immunity, thereby reducing the effectiveness of current tuberculosis vaccines. Understanding the factors that contribute to persistence would enable the rational design of vaccines effective against persisters. ABSTRACT Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, can enter into a persistent state that confers resistance to antibacterial agents. Many observations suggest that persistent M. tuberculosis cells also evade the antimycobacterial immune mechanisms, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the current tuberculosis vaccine. Understanding the factors that contribute to persistence may enable the rational design of vaccines that stimulate effective immune killing mechanisms against persister cells. Independent mutations targeting the methionine and arginine biosynthetic pathways are bactericidal for M. tuberculosis in mice. However, in this study, we discovered that the addition of leucine and pantothenate auxotrophy altered the bactericidality of methionine auxotrophy. Whereas the leucine/pantothenate/methionine auxotrophic M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv DeltaleuCD DeltapanCD DeltametA was eliminated in immunocompetent mice, this strain persisted in multiple organs of immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice for at least a year. In contrast, the leucine/pantothenate/arginine auxotroph H37Rv DeltaleuCD DeltapanCD DeltaargB was eliminated in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice. Our results showed that leucine and pantothenate starvation metabolically blocked the sterilization mechanisms of methionine starvation but not those of arginine starvation. These triple-auxotrophic strains should be invaluable tools for unravelling the bacterial and host factors that enable persistence and for vaccine development studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines that boost immune recognition of M. tuberculosis in the persistent state. The sterilization of the DeltaleuCD DeltapanCD DeltametA auxotroph in immunocompetent mice, but not in mice lacking an adaptive immune response, could provide a new system for studying the antimycobacterial killing mechanisms of adaptive immunity.
33468701/The Canonical Long-Chain Fatty Acid Sensing Machinery Processes Arachidonic Acid To Inhibit Virulence in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play important roles in host immunity. Manipulation of lipid content in host tissues through diet or pharmacological interventions is associated with altered severity of various inflammatory diseases. ABSTRACT The mammalian gastrointestinal tract is a complex biochemical organ that generates a diverse milieu of host- and microbe-derived metabolites. In this environment, bacterial pathogens sense and respond to specific stimuli, which are integrated into the regulation of their virulence programs. Previously, we identified the transcription factor FadR, a long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) sensor, as a novel virulence regulator in the human foodborne pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Here, we demonstrate that exogenous LCFAs directly inhibit the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island in EHEC through sensing by FadR. Moreover, in addition to LCFAs that are 18 carbons in length or shorter, we introduce host-derived arachidonic acid (C20:4) as an additional LCFA that is recognized by the FadR system in EHEC. We show that arachidonic acid is processed by the acyl-CoA synthetase FadD, which permits binding to FadR and decreases FadR affinity for its target DNA sequences. This interaction enables the transcriptional regulation of FadR-responsive operons by arachidonic acid in EHEC, including the LEE. Finally, we show that arachidonic acid inhibits hallmarks of EHEC disease in a FadR-dependent manner, including EHEC attachment to epithelial cells and the formation of attaching and effacing lesions. Together, our findings delineate a molecular mechanism demonstrating how LCFAs can directly inhibit the virulence of an enteric bacterial pathogen. More broadly, our findings expand the repertoire of ligands sensed by the canonical LFCA sensing machinery in EHEC to include arachidonic acid, an important bioactive lipid that is ubiquitous within host environments.
33513207/Exploration of metabolite profiles in the biofluids of dairy cows by proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Studies that screen for metabolites produced in ruminants are actively underway. We aimed to evaluate the metabolic profiles of five biofluids (ruminal fluid, serum, milk, urine, and feces) in dairy cow by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and provide a list of metabolites in each biofluid for the benefit of future research. We analyzed the metabolites in five biofluids from lactating cows using proton nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; 96, 73, 88, 118, and 128 metabolites were identified in the five biofluids, respectively. In addition, 8, 6, 9, and 17 metabolites were unique to ruminal fluid, serum, milk, and urine, respectively. The metabolites present at high concentrations were: acetate, propionate, and butyrate in ruminal fluid; lactate, glucose, and acetate in serum; and lactose, guanidoacetate, and glucitol in milk. In addition, the following metabolites were present at high concentrations: hippurate, urea, and trimethylamine N-oxide in urine and acetate, propionate, and butyrate in feces. The score plots of the principal component analysis did not show clear distinctions among the five biofluid samples. The purpose of this study was to verify the ability of our metabolomics approaches to identify metabolites in the biofluids of dairy cows.
33551679/The Protective Effect of Anthocyanins Extracted from Aronia Melanocarpa Berry in Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Mice Background  Our previous research showed the antioxidant activity of anthocyanins extracted from Aronia melanocarpa of black chokeberry in vitro. Ischemia acute kidney injury is a significant risk in developing progressive and deterioration of renal function leading to clinic chronic kidney disease. There were many attempts to protect the kidney against this progression of renal damage. Current study was designed to examine the effect of pretreatment with three anthocyanins named cyanidin-3-arabinoside, cyanidin-3-glucodise, and cyaniding-3-galactoside against acute ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse kidney.  Methods  Acute renal injury model was initiated by 30 min clamping bilateral renal pedicle and followed by 24-hour reperfusion in C57Bl/6J mice. Four groups of mice were orally pretreated in 50 mg/g/12 h for two weeks with cyanidin-3-arabinoside, cyanidin-3-glucodise, and cyaniding-3-galactoside and anthocyanins (three-cyanidin mixture), respectively, sham-control group and the renal injury-untreated groups only with saline.  Results  The model resulted in renal dysfunction with high serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and changes in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and MCP-1), renal oxidative stress (SOD, GSH, and CAT), lipid peroxidation (TBARS and MDA), and apoptosis (caspase-9). Pretreatment of two weeks resulted in different extent amelioration of renal dysfunction and tubular damage and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis, thus suggesting that cyanidins are potentially effective in acute renal ischemia by the decrease of inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation, as well as apoptosis.  Conclusion  the current study provided the first attempt to investigate the role of anthocyanins purified from Aronia melanocarpa berry in amelioration of acute renal failure via antioxidant and cytoprotective effects.
33516262/The effect of fingolimod on regulatory T cells in a mouse model of brain ischaemia Background The role of the immune system in stroke is well-recognised. Fingolimod, an immunomodulatory agent licensed for the management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, has been shown to provide benefit in rodent models of stroke. Its mechanism of action, however, remains unclear. We hypothesised fingolimod increases the number and/or function of regulatory T cells (Treg), a lymphocyte population which promotes stroke recovery. The primary aim of this study was to rigorously investigate the effect of fingolimod on Tregs in a mouse model of brain ischaemia. The effect of fingolimod in mice with common stroke-related comorbidities (ageing and hypercholesteremia) was also investigated. Methods Young (15-17 weeks), aged C57BL/6 mice (72-73 weeks), and ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (20-21 weeks) underwent permanent electrocoagulation of the left middle cerebral artery. Mice received either saline or fingolimod (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) at 2, 24, and 48 h post-ischaemia via intraperitoneal injection. Another cohort of young mice (8-9, 17-19 weeks) received short-term (5 days) or long-term (10 days) fingolimod (0.5 mg/kg) treatment. Flow cytometry was used to quantify Tregs in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify FoxP3+ cell infiltration into the ischaemic brain. Results Fingolimod significantly increased the frequency of Tregs within the CD4+ T cell population in blood and spleen post-ischaemia in all three mouse cohorts compared to untreated ischemic mice. The highest splenic Treg frequency in fingolimod-treated mice was observed in ApoE-/- mice (9.32 +- 1.73% vs. 7.8 +- 3.01% in young, 6.09 +- 1.64% in aged mice). The highest circulating Treg frequency was also noted in ApoE-/- mice (8.39 +- 3.26% vs. 5.43 +- 2.74% in young, 4.56 +- 1.60% in aged mice). Fingolimod significantly increased the number of FoxP3+ cells in the infarct core of all mice. The most pronounced effects were seen when mice were treated for 10 days post-ischaemia. Conclusions Fingolimod increases Treg frequency in spleen and blood post-ischaemia and enhances the number of FoxP3+ cells in the ischaemic brain. The effect of fingolimod on this regulatory cell population may underlie its neuroprotective activity and could be exploited as part of future stroke therapy.

33501873/A novel nasal co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nanoemulsion with improved downregulation of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and IL-1 in rabbit models of ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis Abstract Purpose The work aimed to develop a co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nasal nanoemulsion for allergic rhinitis management. Methods Compatibility studies were conducted adopting differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Nanoemulsion formulations were prepared using soybean lecithin, olive oil and tween 80. Sodium cholate and glycerol were employed as co-surfactants. Nanoemulsions were assessed for viscosity, pH, droplet size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, electrical conductivity, entrapment, In vitro drug release and corresponding kinetics. Stability of the selected formulation was investigated. The biological effectiveness was evaluated in rabbit models of ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis by measuring TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and IL-1. Results Compatibility studies revealed absence of drug/drug interactions. Nanoemulsions exhibited > 90% entrapment efficiency. The selected nanoemulsion demonstrated small droplet size (85.2 +- 0.2 nm), low PDI (0.35 +- 0.0) and appropriate Zeta Potential (-23.3 +- 0.2) and stability. It also displayed enhanced in vitro drug release following the Higuashi Diffusion and Baker-Lonsdale models. The mean relative mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and TGF-beta significantly decreased from 9.59 +- 1.06, 4.15 +- 0.02 and 4.15 +- 0.02 to 1.28 +- 0.02, 1.93 +- 0.06 and 1.56 +- 0.02 respectively after treatment with the selected nanoemulsion formulation. Conclusion The results reflected a promising potent effect of the combined loratadine and sulpiride nasal nanoemulsion in managing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
33501870/Bioadhesive polymer/lipid hybrid nanoparticles as oral delivery system of raloxifene with enhancive intestinal retention and bioavailability Abstract Raloxifene (RLX) is a second-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. RLX fails to be developed into injectable dosage forms due to poor solubility. Although oral formulations are clinically available, the lower bioavailability (<2%) embarrasses the pharmaceutists. This work reported a bioadhesive nanosystem intended for oral delivery of RLX to enhance its oral bioavailability and address the formulation challenge. The bioadhesive nanosystem refers to polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles made up of Carbopol 940, glyceryl distearate, and TGPS. RLX was solidly encapsulated into bioadhesive nanoparticles (bNPs) through a nanoprecipitation technique along with synchronous desalting of RLX HCl. The resultant RLX-loaded bNPs (RLX-bNPs) were characterized by particle size, zeta potential, morphology, and entrapment efficiency. The in vitro release and in vivo oral bioavailability of RLX-bNPs in rats were comparatively investigated with RLX-loaded common lipid nanoparticles (RLX-cNPs). The preferred formulation possesses a particle size of 150 nm around with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.282. RLX-bNPs exhibited slower drug release than RLX-cNPs owing to the presence of an adhesive layer. After oral administration, RLX-bNPs resulted in significant enhancement in the bioavailability of RLX, up to 556.9% relative to RLX suspensions, while it was merely 244.7% for RLX-cNPs. Cellular testing and ex vivo transport imaging demonstrated that bNPs were endowed with excellent intestinal epithelial affinity and absorbability. Our study affords an alternative option for designing a suitable oral delivery system specific to amphiphobic drugs like RLX HCl.
33501867/Local anesthetic lidocaine-encapsulated polymyxin-chitosan nanoparticles delivery for wound healing: in vitro and in vivo tissue regeneration Abstract In relieving local pains, lidocaine, one of ester-type local anesthetics, has been used. To develop the lidocaine membranes of enhanced local anesthetic effects, we have designed to establish the composition of wound dressings based on lidocaine chloride (LCH) (anesthetic drug)-loaded chitosan (CS)/polymyxin B sulfate (PMB). The LCH membranes (LCH-CS/PMB) was fabricated by the LCH oxide solutions within the CS/PMB matrix. The influences of different experimental limitations on CS/PMB membrane formations were examined. The double membrane particle sizes were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Additionally, antibacterial efficacy was developed for gram-positive and negative microorganisms. Moreover, we examined in vivo healing of skin wounds formed in mouse models over 16 days. In contrast to the untreated wounds, rapid healing was perceived in the LCH-CS/PMB-treated wound with less damaging. These findings indicate that LCH-CS/PMB-based bandaging materials could be a potential innovative biomaterial for tissue repair and regeneration for wound healing applications in an animal model.
33524047/One-spot synthesis of FeOOH/rGO composites by ferrous-ion-induced self-assembly of graphene oxides with different degrees of oxidation In this study, graphene oxide sheets with different oxidation degrees were reduced by ferrous ion for coating FeOOH nano particles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix to synthesize FeOOH/rGO composites. The effect of the degree of oxidation on the morphology and chemical structure of FeOOH/rGO was studied using scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis. The particle size of FeOOH crystallites was approximately 100 nm, and they were distributed uniformly on the surface and in the pores of FeOOH/rGO. FeOOH/rGO prepared with mildly oxidized graphite had fewer defects, higher specific surface area, and higher FeOOH content than FeOOH/rGO prepared with highly oxidized graphite. These features resulted in better electrochemical properties, such as larger specific capacitance and lower charge transfer resistance.
33564682/Real-World Experience of Safety of Mycophenolate Mofetil in 119 Japanese Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Retrospective Single-Center Study Objectives  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the standard treatment for lupus nephritis. In Japan, it was approved for lupus nephritis in 2015. We investigated its real-world safety and effectiveness in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Methods  We analyzed the continuation rate, adverse events, and reasons for discontinuation of MMF in Japanese patients with SLE in a retrospective single-center study. We included 119 patients who received MMF from 31 July 2015 to 31 May 2019. To compare demographic and clinical characteristics between groups, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for nonnormally distributed variables. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for the discontinuation rate of MMF.  Results  Patients consisted of 18 males and 101 females. Thirty-five patients discontinued MMF. The cumulative discontinuation rate was 42.4%. Twenty-nine patients discontinued MMF due to adverse events, and six patients discontinued MMF due to remission of SLE or desire for childbearing. At the time of the last observation, the lupus low disease activity state achievement rate was significantly lower in patients who experienced adverse events than those who did not (64% vs. 35%, P = 0.009). We examined the concentration of mycophenolate acid (trough level) in stored frozen serum in 11 patients. Two patients had irreversible complications due to viral meningitis; their trough mycophenolate acid concentrations were 8.3 and 6.3 mug/mL, respectively.  Conclusions  Although MMF may be effective in Japanese patients with SLE, physicians should pay attention to infections in patients with high mycophenolate acid concentrations.
33564684/Impact of Anesthetic Agents on Endothelial Glycocalyx Injury during Total Knee Arthroplasty: Desflurane- vs. Propofol-Based Anesthesia:A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Background  Ischemia-reperfusion injury and inflammation after tourniquet deflation in total knee arthroplasty are known to be associated with endothelial glycocalyx (EG) injury. This study is aimed at comparing EG injury between desflurane- and propofol-based anesthesia in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.  Materials and Methods  Patients were allocated to the desflurane group or propofol group. The opioid remifentanil was administered intraoperatively in both groups. Blood samples were obtained from the arterial line preoperatively, immediately before and 5 min after tourniquet deflation, and at 1, 6, and 24 h, postoperatively. Serum syndecan-1, cytokines (interleukin-1beta, 6, 10, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha), and other laboratory values were investigated.  Results  Eighty patients were included in the final analysis. The change in syndecan-1 did not significantly differ between the desflurane and propofol groups (peak median level of syndecan-1; 754.5 pg/ml vs. 780.3 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.512). Laboratory values (serum cytokines, creatinine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate levels) were also similar between the two groups. Pulmonary oxygenation was briefly improved after tourniquet deflation in the desflurane group but was similar between the two groups begging at 1 h, postoperatively.  Conclusions  The effect of desflurane was not superior to that of propofol in protecting the EG from ischemia-reperfusion injury during total knee arthroplasty. This trial is registered with Trial Registry Number NCT02756715 (http://clinicaltrials.gov).
33531004/Fine tuning the glycolytic flux ratio of EP-bifido pathway for mevalonate production by enhancing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf) and CRISPRi suppressing 6-phosphofructose kinase (PfkA) in Escherichia coli Background Natural glycolysis encounters the decarboxylation of glucose partial oxidation product pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, where one-third of the carbon is lost at CO2. We previously constructed a carbon saving pathway, EP-bifido pathway by combining Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas Pathway, Pentose Phosphate Pathway and "bifid shunt", to generate high yield acetyl-CoA from glucose. However, the carbon conversion rate and reducing power of this pathway was not optimal, the flux ratio of EMP pathway and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) needs to be precisely and dynamically adjusted to improve the production of mevalonate (MVA). Result Here, we finely tuned the glycolytic flux ratio in two ways. First, we enhanced PPP flux for NADPH supply by replacing the promoter of zwf on the genome with a set of different strength promoters. Compared with the previous EP-bifido strains, the zwf-modified strains showed obvious differences in NADPH, NADH, and ATP synthesis levels. Among them, strain BP10BF accumulated 11.2 g/L of MVA after 72 h of fermentation and the molar conversion rate from glucose reached 62.2%. Second, pfkA was finely down-regulated by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) system. The MVA yield of the regulated strain BiB1F was 8.53 g/L, and the conversion rate from glucose reached 68.7%. Conclusion This is the highest MVA conversion rate reported in shaken flask fermentation. The CRISPRi and promoter fine-tuning provided an effective strategy for metabolic flux redistribution in many metabolic pathways and promotes the chemicals production.
33526024/Fruit ripening-associated leucylaminopeptidase with cysteinylglycine dipeptidase activity from durian suggests its involvement in glutathione recycling Background Durian (Durio zibethinus L.) is a highly popular fruit in Thailand and several other Southeast Asian countries. It is abundant in essential nutrients and sulphur-containing compounds such as glutathione (GSH) and gamma-glutamylcysteine (gamma-EC). Cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly) is produced by GSH catabolism and occurs in durian fruit pulp. Cysteine (Cys) is a precursor of sulphur-containing volatiles generated during fruit ripening. The aforementioned substances contribute to the strong odour and flavour of the ripe fruit. However, the genes encoding plant Cys-Gly dipeptidases are unknown. The aim of this study was to measure leucylaminopeptidase (LAP) activity in durian fruit pulp. Results We identified DzLAP1 and DzLAP2, which the former was highly expressed in the fruit pulp. DzLAP1 was expressed at various ripening stages and in response to ethephon/1-MCP treatment. Hence, DzLAP1 is active at the early stages of fruit ripening. DzLAP1 is a metalloenzyme ~ 63 kDa in size. It is activated by Mg2+ or Mn2+ and, like other LAPs, its optimal alkaline pH is 9.5. Kinetic studies revealed that DzLAP1 has Km = 1.62 mM for its preferred substrate Cys-Gly. DzLAP1-GFP was localised to the cytosol and targeted the plastids. In planta Cys-Gly hydrolysis was confirmed for Nicotiana benthamiana leaves co-infiltrated with Cys-Gly and expressing DzLAP1. Conclusions DzLAP1 has Cys-Gly dipeptidase activity in the gamma-glutamyl cycle. The present study revealed that the LAPs account for the high sulphur-containing compound levels identified in fully ripened durian fruit pulp.

33526073/Fluoxetine regulates eEF2 activity (phosphorylation) via HDAC1 inhibitory mechanism in an LPS-induced mouse model of depression Background Selective serotonin reuptaker inhibitors, including fluoxetine, are widely studied and prescribed antidepressants, while their exact molecular and cellular mechanism are yet to be defined. We investigated the involvement of HDAC1 and eEF2 in the antidepressant mechanisms of fluoxetine using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior model. Methods For in vivo analysis, mice were treated with LPS (2 mg/kg BW), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg BW), HDAC1 activator (Exifone: 54 mg/kg BW) and NH125 (1 mg/kg BW). Depressive-like behaviors were confirmed via behavior tests including OFT, FST, SPT, and TST. Cytokines were measured by ELISA while Iba-1 and GFAP expression were determined by immunofluorescence. Further, the desired gene expression was measured by immunoblotting. For in vitro analysis, BV2 cell lines were cultured; treated with LPS, exifone, and fluoxetine; collected; and analyzed. Results Mice treated with LPS displayed depression-like behaviors, pronounced neuroinflammation, increased HDAC1 expression, and reduced eEF2 activity, as accompanied by altered synaptogenic factors including BDNF, SNAP25, and PSD95. Fluoxetine treatment exhibited antidepressant effects and ameliorated the molecular changes induced by LPS. Exifone, a selective HDAC1 activator, reversed the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of fluoxetine both in vivo and in vitro, supporting a causing role of HDAC1 in neuroinflammation allied depression. Further molecular mechanisms underlying HDAC1 were explored with NH125, an eEF2K inhibitor, whose treatment reduced immobility time, altered pro-inflammatory cytokines, and NLRP3 expression. Moreover, NH125 treatment enhanced eEF2 and GSK3beta activities, BDNF, SNAP25, and PSD95 expression, but had no effects on HDAC1. Conclusions Our results showed that the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine may involve HDAC1-eEF2 related neuroinflammation and synaptogenesis.

33531006/Comparative genomics and transcriptomics analyses provide insights into the high yield and regulatory mechanism of Norvancomycin biosynthesis in Amycolatopsis orientalis NCPC 2-48 Background Norvancomycin has been widely used in clinic to treat against MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and MRSE (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) infections in China. Amycolatopsis orientalis NCPC 2-48, a high yield strain derived from A. orientalis CPCC 200066, has been applied in industrial large-scale production of norvancomycin by North China Pharmaceutical Group. However, the potential high-yield and regulatory mechanism involved in norvancomycin biosynthetic pathway has not yet been addressed. Results Here we sequenced and compared the genomes and transcriptomes of A. orientalis CPCC 200066 and NCPC 2-48. These two genomes are extremely similar with an identity of more than 99.9%, and no duplication and structural variation was found in the norvancomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Comparative transcriptomic analysis indicated that biosynthetic genes of norvancomycin, as well as some primary metabolite pathways for the biosynthetic precursors of norvancomycin were generally upregulated. AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1, two cluster-situated regulatory genes in norvancomycin cluster, were 23.3-fold and 5.8-fold upregulated in the high yield strain at 48 h, respectively. Over-expression of AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1 in CPCC 200066 resulted in an increase of norvancomycin production, indicating their positive roles in norvancomycin biosynthesis. Furthermore, AoStrR1 can regulate the production of norvancomycin by directly interacting with at least 8 promoters of norvancomycin biosynthetic genes or operons. Conclusion Our results suggested that the high yield of NCPC 2-48 can be ascribed to increased expression level of norvancomycin biosynthetic genes in its cluster as well as the genes responsible for the supply of its precursors. The norvancomycin biosynthetic genes are presumably regulated by AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1, of them AoStrR1 is possibly the ultimate pathway-specific regulator for the norvancomycin production. These results are helpful for further clarification of the holistic and pathway-specific regulatory mechanism of norvancomycin biosynthesis in the industrial production strain.
33531042/Evaluation of efflux pump activity and biofilm formation in multidrug resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from a Federal Medical Center in Nigeria Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa an opportunistic pathogen, is widely associated with nosocomial infections and exhibits resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance profile, biofilm formation and efflux pump activity of Pseudomonas strains isolated from clinical samples in Abeokuta Ogun state Nigeria. Methods Fifty suspected Pseudomonas isolates were characterized by standard biochemical tests and PCR using Pseudomonas species -specific primers. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by the disc diffusion method. Efflux pump activity screening was done by the ethidium bromide method and biofilm formation assay by the tissue plate method. Genes encoding biofilm formation (pslA & plsD) and efflux pump activity (mexA, mexB and oprM) were assayed by PCR. Results Thirty-nine Pseudomonas spp. were identified of which 35 were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 Pseudomonas spp. All 39 (100%) Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ceftazidime, cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Thirty-six (92%), 10(25.6%), 20 (51.2%), 11(28%) and 9(23%) of the isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin, imipenem, gentamicin, cefepime and aztreonam respectively. All the isolates had the ability to form biofilm and 11 (28%) of them were strong biofilm formers. They all (100%) harboured the pslA and pslD biofilm encoding genes. Varied relationships between biofilm formation and resistance to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, cefixime, gentamicin, imipenem, and aztreonam were observed. Only 23(59%) of the Pseudomonas isolates phenotypically exhibited efflux pump activity but mexA gene was detected in all 39 (100%) isolates while mexB and oprM genes were detected in 91%, 92%, and 88% of strong, moderate and weak biofilm formers respectively. Conclusion Multidrug resistance, biofilm and efflux pump capabilities in Pseudomonas aeruginosa have serious public health implications in the management of infections caused by this organism.
33530990/Synthesis of cembratriene-ol and cembratriene-diol in yeast via the MVA pathway Background Cembranoids are one kind of diterpenoids with multiple biological activities. The tobacco cembratriene-ol (CBT-ol) and cembratriene-diol (CBT-diol) have high anti-insect and anti-fungal activities, which is attracting great attentions for their potential usage in sustainable agriculture. Cembranoids were supposed to be formed through the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, yet the involvement of mevalonate (MVA) pathway in their synthesis remains unclear. Exploring the roles of MVA pathway in cembranoid synthesis could contribute not only to the technical approach but also to the molecular mechanism for cembranoid biosynthesis. Results We constructed vectors to express cembratriene-ol synthase (CBTS1) and its fusion protein (AD-CBTS1) containing an N-terminal GAL4 AD domain as a translation leader in yeast. Eventually, the modified enzyme AD-CBTS1 was successfully expressed, which further resulted in the production of CBT-ol in the yeast strain BY-T20 with enhanced MVA pathway for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) production but not in other yeast strains with low GGPP supply. Subsequently, CBT-diol was also synthesized by co-expression of the modified enzyme AD-CBTS1 and BD-CYP450 in the yeast strain BY-T20. Conclusions We demonstrated that yeast is insensitive to the tobacco anti-fungal compound CBT-ol or CBT-diol and could be applied to their biosynthesis. This study further established a feasibility for cembranoid production via the MVA pathway and provided an alternative bio-approach for cembranoid biosynthesis in microbes.
33522955/FOXC1 promotes HCC proliferation and metastasis by Upregulating DNMT3B to induce DNA Hypermethylation of CTH promoter Background Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1), as a member of the FOX family, is important for promote HCC invasion and metastasis. FOX family protein lays a pivotal role in metabolism. ROS is involved in tumor progression and is associated with the expression of lots of transcription factors. We next explored the mechanism underlying FOXC1 modulating the metabolism and ROS hemostasis in HCC. Methods We used amino acids arrays to verify which metabolism is involved in FOXC1-induced HCC. The kits were used to detect the ROS levels in HCC cells with over-expression or down-expression of FOXC1. After identified the downstream target genes and candidate pathway which regulated by FOXC1 during HCC progression in vitro and in vivo, we used western blot, immunohistochemistry, bisulfite genomic sequencing, methylation-specific PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and luciferase reporter assays to explore the relationship of FOXC1 and downstream genes. Moreover, the correlation between FOXC1 and target genes and the correlation between target genes and the recurrence and overall survival were analyzed in two independent human HCC cohorts. Results Here, we reported that FOXC1 could inhibit the cysteine metabolism and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by regulating cysteine metabolism-related genes, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH). Overexpression of CTH significantly suppressed FOXC1-induced HCC proliferation, invasion and metastasis, while the reduction in cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis caused by the inhibition of FOXC1 could be reversed by knockdown of CTH. Meanwhile, FOXC1 upregulated de novo DNA methylase 3B (DNMT3B) expression to induce DNA hypermethylation of CTH promoter, which resulted in low expression of CTH in HCC cells. Moreover, low levels of ROS induced by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) which is an antioxidant inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities mediated by FOXC1 overexpression, whereas high levels of ROS induced by L-Buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) rescued the suppression results mediated by FOXC1 knockdown. Our study demonstrated that the overexpression of FOXC1 that was induced by the ROS dependent on the extracellular regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)- phospho-ETS Transcription Factor 1 (p-ELK1) pathway. In human HCC tissues, FOXC1 expression was positively correlated with oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), p-ELK1 and DNMT3B expression, but negatively correlated with CTH expression. HCC patients with positive co-expression of 8-OHdG/FOXC1 or p-ELK1/FOXC1 or FOXC1/DNMT3B had the worst prognosis, whereas HCC patients who had positive FOXC1 and negative CTH expression exhibited the worst prognosis. Conclusion In a word, we clarify that the positive feedback loop of ROS-FOXC1-cysteine metabolism-ROS is important for promoting liver cancer proliferation and metastasis, and this pathway may provide a prospective clinical treatment approach for HCC.

33522916/Tunable expression rate control of a growth-decoupled T7 expression system by l-arabinose only Background Precise regulation of gene expression is of utmost importance for the production of complex membrane proteins (MP), enzymes or other proteins toxic to the host cell. In this article we show that genes under control of a normally Isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible PT7-lacO promoter can be induced solely with l-arabinose in a newly constructed Escherichia coli expression host BL21-AI<gp2>, a strain based on the recently published approach of bacteriophage inspired growth-decoupled recombinant protein production. Results Here, we show that BL21-AI<gp2> is able to precisely regulate protein production rates on a cellular level in an l-arabinose concentration-dependent manner and simultaneously allows for reallocation of metabolic resources due to l-arabinose induced growth decoupling by the phage derived inhibitor peptide Gp2. We have successfully characterized the system under relevant fed-batch like conditions in microscale cultivation (800 microL) and generated data proofing a relevant increase in specific yields for 6 different Escherichia coli derived MP-GFP fusion proteins by using online-GFP signals, FACS analysis, SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Conclusions In all cases tested, BL21-AI<gp2> outperformed the parental strain BL21-AI, operated in growth-associated production mode. Specific MP-GFP fusion proteins yields have been improved up to 2.7-fold. Therefore, this approach allows for fine tuning of MP production or expression of multi-enzyme pathways where e.g. particular stoichiometries have to be met to optimize product flux.
33529247/The impact of different Zinc (Zn) levels on growth and nutrient uptake of Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) grown under salinity stress Salinity is among the most important abiotic stresses, which negatively affect growth, nutrient uptake and yield of crop plants. Application of different micronutrients, particularly zinc (Zn) have the potential to ameliorate the negative impacts of salinity stress. However, the role of Zn in improving salinity tolerance of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of different Zn levels (0, 5 and 10 mg kg-1) on growth and nutrient acquisition traits of basil under different salinity levels (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% NaCl). Data relating to biomass production, chlorophyll index, sodium (Na), potassium (K) uptake, K/Na ratio, Zn, copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) uptake were recorded. Increasing salinity level reduced biomass production, chlorophyll index and nutrient uptake traits (except for Na and Fe accumulation) of basil. Zinc application (10 mg kg-1) improved biomass production, chlorophyll index and nutrient acquisition traits under normal as well as saline conditions. The reduction in chlorophyll index and biomass production was higher under 0 and 5 mg kg-1 than 10 mg kg-1 Zn application. The K concentration decreased under increasing salinity; however, Zn application improved K uptake under normal as well as saline conditions. Different growth and nutrient acquisition traits had negative correlations with Na accumulation; however, no positive correlation was recorded among growth and nutrient uptake traits. The results revealed that Zn application could improve the salinity tolerance of basil. However, actual biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in Zn-induced salinity tolerance warrant further investigation.
33529222/Vasomotor action of androgens in the mesenteric artery of hypertensive rats. Role of perivascular innervation Androgens may exert cardiovascular protective actions by regulating the release and function of different vascular factors. In addition, testosterone (TES) and its 5-reduced metabolites, 5alpha- and 5beta-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha- and 5beta-DHT) induce vasorelaxant and hypotensive effects. Furthermore, hypertension has been reported to alter the release and function of the neurotransmitters nitric oxide (NO), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and noradrenaline (NA). Since the mesenteric arteries possess a dense perivascular innervation and significantly regulate total peripheral vascular resistance, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of TES, 5alpha- and 5beta-DHT on the neurogenic release and vasomotor function of NO, CGRP and NA. For this purpose, the superior mesenteric artery from male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats was used to analyze: (i) the effect of androgens (10 nM, incubated for 30 min) on the neurogenic release of NO, CGRP and NA and (ii) the vasoconstrictor-response to NA and the vasodilator responses to the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and exogenous CGRP. The results showed that TES, 5alpha- or 5beta-DHT did not modify the release of NO, CGRP or NA induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in the arteries of SHR; however, in the arteries of WKY rats androgens only caused an increase in EFS-induced NO release. Moreover, TES, and especially 5beta-DHT, increased the vasodilator response induced by SNP and CGRP in the arteries of SHR. These findings could be contributing to the hypotensive/antihypertensive efficacy of 5beta-DHT previously described in conscious SHR and WKY rats, pointing to 5beta- DHT as a potential drug for the treatment of hypertension.
33529249/Cross-effect of TRPV1 and EP3 receptor on coughs and bronchopulmonary C-neural activities Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced coughs in vivo and vagal nerve depolarization in vitro are inhibited by systemic and local administration of prostaglandin EP3 receptor (L-798106) and TRPV1 antagonists (JNJ 17203212). These results indicate a modulating effect of TRPV1 on the EP3 receptor-mediated cough responses to PGE2 likely through the vagal sensory nerve. This study aimed to determine whether 1) inhalation of aerosolized JNJ 17203212 and L-798106 affected cough responses to citric acid (CA, mainly stimulating TRPV1) and PGE2; 2) TRPV1 and EP3 receptor morphologically are co-expressed and electrophysiologically functioned in the individual of vagal pulmonary C-neurons (cell bodies of bronchopulmonary C-fibers in the nodose/jugular ganglia); and 3) there was a cross-effect of TRPV1 and EP3 receptor on these neural excitations. To this end, aerosolized CA or PGE2 was inhaled by unanesthetized guinea pigs pretreated without or with each antagonist given in aerosol form. Immunofluorescence was applied to identify the co-expression of TRPV1 and EP3 receptor in vagal pulmonary C-neurons (retrogradely traced by DiI). Whole-cell voltage patch clamp approach was used to detect capsaicin (CAP)- and PGE2-induced currents in individual vagal pulmonary C-neurons and determine the effects of the TRPV1 and EP3 receptor antagonists on the evoked currents. We found that PGE2-induced cough was attenuated by JNJ 17203212 or L-798106 and CA-evoked cough greatly suppressed only by JNJ 17203212. Approximately 1/4 of vagal pulmonary C-neurons co-expressed EP3 with a cell size < 20 mum. Both CAP- and PGE2-induced currents could be recorded in the individuals of some vagal pulmonary C-neurons. The former was largely inhibited only by JNJ 17203212, while the latter was suppressed by JNJ 17203212 or L-798106. The similarity of the cross-effect of both antagonists on cough and vagal pulmonary C-neural activity suggests that a subgroup of vagal pulmonary C-neurons co-expressing TRPV1 and EP3 receptor is, at least in part, responsible for the cough response to PGE2.
33529248/Antibiofilm and antipersister activity of acetic acid against extensively drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAW1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ESKAPE pathogen associated with difficult-to-treat burn wound and surgical-site infections. This study aimed to characterise an extensively drug resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa isolate (designated PAW1) and to investigate the antibiofilm and antipersister effect of acetic acid on PAW1. PAW1 was identified using biotypic (VITEK) and genotypic (16S rDNA) analysis. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc susceptibility testing showed high level resistance against all antibiotics from classes including beta lactams, cephems, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. It was therefore identified as extensively drug resistant (XDR), showing resistance to all antibiotics except for, aminoglycoside (gentamicin and netilmicin) and lipopeptides (polymyxin B). Time kill assays showed antibiotic tolerant, persister cell formation in presence of 100X MICs of gentamicin and polymyxin B. Other virulence traits such as ability to produce lipase, protease, haemolysin, and siderophores and to form biofilms were additional factors which may contribute to its pathogenicity. PAW1 showed promising susceptibility against acetic acid with MIC and minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration of 0.156% (v/v). Percent viability of PAW1 was dependent on dose and treatment time of acetic acid. 0.625% acetic acid treatment of 5 minutes was effective in killing >90% planktonic cells showing lesser toxicity to L929 cells (IC50 = 0.625%). Biofilm disruption caused due to acetic acid was also dose dependent, showing 40.57% disruption after treatment with 0.625% acetic acid for 5 minutes. FESEM imaging and live dead staining of planktonic and biofilm forms of PAW1 confirmed that acetic acid treatment caused 19.04% of cell shrinkage and disruption of extracellular matrix resulting in killing of cells. Antipersister activity of acetic acid was demonstrated by showing complete killing of PAW1 at 4X MIC. Overall, this study characterised an XDR isolate P. aeruginosa showing resistance and tolerance to various antibiotics. Antipersister and antibiofilm effect of acetic acid demonstrates the importance of forgotten topical agents as an effective strategy to treat XDR pathogens.
33534843/Protection of dopamine neurons by CDNF and neurturin variant N4 against MPP+ in dissociated cultures from rat mesencephalon Parkinson's disease is associated with the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in ventral mesencephalon. We have previously reported that no single neurotrophic factor we tested protected DA neurons from the dopaminergic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in dissociated cultures isolated from the P0 rat substantia nigra, but that a combination of five neurotrophic factors was protective. We now report that cerebral DA neurotrophic factor (CDNF) and a variant of neurturin (NRTN), N4, were also not protective when provided alone but were protective when added together. In cultures isolated from the substantia nigra, MPP+ (10 muM) decreased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells to 41.7 +- 5.4% of vehicle control. Although treatment of cultures with 100 ng/ml of either CDNF or N4 individually before and after toxin exposure did not significantly increase survival in MPP+-treated cultures, when the two trophic factors were added together at 100 ng/ml each, survival of cells was increased 28.2 +- 6.1% above the effect of MPP+ alone. In cultures isolated from the ventral tegmental area, another DA rich area, a higher dose of MPP+ (1 mM) was required to produce an EC50 in TH-positive cells but, as in the substantia nigra, only the combination of CDNF and N4 (100 ng/ml each) was successful at increasing the survival of these cells compared to MPP+ alone (by 22.5 +- 3.5%). These data support previous findings that CDNF and N4 may be of therapeutic value for treatment of PD, but suggest that they may need to be administered together.
33531393/Zn2+ Intoxication of Mycobacterium marinum during Dictyostelium discoideum Infection Is Counteracted by Induction of the Pathogen Zn2+ Exporter CtpC Microelements are essential for the function of the innate immune system. A deficiency in zinc or copper results in an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. ABSTRACT Macrophages use diverse strategies to restrict intracellular pathogens, including either depriving the bacteria of (micro)nutrients such as transition metals or intoxicating them via metal accumulation. Little is known about the chemical warfare between Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and its hosts. We use the professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum to investigate the role of Zn2+ during M. marinum infection. We show that M. marinum senses toxic levels of Zn2+ and responds by upregulating one of its isoforms of the Zn2+ efflux transporter CtpC. Deletion of ctpC (MMAR_1271) leads to growth inhibition in broth supplemented with Zn2+ as well as reduced intracellular growth. Both phenotypes were fully rescued by constitutive ectopic expression of the Mtb CtpC orthologue demonstrating that MMAR_1271 is the functional CtpC Zn2+ efflux transporter in M. marinum. Infection leads to the accumulation of Zn2+ inside the Mycobacterium-containing vacuole (MCV), achieved by the induction and recruitment of the D. discoideum Zn2+ efflux pumps ZntA and ZntB. In cells lacking ZntA, there is further attenuation of M. marinum growth, presumably due to a compensatory efflux of Zn2+ into the MCV, carried out by ZntB, the main Zn2+ transporter in endosomes and phagosomes. Counterintuitively, bacterial growth is also impaired in zntB KO cells, in which MCVs appear to accumulate less Zn2+ than in wild-type cells, suggesting restriction by other Zn2+-mediated mechanisms. Absence of CtpC further epistatically attenuates the intracellular proliferation of M. marinum in zntA and zntB KO cells, confirming that mycobacteria face noxious levels of Zn2+.
33531396/Acetylene-Fueled Trichloroethene Reductive Dechlorination in a Groundwater Enrichment Culture Understanding the complex metabolisms of microbial communities in contaminated groundwaters is a challenge. PCE and TCE are among the most common groundwater contaminants in the United States that, when exposed to certain minerals, exhibit a unique abiotic degradation pathway in which C2H2 is a product. ABSTRACT In aquifers, acetylene (C2H2) is a product of abiotic degradation of trichloroethene (TCE) catalyzed by in situ minerals. C2H2 can, in turn, inhibit multiple microbial processes including TCE dechlorination and metabolisms that commonly support dechlorination, in addition to supporting the growth of acetylenotrophic microorganisms. Previously, C2H2 was shown to support TCE reductive dechlorination in synthetic, laboratory-constructed cocultures containing the acetylenotroph Pelobacter sp. strain SFB93 and Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 or strain BAV1. In this study, we demonstrate TCE and perchloroethene (PCE) reductive dechlorination by a microbial community enriched from contaminated groundwater and amended with C2H2 as the sole electron donor and organic carbon source. The metagenome of the stable, enriched community was analyzed to elucidate putative community functions. A novel anaerobic acetylenotroph in the phylum Actinobacteria was identified using metagenomic analysis. These results demonstrate that the coupling of acetylenotrophy and reductive dechlorination can occur in the environment with native bacteria and broaden our understanding of biotransformation at contaminated sites containing both TCE and C2H2.
33531402/(p)ppGpp/GTP and Malonyl-CoA Modulate Staphylococcus aureus Adaptation to FASII Antibiotics and Provide a Basis for Synergistic Bi-Therapy Staphylococcus aureus is a major human bacterial pathogen for which new inhibitors are urgently needed. Antibiotic development has centered on the fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway, which provides the building blocks for bacterial membrane phospholipids. ABSTRACT Fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII) enzymes are considered valid targets for antimicrobial drug development against the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, incorporation of host fatty acids confers FASII antibiotic adaptation that compromises prospective treatments. S. aureus adapts to FASII inhibitors by first entering a nonreplicative latency period, followed by outgrowth. Here, we used transcriptional fusions and direct metabolite measurements to investigate the factors that dictate the duration of latency prior to outgrowth. We show that stringent response induction leads to repression of FASII and phospholipid synthesis genes. (p)ppGpp induction inhibits synthesis of malonyl-CoA, a molecule that derepresses FapR, a key regulator of FASII and phospholipid synthesis. Anti-FASII treatment also triggers transient expression of (p)ppGpp-regulated genes during the anti-FASII latency phase, with concomitant repression of FapR regulon expression. These effects are reversed upon outgrowth. GTP depletion, a known consequence of the stringent response, also occurs during FASII latency, and is proposed as the common signal linking these responses. We next showed that anti-FASII treatment shifts malonyl-CoA distribution between its interactants FapR and FabD, toward FapR, increasing expression of the phospholipid synthesis genes plsX and plsC during outgrowth. We conclude that components of the stringent response dictate malonyl-CoA availability in S. aureus FASII regulation, and contribute to latency prior to anti-FASII-adapted outgrowth. A combinatory approach, coupling a (p)ppGpp inducer and an anti-FASII, blocks S. aureus outgrowth, opening perspectives for bi-therapy treatment.
33531388/Pseudomonas aeruginosa Uses c-di-GMP Phosphodiesterases RmcA and MorA To Regulate Biofilm Maintenance Recent advances in our understanding of c-di-GMP signaling have provided key insights into the regulation of biofilms. Despite an improved understanding of how biofilms initially form, the processes that facilitate the long-term maintenance of these multicellular communities remain opaque. ABSTRACT While the early stages of biofilm formation have been well characterized, less is known about the requirements for Pseudomonas aeruginosa to maintain a mature biofilm. We utilized a P. aeruginosa-phage interaction to identify rmcA and morA, two genes which encode bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP)-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and are important for the regulation of biofilm maintenance. Deletion of these genes initially results in an elevated biofilm phenotype characterized by increased production of c-di-GMP, Pel polysaccharide, and/or biofilm biomass. In contrast to the wild-type strain, these mutants were unable to maintain the biofilm when exposed to carbon-limited conditions. The susceptibility to nutrient limitation, as well as subsequent loss of biofilm viability of these mutants, was phenotypically reproduced with a stringent response mutant (DeltarelA DeltaspoT), indicating that the DeltarmcA and DeltamorA mutants may be unable to appropriately respond to nutrient limitation. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that RmcA and MorA physically interact with the Pel biosynthesis machinery, supporting a model whereby unregulated Pel biosynthesis contributes to the death of the DeltarmcA and DeltamorA mutant strains in an established biofilm under nutrient limitation. These findings provide evidence that c-di-GMP-mediated regulation is required for mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa to effectively respond to changing availability of nutrients. Furthermore, the PDEs involved in biofilm maintenance are distinct from those required for establishing a biofilm, suggesting that a wide variety of c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes in organisms such as P. aeruginosa allows for discrete control over the formation, maintenance or dispersion of biofilms.
33531390/A Phosphonate Natural Product Made by Pantoea ananatis is Necessary and Sufficient for the Hallmark Lesions of Onion Center Rot Pantoea ananatis is a significant plant pathogen that targets a number of important crops, a problem that is compounded by the absence of effective treatments to prevent its spread. Our identification of pantaphos as the key virulence factor in onion center rot suggests a variety of approaches that could be employed to address this significant plant disease. ABSTRACT Pantoea ananatis is the primary cause of onion center rot. Genetic data suggest that a phosphonic acid natural product is required for pathogenesis; however, the nature of the molecule is unknown. Here, we show that P. ananatis produces at least three phosphonates, two of which were purified and structurally characterized. The first, designated pantaphos, was shown to be 2-(hydroxy[phosphono]methyl)maleate; the second, a probable biosynthetic precursor, was shown to be 2-(phosphonomethyl)maleate. Purified pantaphos is both necessary and sufficient for the hallmark lesions of onion center rot. Moreover, when tested against mustard seedlings, the phytotoxic activity of pantaphos was comparable to the widely used herbicides glyphosate and phosphinothricin. Pantaphos was also active against a variety of human cell lines but was significantly more toxic to glioblastoma cells. Pantaphos showed little activity when tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi.
33536025/Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for anthranilate and methyl anthranilate production Background Anthranilate is a platform chemical used by the industry in the synthesis of a broad range of high-value products, such as dyes, perfumes and pharmaceutical compounds. Currently anthranilate is produced via chemical synthesis from non-renewable resources. Biological synthesis would allow the use of renewable carbon sources and avoid accumulation of toxic by-products. Microorganisms produce anthranilate as an intermediate in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. Several prokaryotic microorganisms have been engineered to overproduce anthranilate but attempts to engineer eukaryotic microorganisms for anthranilate production are scarce. Results We subjected Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a widely used eukaryotic production host organism, to metabolic engineering for anthranilate production. A single gene knockout was sufficient to trigger anthranilate accumulation both in minimal and SCD media and the titer could be further improved by subsequent genomic alterations. The effects of the modifications on anthranilate production depended heavily on the growth medium used. By growing an engineered strain in SCD medium an anthranilate titer of 567.9 mg l-1 was obtained, which is the highest reported with an eukaryotic microorganism. Furthermore, the anthranilate biosynthetic pathway was extended by expression of anthranilic acid methyltransferase 1 from Medicago truncatula. When cultivated in YPD medium, this pathway extension enabled production of the grape flavor compound methyl anthranilate in S. cerevisiae at 414 mg l-1. Conclusions In this study we have engineered metabolism of S. cerevisiae for improved anthranilate production. The resulting strains may serve as a basis for development of efficient production host organisms for anthranilate-derived compounds. In order to demonstrate suitability of the engineered S. cerevisiae strains for production of such compounds, we successfully extended the anthranilate biosynthesis pathway to synthesis of methyl anthranilate.
33536031/2D LDH-MoS2 clay nanosheets: synthesis, catalase-mimic capacity, and imaging-guided tumor photo-therapy Owing to the hypoxia status of the tumor, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during photodynamic therapy (PDT) of the tumor is less efficient. Herein, a facile method which involves the synthesis of Mg-Mn-Al layered double hydroxides (LDH) clay with MoS2 doping in the surface and anionic layer space of LDH was presented, to integrate the photo-thermal effect of MoS2 and imaging and catalytic functions of Mg-Mn-Al LDH. The designed LDH-MoS2 (LMM) clay composite was further surface-coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to maintain the colloidal stability of LMM in physiological environment. A photosensitizer, chlorin e6 (Ce6), was absorbed at the surface and anionic layer space of LMM@BSA. In the LMM formulation, the magnetic resonance imaging of Mg-Mn-Al LDH was enhanced thanks to the reduced and acid microenvironment of the tumor. Notably, the ROS production and PDT efficiency of Ce6 were significantly improved, because LMM@BSA could catalyze the decomposing of the overexpressed H2O2 in tumors to produce oxygen. The biocompatible LMM@BSA that played the synergism with tumor microenvironment is a promising candidate for the effective treatment of cancer.
33535983/Triple null mutations in starch synthase SSIIa gene homoeologs lead to high amylose and resistant starch in hexaploid wheat Background Lack of nutritionally appropriate foods is one of the leading causes of obesity in the US and worldwide. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) provides 20% of the calories consumed daily across the globe. The nutrients in the wheat grain come primarily from the starch composed of amylose and amylopectin. Resistant starch content, which is known to have significant human health benefits, can be increased by modifying starch synthesis pathways. Starch synthase enzyme SSIIa, also known as starch granule protein isoform-1 (SGP-1), is integral to the biosynthesis of the branched and readily digestible glucose polymer amylopectin. The goal of this work was to develop a triple null mutant genotype for SSIIa locus in the elite hard red winter wheat variety 'Jagger' and evaluate the effect of the knock-out mutations on resistant starch content in grains with respect to wild type. Results Knock-out mutations in SSIIa in the three genomes of wheat variety 'Jagger' were identified using TILLING. Subsequently, these loss-of function mutations on A, B, and D genomes were combined by crossing to generate a triple knockout mutant genotype Jag-ssiia- ABD. The Jag-ssiia- ABD had an amylose content of 35.70% compared to 31.15% in Jagger, leading to ~ 118% increase in resistant starch in the Jag-ssiia- ABD genotype of Jagger wheat. The single individual genome mutations also had various effects on starch composition. Conclusions Our full null Jag-ssiia- ABD mutant showed a significant increase in RS without the shriveled grain phenotype seen in other ssiia knockouts in elite wheat cultivars. Moreover, this study shows the potential for developing nutritionally improved foods in a non-GM approach. Since all the mutants have been developed in an elite wheat cultivar, their adoption in production and supply will be feasible in future.

33219923/Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of human cathelicidin active fragment KR-12 in the mouse models of colitis: a novel potential therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases Introduction Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic gastrointestinal tract disorders with complex etiology, with intestinal dysbiosis as the most prominent factor. In this study, we assessed the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions of the human cathelicidin LL-37 and its shortest active fragment, KR-12 in the mouse models of colitis. Materials and methods Mouse models of colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) were used in the study. The extent of inflammation was evaluated based on the macro- and microscopic scores, quantification of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and microbiological analysis of stool samples. Results A preliminary study with LL-37 and KR-12 (1 mg/kg, ip, twice daily) showed a decrease in macroscopic and ulcer scores in the acute TNBS-induced model of colitis. We observed that KR-12 (5 mg/kg, ip, twice daily) reduced microscopic and ulcer scores in the semi-chronic and chronic TNBS-induced models of colitis compared with inflamed mice. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative changes in colonic microbiota were observed: KR-12 (5 mg/kg, ip, twice daily) decreased the overall number of bacteria, Escherichia coli and coli group bacteria. In the semi-chronic DSS-induced model, KR-12 attenuated intestinal inflammation as demonstrated by a reduction in macroscopic score and colon damage score and MPO activity. Conclusions We demonstrated that KR-12 alleviates inflammation in four different mouse models of colitis what suggests KR-12 and cathelicidins as a whole are worth being considered as a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of IBD.
32936422/Neutral ceramidase is a marker for cognitive performance in rats and monkeys Background Ceramides are lipid molecules determining cell integrity and intercellular signaling, and thus, involved in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the role of particular enzymes of the ceramide metabolism in the mechanisms of normal behavioral plasticity. Here, we studied the contribution of neutral ceramidase (NC), one of the main enzymes mediating ceramide degradation, in the mechanisms of learning and memory in rats and non-human primates. Methods Naive Wistar rats and black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) were tested in several tests for short- and long-term memory and then divided into groups with various memory performance. The activities of NC and acid ceramidase (AC) were measured in these animals. Additionally, anxiety and depression-like behavior and brain levels of monoamines were assessed in the rats. Results We observed a predictive role of NC activity in the blood serum for superior performance of long-term object memory tasks in both species. A brain area analysis suggested that high NC activity in the ventral mesencephalon (VM) predicts better short-term memory performance in rats. High NC activity in the VM was also associated with worse long-term object memory, which might be mediated by an enhanced depression-like state and a monoaminergic imbalance. Conclusions Altogether, these data suggest a role for NC in short- and long-term memory of various mammalian species. Serum activity of NC may possess a predictive role in the assessing the performance of certain types of memory.

33025395/Selected single-nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B encoding subunits of the NMDA receptor are not biomarkers of schizophrenia resistant to clozapine: exploratory study Background Schizophrenia is a common mental illness whose pathogenesis is still unknown. The vulnerability and stress model in schizophrenia assume that susceptibility to the disease is mainly associated with genes. Of the five symptomatic dimensions of schizophrenia, cognitive impairment appears to be most associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to explore whether selected nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B encoding subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) receptor occur in a selected group of patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia with cognitive impairment. Methods The study included 45 patients diagnosed with super refractory schizophrenia, all with cognitive deficits and chronically psychotic. DNA fragments including the studied polymorphisms of the NMDA receptors subunit genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subjected to sequencing. Results The study did not confirm the presence of any of the four selected single-nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B subunits of NMDA-R in the study group. Conclusion Results of the study indicated that the selected single-nucleotide variants are not associated both with resistance to clozapine and the presence of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. It is possible, however, that a more extensive sequencing along with analyzing the expression of these genes may reveal different single-nucleotide variants than those assumed in the study.
33237434/Exploratory study of selected nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B encoding subunits of the NMDA receptor in a targeted group of schizophrenia patients with chronic cognitive impairment Background Schizophrenia is a mental disease that affects approximately 1% of the population. Despite over 100 years of research, its pathomechanism has still not been clarified. Cognitive deficits, which are one of the symptomatic dimensions of schizophrenia, usually appear a few years before the first psychotic episode. Therefore, this is why they are probably the clinical manifestation of the primary pathomechanism of schizophrenia. It is also supposed that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) insufficiency in the prefrontal cortex is responsible for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The study aimed to examine whether four selected single nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B encoding NMDA-R subunits, of which two have not been tested before, are linked with the selected clinical phenotype of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Methods The study included the targeted group of 117 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, all with cognitive deficits and in symptomatic remission. DNA fragments including the studied polymorphisms of the NMDA receptors subunit genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subjected to sequencing. Results The study did not confirm the presence of any of the four selected single nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B subunits of NMDA-R. Conclusions The finding indicates that selected single nucleotide variants in GRIN2A and GRIN2B encoding subunits of the NMDA receptor are not associated with the presence of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
32700246/Xanthotoxin reverses Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in zebrafish larvae and mice models: a comparative study Background The aim of this study is to preliminary evaluate the antiparkinsonian activity of furanocoumarin:xanthotoxin, in two behavioral animal models, zebrafish larvae treated with 6-hydroxydopamine and mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in order to compare both models. Methods Xanthotoxin was isolated from Pastinaca sativa L. (Apiaceae) fruits. Then, the compound was administered by immersion to zebrafish 5 days after fertilization (dpf) larvae or intraperitoneally to male Swiss mice, as a potential therapeutic agent against locomotor impairments. Results Acute xanthotoxin administration at the concentration of 7.5 microM reversed locomotor activity impairments in 5-dpf zebrafish larvae. In mice model, acute xanthotoxin administration alleviated movement impairments at the concentration of 25 mg/kg. Conclusions The similar activity of the same substance in two different animal models indicates their compatibility and proves the potential of in vivo bioassays based on zebrafish models. Results of our study indicate that xanthotoxin may be considered as a potential lead compound in the discovery of antiparkinsonian drugs.
32888176/Levomepromazine and clozapine induce the main human cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 Background Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many important endogenous substrates (steroids, melatonin), drugs and toxic xenobiotics. Their induction accelerates drug metabolism and elimination. The present study aimed at examining the inducing abilities of two antipsychotic drugs levomepromazine and clozapine for the main CYPs. Methods The experiments were performed using cryopreserved human hepatocytes. The hepatotoxicity of levomepromazine and clozapine was assessed after exposure to the neuroleptics (LDH test). CYP activities were measured in the incubation medium using the CYP-specific reactions: caffeine 3-N-demethylation (CYP1A1/2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), perazine N-demethylation (CYP2C19) and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4). In parallel, CYP mRNA levels were measured in neuroleptic-treated hepatocytes. Results The results indicate that levomepromazine and clozapine induce the expression of main CYP enzyme CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Levomepromazine and clozapine at concentrations of 2.5 and 10 microM, respectively, caused a significant increase in the mRNA level and activity of CYP3A4. Both neuroleptics did not produce any changes in CYP1A1/2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Conclusion Levomepromazine and clozapine induce CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes in vitro. Further in vivo studies are advisable to confirm the CYP3A4 induction by levomepromazine and clozapine in the liver, and to assess the effect of these drugs on their own metabolism and on the biotransformation of other co-administered drugs which are the CYP3A4 substrates.
33025394/Polygonogram with isobolographic synergy for three-drug combinations of phenobarbital with second-generation antiepileptic drugs in the tonic-clonic seizure model in mice Background Combination therapy consisting of two or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is usually prescribed for patients with refractory epilepsy. The drug-drug interactions, which may occur among currently available AEDs, are the principal criterion taken by physicians when prescribing the AED combination to the patients. Unfortunately, the number of possible three-drug combinations tremendously increases along with the clinical approval of novel AEDs. Aim To isobolographically characterize three-drug interactions of phenobarbital (PB) with lamotrigine (LTG), oxcarbazepine (OXC), pregabalin (PGB) and topiramate (TPM), the maximal electroshock-induced (MES) seizure model was used in male albino Swiss mice. Materials and method The MES-induced seizures in mice were generated by alternating current delivered via auricular electrodes. To classify interactions for 6 various three-drug combinations of AEDs (i.e., PB + TPM + PGB, PB + OXC + TPM, PB + LTG + TPM, PB + OXC + PGB, PB + LTG + PGB and PB + LTG + OXC), the type I isobolographic analysis was used. Total brain concentrations of PB were measured by fluorescent polarization immunoassay technique. Results The three-drug mixtures of PB + TPM + PGB, PB + OXC + TPM, PB + LTG + TPM, PB + OXC + PGB, PB + LTG + PGB and PB + LTG + OXC protected the male albino Swiss mice from MES-induced seizures. All the observed interactions in this seizure model were supra-additive (synergistic) (p < 0.001), except for the combination of PB + LTG + OXC, which was additive. It was unable to show the impact of the studied second-generation AEDs on total brain content of PB in mice. Conclusions The synergistic interactions among PB and LTG, OXC, PGB and TPM in the mouse MES model are worthy of being transferred to clinical trials, especially for the patients with drug resistant epilepsy, who would benefit these treatment options.
33546663/Evaluation of antioxidant and anticancer activity of crude extract and different fractions of Chlorella vulgaris axenic culture grown under various concentrations of copper ions Background Chlorella vulgaris is a microalga potentially used for pharmaceutical, animal feed, food supplement, aquaculture and cosmetics. The current study aims to study the antioxidant and prooxidant effect of Chlorella vulgaris cultivated under various conc. of copper ions. Methods The axenic green microalgal culture of Chlorella vulgaris was subjected to copper stress conditions (0.00, 0.079, 0.158, 0.316 and 0.632 mg/L). The growth rate was measured at OD680 nm and by dry weight (DW). Moreover, the Antioxidant activity against DPPH and ABTS radical, pigments and phytochemical compounds of the crude extracts (methylene chloride: Methanol, 1:1) were evaluated. The promising Cu crude extract (0.316 mg/L) further fractionated into twenty-one fractions by silica gel column chromatography using hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate as a mobile phase. Results The obtained results reported that nine out of these fractions exhibited more than 50% antioxidant activity and anticancer activity against Hela cancer cell lines. Based on IC50, fraction No. 7 was found to be the most effective fraction possessing a significant increase in both antioxidant and anticancer potency. Separation of active compound (s) in fraction No 7 was performed using precoated silica gel plates (TLC F254) with ethyl acetate: hexane (9:1 v/v) as mobile phase. Confirmation of active compound separation was achieved by two-dimensional TLC and visualization of the separated compound by UV lamp. The complete identification of the separated active compound was performed by UV- Vis- spectrophotometric absorption, IR, MS, H1-NMRT C13-NMR. The isolated compound ((2E,7R,11R)-3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecenol) have high antioxidant activity with IC50 (10.59 mug/ml) against DPPH radical assay and comparable to the capacities of the positive controls, Butylated hydroxy toluene [BHT] (IC50 11.2 mug/ml) and Vitamin C (IC50 12.9 mug/ml). Furthermore, pure isolated compound exhibited a potent anticancer activity against Hela cell line with IC50 (4.38 mug/ml) compared to Doxorubicin (DOX) as synthetic drug (13.3 mug/ml). In addition, the interaction of the pure compound with Hela cancer cell line and gene expression were evaluated. Conclusions The authors recommend cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris in large scale under various stress conditions for use the crude extracts and semi purified fractions for making a pharmaco-economic value in Egypt and other countries.
33546730/Effect of sodium bicarbonate contribution on energy metabolism during exercise: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background The effects of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) on anaerobic and aerobic capacity are commonly acknowledged as unclear due to the contrasting evidence thus, the present study analyzes the contribution of NaHCO3 to energy metabolism during exercise. Methods Following a search through five databases, 17 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMDs) were performed using a random-effects model to determine the effects of NaHCO3 supplementation on energy metabolism. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted for the anaerobic-based exercise (assessed by changes in pH, bicarbonate ion [HCO3-], base excess [BE] and blood lactate [BLa]) vs. aerobic-based exercise (assessed by changes in oxygen uptake [VO2], carbon dioxide production [VCO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PO2] and partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO2]). Results The meta-analysis indicated that NaHCO3 ingestion improves pH (SMD = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.79, P < 0.001; I2 = 69%), HCO3- (SMD = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.17, P < 0.001; I2 = 80%), BE (SMD = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.19, P < 0.001, I2 = 77%), BLa (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.11, P < 0.001, I2 = 68%) and PCO2 (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.90, P = 0.009, I2 = 0%) but there were no differences between VO2, VCO2 and PO2 compared with the placebo condition. Conclusions This meta-analysis has found that the anaerobic metabolism system (AnMS), especially the glycolytic but not the oxidative system during exercise is affected by ingestion of NaHCO3. The ideal way is to ingest it is in a gelatin capsule in the acute mode and to use a dose of 0.3 g kg- 1 body mass of NaHCO3 90 min before the exercise in which energy is supplied by the glycolytic system.
33546705/Anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects elicited by short chain fatty acids produced by Escherichia coli isolated from healthy human gut microbiota Background Extracellular metabolites of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted by gut microbiota have been reported to play an important role in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis. Apart from supplying energy, SCFA also elicit immune stimulation in animal and human cells. Therefore, an attempt was conducted to isolate SCFA producing bacteria from healthy human microbiota. The anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects of extracellular metabolites and individual SFCA were further investigated by using breast, colon cancer and macrophage cells. Toxin, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expressions were investigated by RT-qPCR analyses in this study. Results Escherichia coli KUB-36 was selected in this study since it has the capability to produce seven SCFA extracellularly. It produced acetic acid as the main SCFA. It is a non-exotoxin producer and hence, it is a safe gut microbiota. The IC50 values indicated that the E. coli KUB-36 metabolites treatment elicited more potent cytotoxicity effect on MCF7 breast cancer cell as compared to colon cancer and leukemia cancer cells but exhibited little cytotoxic effects on normal breast cell. Furthermore, E. coli KUB-36 metabolites and individual SCFA could affect inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide-induced THP-1 macrophage cells since they suppressed inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha well as compared to the control, whilst inducing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 expression. Conclusion SCFA producing E. coli KUB-36 possessed vast potential as a beneficial gut microbe since it is a non-exotoxin producer that exhibited beneficial cytotoxic effects on cancer cells and elicited anti-inflammatory activity simultaneously. However, the probiotic characteristic of E. coli KUB-36 should be further elucidated using in vivo animal models.
33541369/Highly stable organic photothermal agent based on near-infrared-II fluorophores for tumor treatment Background The aim to develop a highly stable near-infrared (NIR) photoinduced tumor therapy agent stems from its considerable potential for biological application. Due to its long wavelength, biological imaging exhibits a high signal-to-background ratio, deep tissue penetration and maximum permissible light power, which can minimize damage to an organism during photoinduced tumor therapy. Results A class of stable NIR-II fluorophores (NIR998, NIR1028, NIR980, NIR1030, and NIR1028-S) based on aza-boron-dipyrromethene (aza-BODIPY) dyes with donor-acceptor-donor structures have been rationally designed and synthesized by harnessing the steric relaxation effect and intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (IPET). These fluorophores exhibit an intense range of NIR-II emission, large Stokes shift (>= 100 nm), excellent photothermal conversion performance, and superior stability against photobleaching. Among the NIR-II fluorophores, NIR998 possesses better NIR-II emission and photothermal conversion performance. NIR998 nanoparticles (NIR998 NPs) can be encapsulated by liposomes. NIR998 NPs show superior stability in the presence of light, heat, and reactive oxygen nitrogen species than that of indocyanine green NPs, as well as a higher photothermal conversion ability (eta = 50.5%) compared to other photothermal agents. Finally, under the guidance of photothermal imaging, NIR998 NPs have been proven to effectively eliminate tumors via their excellent photothermal conversion performance while presenting negligible cytotoxicity. Conclusions Utilizing IPET and the steric relaxation effect can effectively induce NIR-II emission of aza-BODIPY dyes. Stable NIR998 NPs have excellent photothermal conversion performance and negligible dark cytotoxicity, so they have the potential to act as photothermal agents in biological applications.
33498249/Bioprospecting of Coralline Red Alga Amphiroa rigida J.V. Lamouroux: Volatiles, Fatty Acids and Pigments Due to the lack of phytochemical composition data, the major goals of the present study on Amphiroa rigida J.V. Lamouroux were to: (a) investigate and compare volatilome profiles of fresh and air-dried samples obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and hydrodistillation (HD) followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis; (b) determine fatty acids profile by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID); (c) obtain the pigment profiles of semipurified extracts by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and (d) evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of its less polar fractions. The comparison of headspace of fresh (FrAr) and air-dried (DrAr) samples revealed many similarities regarding the presence and abundance of the major (heptadecane and pentadecane) and minor compounds. The hydrodistillate (HD) of DrAr profile was quite different in comparison to HD-FrAr. The predominant compound in HD-FrAr was (E)-phytol. In HD-DrAr, its percentage was approximately one-half reduced, but the abundance of its degradation product phytone and of unsaturated and oxygenated compounds increased indicating more intense fatty acid decomposition and oxidation during drying. The fatty acid determination revealed that the most dominant was palmitic acid (42.86%) followed by eicosapentaenoic acid (19.14%) and stearic acid (11.65%). Among the pigments, A. rigida contained fucoxanthin (0.63 mg g-1 of dry fraction), lutein (5.83 mg g-1), beta-carotene (6.18 mg g-1) and chlorophyll a (13.65 mg g-1). The analyzed less polar fractions of A. rigida exhibited antioxidant scavenging activity with diammonium salt of 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-yl) sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay up to 3.87 mg g-1 trolox equivalents (TE), and with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay up to 825.63 mumol g-1 TE (with carotenoids as the major contributors).
33498239/Inclusion Compound of Efavirenz and gamma-Cyclodextrin: Solid State Studies and Effect on Solubility Efavirenz is an antiretroviral drug of widespread use in the management of infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Efavirenz is also used in paediatrics, but due to its very poor aqueous solubility the liquid formulations available resort to oil-based excipients. In this report we describe the interaction of gamma-cyclodextrin with efavirenz in solution and in the solid state. In aqueous solution, the preferential host-guest stoichiometry was determined by the continuous variation method using 1H NMR, which indicated a 3:2 host-to-guest proportion. Following, the solid inclusion compound was prepared at different stoichiometries by co-dissolution and freeze-drying. Solid-state characterisation of the products using FT-IR, 13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR, thermogravimetry, and X-ray powder diffraction has confirmed that the 3:2 stoichiometry is the adequate starting condition to isolate a solid inclusion compound in the pure form. The effect of gamma-cyclodextrin on the solubility of efavirenz is studied by the isotherm method.
33498320/Effect of the Supporting Electrolyte on Chloroform Reduction at a Silver Electrode in Aqueous Solutions Herein, we report, for the first time, a comparative study on the electrocatalytic reduction of chloroform on silver in different aqueous supporting electrolytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed at a wide range of scan rates and concentrations of CHCl3 using 0.05 M NaClO4, NaH2PO4, and Na2HPO4 as supporting electrolytes. We observed that a type of supporting electrolyte anion strongly influences both the potential as well as the current density of the chloroform reduction peak, mainly due to the presence of OH- in an alkaline Na2HPO4 solution, which is a specifically interacting anion. Moreover, the highest sensitivity of the Ag electrode toward CHCl3 reduction was observed in a neutral NaClO4 aqueous solution. It was found that the electroreduction of chloroform at the silver surface occurs via a concerted mechanism regardless of the type of the studied supporting electrolyte.
33498348/Actuating Shape Memory Polymer for Thermoresponsive Soft Robotic Gripper and Programmable Materials For soft robotics and programmable metamaterials, novel approaches are required enabling the design of highly integrated thermoresponsive actuating systems. In the concept presented here, the necessary functional component was obtained by polymer syntheses. First, poly(1,10-decylene adipate) diol (PDA) with a number average molecular weight Mn of 3290 g mol-1 was synthesized from 1,10-decanediol and adipic acid. Afterward, the PDA was brought to reaction with 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 1,4-butanediol. The resulting polyester urethane (PEU) was processed to the filament, and samples were additively manufactured by fused-filament fabrication. After thermomechanical treatment, the PEU reliably actuated under stress-free conditions by expanding on cooling and shrinking on heating with a maximum thermoreversible strain of 16.1%. Actuation stabilized at 12.2%, as verified in a measurement comprising 100 heating-cooling cycles. By adding an actuator element to a gripper system, a hen's egg could be picked up, safely transported and deposited. Finally, one actuator element each was built into two types of unit cells for programmable materials, thus enabling the design of temperature-dependent behavior. The approaches are expected to open up new opportunities, e.g., in the fields of soft robotics and shape morphing.
33498440/Crocins, the Bioactive Components of Crocus sativus L., Counteract the Disrupting Effects of Anesthetic Ketamine on Memory in Rats Consistent experimental evidence suggests that anesthetic doses of the non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine cause severe memory impairments in rodents. Crocins are among the various bioactive ingredients of the plant Crocus sativus L., and their implication in memory is well-documented. It has not yet been elucidated if crocins are able to attenuate the memory deficits produced by anesthetic ketamine. The present study was undertaken aiming to clarify this issue in the rat. For this aim, the object recognition, the object location and the habituation tests, reflecting non-spatial recognition memory, spatial recognition memory and associative memory, respectively, were utilized. A post-training challenge with crocins (15-30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.), acutely) counteracted anesthetic ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced performance impairments in all the above-mentioned behavioral memory paradigms. The current findings suggest that crocins modulate anesthetic ketamine's amnestic effects.
33498484/Spin Exchanges between Transition Metal Ions Governed by the Ligand p-Orbitals in Their Magnetic Orbitals In this review on spin exchanges, written to provide guidelines useful for finding the spin lattice relevant for any given magnetic solid, we discuss how the values of spin exchanges in transition metal magnetic compounds are quantitatively determined from electronic structure calculations, which electronic factors control whether a spin exchange is antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, and how these factors are related to the geometrical parameters of the spin exchange path. In an extended solid containing transition metal magnetic ions, each metal ion M is surrounded with main-group ligands L to form an MLn polyhedron (typically, n = 3-6), and the unpaired spins of M are represented by the singly-occupied d-states (i.e., the magnetic orbitals) of MLn. Each magnetic orbital has the metal d-orbital combined out-of-phase with the ligand p-orbitals; therefore, the spin exchanges between adjacent metal ions M lead not only to the M-L-M-type exchanges, but also to the M-L...L-M-type exchanges in which the two metal ions do not share a common ligand. The latter can be further modified by d0 cations A such as V5+ and W6+ to bridge the L...L contact generating M-L...A...L-M-type exchanges. We describe several qualitative rules for predicting whether the M-L...L-M and M-L...A...L-M-type exchanges are antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic by analyzing how the ligand p-orbitals in their magnetic orbitals (the ligand p-orbital tails, for short) are arranged in the exchange paths. Finally, we illustrate how these rules work by analyzing the crystal structures and magnetic properties of four cuprates of current interest: alpha-CuV2O6, LiCuVO4, (CuCl)LaNb2O7, and Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2.
33498526/Microwave-Assisted Synthesis, Structural Characterization and Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Some New Aminopyridine, Pyrrolidine, Piperidine and Morpholine Acetamides A series of new acetamide derivatives 22-28 of primary and secondary amines and para-toluene sulphinate sodium salt have been synthesized under microwave irradiation and assessed in vitro for their antibacterial activity against one Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacterial species such as S. pyogenes, E. coli, and P. mirabilis using the Mueller-Hinton Agar diffusion (well diffusion) method. The synthesized compounds with significant differences in inhibition diameters and MICs were compared with those of amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, azithromycin and doxycycline. All of the evaluated acetamide derivatives were used with varying inhibition concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 37.5, 62.5, 87.5, 112.5 and 125 microg/mL. The results show that the most important antibacterial properties were displayed by the synthetic compounds 22 and 24, both of bear a para-chlorophenyl moiety incorporated into the 2-position moiety of acetamide 1. The molecular structures of the new compounds were determined using the FT-IR and 1H-NMR techniques.
33494185/GPR119 and GPR55 as Receptors for Fatty Acid Ethanolamides, Oleoylethanolamide and Palmitoylethanolamide Oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide are members of the fatty acid ethanolamide family, also known as acylethanolamides. Their physiological effects, including glucose homeostasis, anti-inflammation, anti-anaphylactic, analgesia, and hypophagia, have been reported. They have affinity for different receptor proteins, including nuclear receptors such as PPARalpha, channels such as TRPV1, and membrane receptors such as GPR119 and GPR55. In the present review, the pathophysiological functions of fatty acid ethanolamides have been discussed from the perspective of receptor pharmacology and drug discovery.
33498575/Synthesis of Chiral Helic[1]triptycene[3]arenes and Their Enantioselective Recognition towards Chiral Guests Containing Aminoindan Groups Starting from the enantiopure precursors, a pair of chiral macrocyclic arenes named helic[1]triptycene[3]arenes were conveniently synthesized. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the enantiomeric macrocyclic arenes exhibited mirror images, and the X-ray single crystal structures confirmed their absolute conformations as well. Moreover, the macrocyclic arenes showed strong complexation with secondary ammonium and primary ammonium salts containing aminoindan groups. In particular, the chiral macrocyclic arenes exhibited enantioselective recognition ability towards the chiral secondary ammonium salts containing aminoindan groups with an enantioselective ratio up to 3.89.
33494154/Aldose Reductase and the Polyol Pathway in Schwann Cells: Old and New Problems Aldose reductase (AR) is a member of the reduced nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent aldo-keto reductase superfamily. It is also the rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway, catalyzing the conversion of glucose to sorbitol, which is subsequently converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. AR is highly expressed by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The excess glucose flux through AR of the polyol pathway under hyperglycemic conditions has been suggested to play a critical role in the development and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Despite the intensive basic and clinical studies over the past four decades, the significance of AR over-activation as the pathogenic mechanism of DPN remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the expected efficacy of some AR inhibitors in patients with DPN has been unsatisfactory, which prompted us to further investigate and review the understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of AR in the PNS. Particularly, the investigation of AR and the polyol pathway using immortalized Schwann cells established from normal and AR-deficient mice could shed light on the causal relationship between the metabolic abnormalities of Schwann cells and discordance of axon-Schwann cell interplay in DPN, and led to the development of better therapeutic strategies against DPN.
33494150/Conserved Structural Features of Core Oligosaccharides among the Lipopolysaccharides of Respiratory Pathogens from the Genus Bordetella Analyzed Exclusively by NMR Spectroscopy Bacterial pathogens expose on the cell surface a variety of complex carbohydrate molecules. Gram-negative bacteria produce lipopolysaccharides, which are the main components of the outer membrane of bacterial envelopes and play a major role in host-pathogen interactions. B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii, are mammalian respiratory pathogens, having substantial economic impact on human health and agriculture. B. pertussis is responsible for whooping cough (pertussis) and B. holmesii is the second pertussis etiological factor, but the current anti-pertussis vaccines do not provide cross-protection. The structural data on any given hypothetical carbohydrate antigen is a prerequisite for further analysis of structure-related activities and their interaction with hosts. 1H NMR spectra constitute fingerprints of the analyzed glycans and provide unique identity information. The concept of structure-reporter groups has now been augmented by 1H,13C-correlation spectra of the Bordetella oligosaccharides. The comparative analysis of Bordetellae oligosaccharides (OS) revealed that the hexasaccharide, comprising the alpha-GlcpN, alpha-GlcpA, 4,6-disubstituted-beta-Glcp, 2,7-disubstituted-l-alpha-d-Hepp, 3,4-disubstituted-l-alpha-d-Hepp, and Kdo, constitute the least variable OS segment. This minimal common element in the structure of lipopolysaccharides of Bordetellae could be used to devise a universal cross-protective vaccine component against infections with various bacteria from the genus Bordetella.
33494216/Pourbaix-Guided Mineralization and Site-Selective Photoluminescence Properties of Rare Earth Substituted B-Type Carbonated Hydroxyapatite Nanocrystals Rare-earth labeling in biological apatite could provide critical information for the pathologic transition (osteoclastic) and physiologic regeneration (osteogenesis) of bone and teeth because of their characteristic site-sensitive fluorescence in different coordinative conditions of various tissues in many biological processes. However, the rare-earth labeling method for biological apatites, i.e., carbonated-hydroxyapatite, has been rarely found in the literature. In this paper, we report a Pourbaix-diagram guided mineralizing strategy to controllable carbonation and doping of rare-earth ions in the hydroxyapatite (HA) lattice. The carbonation process of hydroxyapatite was achieved by controllable mineralization in hydrothermal condition with K2CO3 as the carbonate source, which results into the pure B-type carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) with tunable carbonate substitution degree. All of the as-synthesized materials crystalized into P63/m (No. 176) space group with the lattice parameter of a decreases and c increases with the increasing of carbonate content in the reactants. Structural refinement results revealed that the substitution of planar CO32- is superimposed on one of the faces of PO43- tetrahedral sub-units with a rotation angle of 30  in reference to c-axis. All of the hydrothermally synthesized CHA nanocrystals show hexagonal rod-like morphology with the length of 70-110 nm and diameter of 21-35 nm, and the decreasing length/diameter ratio from 3.61 to 2.96 from low to high carbonated level of the samples. Five rare-earth cations, of Pr3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, and Ho3+, were used as possible probe ions that can be doped into either HA or CHA lattice. The site-preference of Tb3+ doping is the same in the crystallographic site of HA and CHA according to characteristic emission peaks of 5D4-7Fj (j = 3-6) transitions in their photoluminescent spectroscopy. Our work provides a controllable carbonation method for rare-earth labeling hydroxyapatite nanomaterials with potential biologically active implant powders for bone repair and tissue regeneration.
33494198/Identification and Quantification of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Polyhydroxyalkanoates Produced from Mixed Microbial Cultures and Municipal Organic Wastes at Pilot Scale Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are well-known biodegradable plastics produced by various bacterial strains, whose major drawback is constituted by the high cost of their synthesis. Producing PHAs from mixed microbial cultures and employing organic wastes as a carbon source allows us to both reduce cost and valorize available renewable resources, such as food waste and sewage sludge. However, different types of pollutants, originally contained in organic matrices, could persist into the final product, thus compromising their safety. In this work, the exploitation of municipal wastes for PHA production is evaluated from the environmental and health safety aspect by determining the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in both commercial and waste-based PHA samples. Quantification of PAHs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on 24 PHA samples obtained in different conditions showed very low contamination levels, in the range of ppb to a few ppm. Moreover, the contaminant content seems to be dependent on the type of PHA stabilization and extraction, but independent from the type of feedstock. Commercial PHA derived from crops, selected for comparison, showed PAH content comparable to that detected in PHAs derived from organic fraction of municipal solid waste. Although there is no specific regulation on PAH maximum levels in PHAs, detected concentrations were consistently lower than threshold limit values set by regulation and guidelines for similar materials and/or applications. This suggests that the use of organic waste as substrate for PHA production is safe for both the human health and the environment.
33494212/Dynamic Changes in Glutenin Macropolymer during Different Dough Mixing and Resting Processes The glutenin macropolymer (GMP), which is an important component of the glutenin protein in wheat flour, plays a prominent role in governing dough properties and breadmaking quality. This study investigated the changes in GMP properties during the mixing and resting stages of dough processing. The results show that the GMP content decreases by about 20.20% when the mixing time increases from 3 to 5 min, while increasing the resting time can lead to restoration of some GMP contents. Resting promotes greater formation of large-sized GMP particles, which is likely related to the increased disulfide bond content in the GMP during this process. In contrast, the mechanical force of mixing causes GMP depolymerization and formation of smaller particles. Furthermore, after mixing, the protein secondary structure tends to be disordered, the protein morphology becomes irregular, and the protein subunit ratio changes. Thus, mixing has many of the opposite effects to resting, although resting can (to some extent) restore the properties of the GMP after mixing. However, excessive resting time can lead to negative results, reflected in lower disulfide bond (SS) and GMP contents, and more irregular particle sizes. The presented results suggest that dough mixing induces rearrangement of the dough's protein structure, and resting somewhat restores the chemical bonds and internal protein structure.
33494201/Hydrolysis of Element (White) Phosphorus under the Action of Heterometallic Cubane-Type Cluster {Mo3PdS4} Reaction of heterometallic cubane-type cluster complexes:[Mo3{Pd(dba)}S4Cl3(dbbpy)3]PF6, [Mo3{Pd(tu)}S4Cl3(dbbpy)3]Cl and [Mo3{Pd(dba)}S4(acac)3(py)3]PF6, where dba:dibenzylideneacetone, dbbpy:4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, tu:thiourea, acac:acetylacetonate, py:pyridine, with white phosphorus (P4) in the presence of water leads to the formation of phosphorous acid H3PO3 as the major product. The crucial role of the Pd atom in the cluster core {Mo3PdS4} has been established in the hydrolytic activation of P4 molecule. The main intermediate of the process, the cluster complex [Mo3{PdP(OH)3}S4Cl3(dbbpy)3]+ with coordinated P(OH)3 molecule and phosphine PH3, have been detected by 31P NMR spectroscopy in the reaction mixture.
33530389/Pulmonaria obscura and Pulmonaria officinalis Extracts as Mitigators of Peroxynitrite-Induced Oxidative Stress and Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors-In Vitro and In Silico Studies The Pulmonaria species (lungwort) are edible plants and traditional remedies for different disorders of the respiratory system. Our work covers a comparative study on biological actions in human blood plasma and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) -inhibitory properties of plant extracts (i.e., phenolic-rich fractions) originated from aerial parts of P. obscura Dumort. and P. officinalis L. Phytochemical profiling demonstrated the abundance of phenolic acids and their derivatives (over 80% of the isolated fractions). Danshensu conjugates with caffeic acid, i.e., rosmarinic, lithospermic, salvianolic, monardic, shimobashiric and yunnaneic acids were identified as predominant components. The examined extracts (1-100 microg/mL) partly prevented harmful effects of the peroxynitrite-induced oxidative stress in blood plasma (decreased oxidative damage to blood plasma components and improved its non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity). The cellular safety of the extracts was confirmed in experimental models of blood platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. COX-2 inhibitor screening evidently suggested a stronger activity of P. officinalis (IC50 of 13.28 and 7.24 microg/mL, in reaction with synthetic chromogen and physiological substrate (arachidonic acid), respectively). In silico studies on interactions of main components of the Pulmonaria extracts with the COX-2 demonstrated the abilities of ten compounds to bind with the enzyme, including rosmarinic acid, menisdaurin, globoidnan A and salvianolic acid H.
33494451/Heme Binding to HupZ with a C-Terminal Tag from Group A Streptococcus HupZ is an expected heme degrading enzyme in the heme acquisition and utilization pathway in Group A Streptococcus. The isolated HupZ protein containing a C-terminal V5-His6 tag exhibits a weak heme degradation activity. Here, we revisited and characterized the HupZ-V5-His6 protein via biochemical, mutagenesis, protein quaternary structure, UV-vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. The results show that the ferric heme-protein complex did not display an expected ferric EPR signal and that heme binding to HupZ triggered the formation of higher oligomeric states. We found that heme binding to HupZ was an O2-dependent process. The single histidine residue in the HupZ sequence, His111, did not bind to the ferric heme, nor was it involved with the weak heme-degradation activity. Our results do not favor the heme oxygenase assignment because of the slow binding of heme and the newly discovered association of the weak heme degradation activity with the His6-tag. Altogether, the data suggest that the protein binds heme by its His6-tag, resulting in a heme-induced higher-order oligomeric structure and heme stacking. This work emphasizes the importance of considering exogenous tags when interpreting experimental observations during the study of heme utilization proteins.
33514028/Chemical Constituents of the Bulbs of Scilla peruviana and Their Pancreatic Lipase Inhibitory Activity Scilla species are used as medicinal plants and contain lanosterol-type triterpene glycosides. The phytochemical investigation of the bulbs of Scilla peruviana led to the isolation of 17 compounds, including three new rearranged pentacyclic-lanosterol glycosides (1-3) and two new homoisoflavanone glycosides (12 and 13). The structures of the undescribed compounds were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including two-dimensional (2D) NMR. Among the triterpene glycosides, 2, 3, and 6 showed significant pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The oral administration of scillascilloside D-2 (6) reduced serum triglyceride levels in a dose-dependent manner in soybean oil-loaded mice.
33530633/New Photochromic alpha-Methylchalcones Are Highly Photostable, Even under Singlet Oxygen Conditions: Breaking the alpha-Methyl Michael-System Reactivity by Reversible Peroxybiradical Formation The alpha-methylated chalcones 7a-7e behave as P-type photochromic substances with photo-stationary states (PSS) as high as 15:85 when irradiated at 350 nm. These compounds are easily accessible in pure E-configuration by aldol condensation or by oxidative coupling/elimination. The alpha-methyl groups make these compounds potentially reactive with singlet oxygen following the gem-rule that predicts 1O2 regioselectivity. Even after long irradiations times in the presence of the singlet oxygen sensitizer tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and oxygen, however, no oxygenation products were detected. Under these conditions, all substrates were converted into 9:1 E/Z-mixtures despite the use of low-energy light that does not allow direct or sensitized excitation of the substrates 7. Additionally, chalcone 7a reduced the singlet oxygen reactivity of the tiglic ketone 3a by about a factor of two, indicating substantial physical quenching of singlet oxygen by the alpha-methylated chalcones 7a-7e. Thus, a singlet oxygen-induced E/Z-isomerization involving 1,2-dioxatetra-methylene biradicals that leads to triplet oxygen and thermodynamic E/Z-mixtures is postulated and supported by quantum chemical (DFT)-calculations.
33530597/Caralluma europaea (Guss.) N.E.Br.: Anti-Inflammatory, Antifungal, and Antibacterial Activities against Nosocomial Antibiotic-Resistant Microbes of Chemically Characterized Fractions Caralluma europaea (Guss.) N.E.Br.: (C. europaea) is a wild medicinal plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is commonly used in traditional medicines for treating several diseases. The present work aims to evaluate the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal potentials of C. europaea fractions including hydro ethanol (ET CE), n-butanol (But CE), and polyphenol (Poly CE). The chemical composition of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions from C. europaea were determined using GC-MS after silylation. The anti-inflammatory effect of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions was studied by carrageenan-induced paw edema. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts were assessed using the disc diffusion and micro-dilution assays. The findings of the chemical characterization affirmed the presence of interesting bioactive compounds in C. europaea fractions. The polyphenol-rich fraction was the best inhibitor of edema by75.68% after 6 h of treatment. The hydroethanol fraction was the most active against both bacteria and yeasts. This study contributes to society as it provides potential bioactive compounds in C. europaea extract, which may help in fighting nosocomial antibiotic-resistant microbes.
33494384/Human Intravenous Immunoglobulin Alleviates Neuropathic Symptoms in a Rat Model of Paclitaxel-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity The onset of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a leading cause of the dose reduction or discontinuation of cancer treatment due to sensory symptoms. Paclitaxel (PTX) can cause painful peripheral neuropathy, with a negative impact on cancer survivors' quality of life. While recent studies have shown that neuroinflammation is involved in PTX-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (PIPN), the pathophysiology of this disabling side effect remains largely unclear and no effective therapies are available. Therefore, here we investigated the effects of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on a PIPN rat model. PTX-treated rats showed mechanical allodynia and neurophysiological alterations consistent with a severe sensory axonal polyneuropathy. In addition, morphological evaluation showed a reduction of intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density and evidenced axonopathy with macrophage infiltration, which was more prominent in the distal segment of caudal nerves. Three weeks after the last PTX injection, mechanical allodynia was still present in PTX-treated rats, while the full recovery in the group of animals co-treated with IVIg was observed. At the pathological level, this behavioral result was paralleled by prevention of the reduction in IENF density induced by PTX in IVIg co-treated rats. These results suggest that the immunomodulating effect of IVIg co-treatment can alleviate PIPN neurotoxic manifestations, probably through a partial reduction of neuroinflammation.
33525453/Neurochemical Effects of 4-(2Chloro-4-Fluorobenzyl)-3-(2-Thienyl)-1,2,4-Oxadiazol-5(4H)-One in the Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-Induced Epileptic Seizure Zebrafish Model Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, and it is characterized by spontaneous seizures. In a previous study, we identified 4-(2-chloro-4-fluorobenzyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one (GM-90432) as a novel anti-epileptic agent in chemically- or genetically-induced epileptic zebrafish and mouse models. In this study, we investigated the anti-epileptic effects of GM-90432 through neurochemical profiling-based approach to understand the neuroprotective mechanism in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epileptic seizure zebrafish model. GM-90432 effectively improved PTZ-induced epileptic behaviors via upregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, 17-beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, 5alpha -dihydroprogesterone, and allopregnanolone levels, and downregulation of normetanephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and cortisol levels in brain tissue. GM-90432 also had a protective effect against PTZ-induced oxidative stress and zebrafish death, suggesting that it exhibits biphasic neuroprotective effects via scavenging of reactive oxygen species and anti-epileptic activities in a zebrafish model. In conclusion, our results suggest that neurochemical profiling study could be used to better understand of anti-epileptic mechanism of GM-90432, potentially leading to new drug discovery and development of anti-seizure agents.
33494541/Catechol-Based Antimicrobial Polymers Catechol is a key constituent in mussel adhesive proteins and is responsible for strong adhesive property and crosslinking formation. Plant-based polyphenols are also capable of chemical interactions similar to those of catechol and are inherently antimicrobial. This review reports a series of catechol-based antimicrobial polymers classified according to their antimicrobial mechanisms. Catechol is utilized as a surface anchoring group for adhering monomers and polymers of known antimicrobial properties onto various types of surfaces. Additionally, catechol's ability to form strong complexes with metal ions and nanoparticles was utilized to sequester these antimicrobial agents into coatings and polymer matrices. During catechol oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated as a byproduct, and the use of the generated ROS for antimicrobial applications was also introduced. Finally, polymers that utilized the innate antimicrobial property of halogenated catechols and polyphenols were reviewed.
33525549/Auxin-Induced SaARF4 Downregulates SaACO4 to Inhibit Lateral Root Formation in Sedum alfredii Hance Lateral root (LR) formation promotes plant resistance, whereas high-level ethylene induced by abiotic stress will inhibit LR emergence. Considering that local auxin accumulation is a precondition for LR generation, auxin-induced genes inhibiting ethylene synthesis may thus be important for LR development. Here, we found that auxin response factor 4 (SaARF4) in Sedum alfredii Hance could be induced by auxin. The overexpression of SaARF4 decreased the LR number and reduced the vessel diameters. Meanwhile, the auxin distribution mode was altered in the root tips and PIN expression was also decreased in the overexpressed lines compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. The overexpression of SaARF4 could reduce ethylene synthesis, and thus, the repression of ethylene production decreased the LR number of WT and reduced PIN expression in the roots. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, yeast one-hybrid, and dual-luciferase assay results showed that SaARF4 could bind the promoter of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 4 (SaACO4), associated with ethylene biosynthesis, and could downregulate its expression. Therefore, we concluded that SaARF4 induced by auxin can inhibit ethylene biosynthesis by repressing SaACO4 expression, and this process may affect auxin transport to delay LR development.
33498762/Cell-Penetrating Doxorubicin Released from Elastin-Like Polypeptide Kills Doxorubicin-Resistant Cancer Cells in In Vitro Study Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) undergo a characteristic phase transition in response to ambient temperature. Therefore, it has been be used as a thermosensitive vector for the delivery of chemotherapy agents since it can be used to target hyperthermic tumors. This novel strategy introduces unprecedented options for treating cancer with fewer concerns about side effects. In this study, the ELP system was further modified with an enzyme-cleavable linker in order to release drugs within tumors. This system consists of an ELP, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) substrate, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and a 6-maleimidocaproyl amide derivative of doxorubicin (Dox). This strategy shows up to a 4-fold increase in cell penetration and results in more death in breast cancer cells compared to ELP-Dox. Even in doxorubicin-resistant cells (NCI/ADR and MES-SA/Dx5), ELP-released cell-penetrating doxorubicin demonstrated better membrane penetration, leading to at least twice the killing of resistant cells compared to ELP-Dox and free Dox. MMP-digested CPP-Dox showed better membrane penetration and induced more cancer cell death in vitro. This CPP-complexed Dox released from the ELP killed even Dox-resistant cells more efficiently than both free doxorubicin and non-cleaved ELP-CPP-Dox.
33494340/Synergism and Subadditivity of Verbascoside-Lignans and -Iridoids Binary Mixtures Isolated from Castilleja tenuiflora Benth. on NF-kappaB/AP-1 Inhibition Activity Pharmacodynamic interactions between plant isolated compounds are important to understand the mode of action of an herbal extract to formulate or create better standardized extracts, phytomedicines, or phytopharmaceuticals. In this work, we propose binary mixtures using a leader compound to found pharmacodynamic interactions in inhibition of the NF-kappaB/AP-1 pathway using RAW-Blue  cells. Eight compounds were isolated from Castilleja tenuiflora, four were new furofuran-type lignans for the species magnolin, eudesmin, sesamin, and kobusin. Magnolin (60.97%) was the most effective lignan inhibiting the NF-kappaB/AP-1 pathway, followed by eudesmin (56.82%), tenuifloroside (52.91%), sesamin (52.63%), and kobusin (45.45%). Verbascoside, a major compound contained in wild C. tenuiflora showed an inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB/AP-1. This polyphenol was chosen as a leader compound for binary mixtures. Verbacoside-aucubin and verbascoside-kobusin produced synergism, while verbascoside-tenuifloroside had subadditivity in all concentrations. Verbascoside-kobusin is a promising mixture to use on NF-kappaB/AP-1 related diseases and anti-inflammatory C. tenuiflora-based phytomedicines.
33525644/Effect of O-Antigen Chain Length Regulation on the Immunogenicity of Shigella and Salmonella Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) Recently, generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) technology has been proposed as an alternative approach to traditional glycoconjugate vaccines for O-antigen delivery. Saccharide length is a well-known parameter that can impact the immune response induced by glycoconjugates both in terms of magnitude and quality. However, the criticality of O-antigen length on the immune response induced by GMMA-based vaccines has not been fully elucidated. Here, Shigella and Salmonella GMMA-producing strains were further mutated in order to display homogeneous polysaccharide populations of different sizes on a GMMA surface. Resulting GMMA were compared in mice immunization studies. Athymic nude mice were also used to investigate the involvement of T-cells in the immune response elicited. In contrast with what has been reported for traditional glycoconjugate vaccines and independent of the pathogen and the sugar structural characteristics, O-antigen length did not result in being a critical parameter for GMMA immunogenicity. This work supports the identification of critical quality attributes to optimize GMMA vaccine design and improve vaccine efficacy and gives insights on the nature of the immune response induced by GMMA.
33525535/Consecutive Low Doses of Streptozotocin Induce Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Features in Mice Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women. Due to its various pathophysiological properties and clinical heterophenotypes, the mechanism of PCOS pathogenesis is still unclear. Several animal models have been used to study PCOS and allow the exploration of the specific mechanism underlying PCOS. We focused on streptozotocin (STZ) to develop a non-steroidal and non-diabetic PCOS model. We administered multiple STZ injections to female C57BL/6 mice (3-4 weeks old) at different concentrations: STZ-15 (15 mg/kg), STZ-30 (30 mg/kg), and STZ-60 (60 mg/kg) treatments. During the experimental period, we analyzed body weight, blood glucose levels, and estrous cycle pattern. Furthermore, five weeks after STZ administration, we examined hormone levels and the morphology of ovarian tissues. Mice in the STZ-15 group did not show differences in body weights, blood glucose level, insulin level, and insulin tolerance compared to wild-type and control groups whereas those in the STZ-60 group presented a typical diabetes phenotype. In the case of the STZ-30 group, only increased blood glucose level was observed. Total testosterone levels were significantly elevated in STZ-15 and STZ-30 groups. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol levels were not significantly changed in the STZ-treated groups. The number of ovarian antral follicles and atretic follicles significantly increased in the ovary of mice in the STZ-15 and STZ-30 groups. All STZ-treated groups manifested irregular estrus cycles. However, the patterns of estrous cycles were different between mice treated with different STZ concentrations. We found that PI3K-AKT and IRS-1 signaling in the ovary was enhanced by low doses of STZ treatment. Taken together, our finding indicates that multiple injections of STZ at low doses induce PCOS features in mice without induction of diabetes features.
33513992/Hyaluronic Acid-Targeted Stimuli-Sensitive Nanomicelles Co-Encapsulating Paclitaxel and Ritonavir to Overcome Multi-Drug Resistance in Metastatic Breast Cancer and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Active targeting and overcoming multi-drug resistance (MDR) can be some of the important attributes of targeted therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. In this study, we constructed a hyaluronic acid (HA)-decorated mixed nanomicelles-encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX) and P-glycoprotein inhibitor ritonavir (RTV). HA was conjugated to poly (lactide) co-(glycolide) (PLGA) polymer by disulfide bonds (HA-ss-PLGA). HA is a natural ligand for CD44 receptors overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Disulfide bonds undergo rapid reduction in the presence of glutathione, present in breast cancer cells. The addition of RTV can inhibit the P-gp and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of PTX, thus aiding in reversing MDR and sensitizing the cells toward PTX. An in vitro uptake and cytotoxicity study in MBC MCF-7 and TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell lines demonstrated the effective uptake of the nanomicelles and drug PTX compared to non-neoplastic breast epithelium MCF-12A cells. Interestingly, in vitro potency determination showed a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species in breast cancer cell lines, indicating effective apoptosis of cancer cells. Thus, stimuli-sensitive nanomicelles along with HA targeting and RTV addition can effectively serve as a chemotherapeutic drug delivery agent for MBC and TNBC.
33525659/ELOVL5 Participates in Embryonic Lipid Determination of Cellular Membranes and Cytoplasmic Droplets Embryonic lipids are crucial for the formation of cellular membranes and dynamically participate in metabolic pathways. Cells can synthesize simple fatty acids, and the elongation of fatty acids facilitates the formation of complex lipids. The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of the elongation of very long chain fatty acid enzyme 5 (ELOVL5) in embryonic development and lipid determination. Bovine embryos were produced in vitro using a standard protocol and randomly divided to receive one of three treatments at Day 4: morpholino (Mo) gene expression knockdown assay for ELOVL5 (ELOVL5-Mo), Mo antisense oligonucleotides for the thalassemic beta-globulin human mRNA (technical control Mo), and placebo (biological control). The phenotypes of embryonic development, cell number, ELOVL5 protein abundance, lipid droplet deposits, and lipid fingerprint were investigated. No detrimental effects (p > 0.05) were observed on embryo development in terms of cleavage (59.4 +- 3.5%, 63.6 +- 4.1%, and 65.4 +- 2.2%), blastocyst production (31.3 +- 4.2%, 28.1 +- 4.9%, and 36.1 +- 2.1%), and blastocyst cell number (99.6 +- 7.7, 100.2 +- 6.2, 86.8 +- 5.6), respectively, for biological control, technical control Mo, and ELOVL5-Mo. ELOVL5 protein abundance and cytoplasmic lipid droplet deposition were increased (p < 0.05) in ELOVL5-Mo-derived blastocysts compared with the controls. However, seven lipid species, including phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and triacylglycerol, were downregulated in the ELOVL5-Mo-derived blastocysts compared with the biological control. Therefore, ELOVL5 is involved in the determination of embryonic lipid content and composition. Transient translational blockage of ELOVL5 reduced the expression of specific lipid species and promoted increased cytoplasmic lipid droplet deposition, but with no apparent deleterious effect on embryonic development and blastocyst cell number.
33530626/Kahweol, a Diterpenoid Molecule, Inhibits CTGF-Dependent Synthetic Phenotype Switching and Migration in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype switching from contractile to synthetic is essential for proliferation and migration in vascular pathophysiology. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a matricellular protein involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Kahweol, a diterpene molecule in arabica coffee beans, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects in many cells. However, in VSMCs, the effects of kahweol on CTGF activities have not been investigated. Thus, in this study, the effects and associated mechanisms of kahweol in CTGF-dependent phenotype switching and migration in VSMCs were examined. Experiments were performed on primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells and a rat VSMC line, A7r5. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels. The mRNA levels of synthetic markers were measured by qRT-PCR. Migration of VSMCs was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Kahweol reduced the angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced CTGF expression. Further, kahweol inhibited expressions of synthetic phenotype markers of VSMC. The kahweol-reduced synthetic marker protein levels were reversed by the administration of rCTGF. However, expressions of contractile phenotype markers of VSMC were not affected. Kahweol suppressed Ang II-stimulated VSMC migration. Moreover, kahweol downregulated Ang II-induced p-FAK, p-Erk, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) protein expressions. Taken together, in Ang II-stimulated VSMCs, kahweol inhibited CTGF-dependent synthetic phenotype switching and migration, with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Erk, and YAP involved in the underlying mechanisms of the kahweol effects. These results suggest that kahweol has a potential as a therapeutic agent to inhibit CTGF, which is a molecular target in sclerogenic vascular disease.
33498614/CYP450 Mediates Reactive Oxygen Species Production in a Mouse Model of beta-Thalassemia through an Increase in 20-HETE Activity Oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the main contributors to cell injury and tissue damage in thalassemia patients. Recent studies suggest that ROS generation in non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) patients occurs as a result of iron overload. Among the different sources of ROS, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family of enzymes and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) have been proposed to be major contributors for oxidative stress in several diseases. However, the sources of ROS in patients with NTDT remain poorly understood. In this study, Hbbth3/+ mice, a mouse model for beta-thalassemia, were used. These mice exhibit an unchanged or decreased expression of the major NOX isoforms, NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4, when compared to their C57BL/6 control littermates. However, a significant increase in the protein synthesis of CYP4A and CYP4F was observed in the Hbbth3/+ mice when compared to the C57BL/6 control mice. These changes were paralleled by an increased production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a CYP4A and CYP4F metabolite. Furthermore, these changes corroborate with onset of ROS production concomitant with liver injury. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that CYP450 4A and 4F-induced 20-HETE production mediates reactive oxygen species overgeneration in Hbbth3/+ mice through an NADPH-dependent pathway.
33513853/Untargeted Metabolomics Unveil Changes in Autotrophic and Mixotrophic Galdieria sulphuraria Exposed to High-Light Intensity The thermoacidophilic red alga Galdieria sulphuraria has been optimizing a photosynthetic system for low-light conditions over billions of years, thriving in hot and acidic endolithic habitats. The growth of G. sulphuraria in the laboratory is very much dependent on light and substrate supply. Here, higher cell densities in G. sulphuraria under high-light conditions were obtained, although reductions in photosynthetic pigments were observed, which indicated this alga might be able to relieve the effects caused by photoinhibition. We further describe an extensive untargeted metabolomics study to reveal metabolic changes in autotrophic and mixotrophic G. sulphuraria grown under high and low light intensities. The up-modulation of bilayer lipids, that help generate better-ordered lipid domains (e.g., ergosterol) and keep optimal membrane thickness and fluidity, were observed under high-light exposure. Moreover, high-light conditions induced changes in amino acids, amines, and amide metabolism. Compared with the autotrophic algae, higher accumulations of osmoprotectant sugars and sugar alcohols were recorded in the mixotrophic G. sulphuraria. This response can be interpreted as a measure to cope with stress due to the high concentration of organic carbon sources. Our results indicate how G. sulphuraria can modulate its metabolome to maintain energetic balance and minimize harmful effects under changing environments.
33525606/Molecular Mechanism of Lipid Accumulation and Metabolism of Oleaginous Chlorococcum sphacosum GD from Soil under Salt Stress The oleaginous microalgae species Chlorococcum sphacosum GD is a promising feedstock for biodiesel production from soil. However, its metabolic mechanism of lipid production remains unclear. In this study, the lipid accumulation and metabolism mechanisms of Chlorococcum sphacosum GD were analyzed under salt stress based on transcriptome sequencing. The biomass and lipid content of the alga strain were determined under different NaCl concentrations, and total RNA from fresh cells were isolated and sequenced by HiSeq 2000 high throughput sequencing technology. As the salt concentration increased in culture medium, the algal lipid content increased but the biomass decreased. Following transcriptome sequencing by assembly and splicing, 24,128 unigenes were annotated, with read lengths mostly distributed in the 200-300 bp interval. Statistically significant differentially expressed unigenes were observed in different experimental groups, with 2051 up-regulated genes and 1835 down-regulated genes. The lipid metabolism pathway analysis showed that, under salt stress, gene-related fatty acid biosynthesis (ACCase, KASII, KAR, HAD, FATA) was significantly up-regulated, but some gene-related fatty acid degradation was significantly down-regulated. The comprehensive results showed that salt concentration can affect the lipid accumulation and metabolism of C. sphacosum GD, and the lipid accumulation is closely related to the fatty acid synthesis pathway.
33530612/Synthesis of Nitroaromatic Compounds via Three-Component Ring Transformations 1-Methyl-3,5-dinitro-2-pyridone serves as an excellent substrate for nucleophilic-type ring transformation because of the electron deficiency and presence of a good leaving group. In this review, we focus on the three-component ring transformation (TCRT) of dinitropyridone involving a ketone and a nitrogen source. When dinitropyridone is allowed to react with a ketone in the presence of ammonia, TCRT proceeds to afford nitropyridines that are not easily produced by alternative procedures. Ammonium acetate can be used as a nitrogen source instead of ammonia to undergo the TCRT, leading to nitroanilines in addition to nitropyridines. In these reactions, dinitropyridone serves as a safe synthetic equivalent of unstable nitromalonaldehyde.
33494373/Tryptophan Pathway Abnormalities in a Murine Model of Hereditary Glaucoma Background: It has been shown that a possible pathogenetic mechanism of neurodegeneration in the mouse model of glaucoma (DBA/2J) may be an alteration of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the retina. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that alterations of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism in DBA/2J mice is not limited to the retina. Methods: Samples of the retinal tissue and serum were collected from DBA/2J mice (6 and 10 months old) and control C57Bl/6 mice of the same age. The concentration of TRP, KYNA, kynurenine (KYN), and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OH-K) was measured by HPLC. The activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was also determined as a KYN/TRP ratio. Results: TRP, KYNA, L-KYN, and 3OH-K concentration were significantly lower in the retinas of DBA/2J mice than in C57Bl/6 mice. 3OH-K concentration was higher in older mice in both strains. Serum TRP, L-KYN, and KYNA concentrations were lower in DBA/2J than in age-matched controls. However, serum IDO activity did not differ significantly between compared groups and strains. Conclusions: Alterations of the TRP pathway seem not to be limited to the retina in the murine model of hereditary glaucoma.
33494330/Synthesis of Tetravalent Thio- and Selenogalactoside-Presenting Galactoclusters and Their Interactions with Bacterial Lectin PA-IL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Synthesis of tetravalent thio- and selenogalactopyranoside-containing glycoclusters using azide-alkyne click strategy is presented. Prepared compounds are potential ligands of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin PA-IL. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen associated with cystic fibrosis, and PA-IL is one of its virulence factors. The interactions of PA-IL and tetravalent glycoconjugates were investigated using hemagglutination inhibition assay and compared with mono- and divalent galactosides (propargyl 1-thio- and 1-seleno-beta-d-galactopyranoside, digalactosyl diselenide and digalactosyl disulfide). The lectin-carbohydrate interactions were also studied by saturation transfer difference NMR technique. Both thio- and seleno-tetravalent glycoconjugates were able to inhibit PA-IL significantly better than simple d-galactose or their intermediate compounds from the synthesis.
33525753/Zoledronate Causes a Systemic Shift of Macrophage Polarization towards M1 In Vivo Background: Immunomodulatory properties of bisphosphonates (BP) are suggested to contribute to the development of medication-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Furthermore, bisphosphonate-derived immune modulation might contribute to the anti-metastatic effect observed in breast cancer patients. Macrophages are potential candidates for the mediation of immunomodulatory effects of bisphosphonates. The study aimed to investigate the influence of bisphosphonates alone and in combination with surgical trauma on systemic macrophage polarization (M1 vs. M2) using an in vivo rat model. Methods: A total of 120 animals were divided into four groups. Groups 2 and 4 were treated with 8 x 40 mug/kg body weight of the BP Zoledronate i.p. (week 0-7). Groups 3 and 4 were exposed to surgical trauma (week 8, tooth extraction + tibia fracture), whereas in Group 1 neither medication nor surgical trauma was applied. After 8, 10, 12 and 16 weeks, skin, lung and spleen were immunohistochemically examined for macrophage polarization via expression analysis of CD68, CD163 and iNOS using a tissue microarray (TMA). Results: A significant shift of macrophage polarization towards M1 was observed in skin, spleen and lung tissue of animals, with and without surgical trauma, treated with BP when compared to those without BP application. Surgical trauma did not cause a significant increase towards M1 polarization. Conclusions: BP application leads to a systemic pro-inflammatory situation in vivo, independent of surgical trauma, as evidenced by the shift in macrophage polarization towards M1 in various somatic tissues. This provides a possible explanation for the clinically observed anti-tumor effect of bisphosphonates and might also contribute to pathogenesis of MRONJ.
33525499/New Highlights of Resveratrol: A Review of Properties against Ocular Diseases Eye diseases are currently a major public health concern due to the growing number of cases resulting from both an aging of populations and exogenous factors linked to our lifestyles. Thus, many treatments including surgical pharmacological approaches have emerged, and special attention has been paid to prevention, where diet plays a preponderant role. Recently, potential antioxidants such as resveratrol have received much attention as potential tools against various ocular diseases. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of resveratrol against ocular diseases, in particular age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and vitreoretinopathy. We analyze, in relation to the different steps of each disease, the resveratrol properties at multiple levels, such as cellular and molecular signaling as well as physiological effects. We show and discuss the relationship to reactive oxygen species, the regulation of inflammatory process, and how resveratrol can prevent ocular diseases through a potential epigenetic action by the activation of sirtuin-1. Lastly, various new forms of resveratrol delivery are emerging at the same time as some clinical trials are raising more questions about the future of resveratrol as a potential tool for prevention or in therapeutic strategies against ocular diseases. More preclinical studies are required to provide further insights into RSV's potential adjuvant activity.
33525417/The Role of GSH in Intracellular Iron Trafficking Evidence is reviewed for the role of glutathione in providing a ligand for the cytosolic iron pool. The possibility of histidine and carnosine forming ternary complexes with iron(II)glutathione is discussed and the physiological significance of these interactions considered. The role of carnosine in muscle, brain, and kidney physiology is far from established and evidence is presented that the iron(II)-binding capability of carnosine relates to this role.
33530645/Design and Synthesis of pi-Extended Resveratrol Analogues and In Vitro Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activity Evaluation The research on resveratrol (1) has been conducted intensively over a long time due to its proven antioxidant activity and disease-fighting capabilities. Many efforts have also been made to increase these biological effects. In the present study, six new extended aromatic resveratrol analogues containing naphthalene (2) and its bioisosteres quinoline (3 and 4), isoquinoline (5) quinoxaline (6) and quinazoline (7) scaffolds were designed and synthesized using an annulation strategy. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of these compounds were investigated. All compounds showed better antioxidant activity than resveratrol in ABTS assay. As for the anti-inflammatory test, 5 and 7 exhibited better activity than resveratrol. It is worth noting that nitrogen substitution on the extended aromatic resveratrol analogues has a significant impact on cell viability. Taking the antioxidant activities and NO inhibition activities into consideration, we conclude that isoquinoline analogue 5 may qualify for the further investigation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapy. Furthermore, our study results suggest that in order to improve the biological activity of polyphenolic compounds, extended aromaticity and nitrogen substitution strategy could be a viable method for the design of future drug candidates.
33513971/Effect of Pd Precursor Salts on the Chemical State, Particle Size, and Performance of Activated Carbon-Supported Pd Catalysts for the Selective Hydrogenation of Palm Biodiesel To improve the oxidative stability of biodiesel fuel (BDF), the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (poly-FAME) presented in commercial palm oil-derived biodiesel fuel (palm-BDF) were selectively hydrogenated to monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME) under a mild condition (80  C, 0.5 MPa) using activated carbon (AC)-supported Pd catalysts with a Pd loading of 1 wt.%. The partially hydrotreated palm-BDF (denoted as H-FAME) which has low poly-FAME components is a new type of BDF with enhanced quality for use in high blends. In this study, we reported that the chemical states and particle sizes of Pd in the prepared Pd/AC catalysts were significantly influenced by the Pd precursors, Pd(NO3)2 and Pd(NH3)4Cl2, and thus varied their hydrogenation activity and product selectivity. The 1%Pd/AC (nit) catalyst, prepared using Pd(NO3)2, presented high performance for selective hydrogenation of poly-FAME into mono-FAME with high oxidation stability, owning to its large Pd particles (8.4 nm). Conversely, the 1%Pd/AC (amc) catalyst, prepared using Pd(NH3)4Cl2, contained small Pd particles (2.7 nm) with a little Cl residues, which could be completely removed by washing with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NH4OH. The small Pd particles gave increased selectivity toward unwanted-FAME components, particularly the saturated fatty acid methyl esters during the hydrogenation of poly-FAME. This selectivity is unprofitable for improving the biodiesel quality.
33494463/Crystallographic and Computational Electron Density of dx2-y2 Orbitals of Azo-Schiff Base Metal Complexes Using Conventional Programs The crystal structures of two azobenzene derivative Schiff base metal complexes (new C44H40CuN6O2 of P-1 and known C44H38MnN6O7 of P21/c abbreviated as Cu and Mn, respectively) were (re-)determined experimentally using conventional X-ray analysis to obtain electron density using a PLATON program. Cu affords a four-coordinated square planar geometry, while Mn affords a hexa-coordinated distorted octahedral geometry whose apical sites are occupied by an acetate ion and water ligands, which are associated with hydrogen bonds. The pi-pi or CH-pi and hydrogen bonding intermolecular interactions were found in both crystals, which were also analyzed using a Hirshfeld surface analysis program. To compare these results with experimental results, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also carried out based on the crystal structures to obtain calculated electron density using a conventional Gaussian program. These results revealed that the axial Mn-O coordination bonds of Mn were relatively weaker than the in-plane M-N or M-O coordination bonds.
33494543/The Formation of Chitosan-Coated Rhamnolipid Liposomes Containing Curcumin: Stability and In Vitro Digestion There is growing interest in developing biomaterial-coated liposome delivery systems to improve the stability and bioavailability of curcumin, which is a hydrophobic nutraceutical claimed to have several health benefits. The curcumin-loaded rhamnolipid liposomes (Cur-RL-Lips) were fabricated from rhamnolipid and phospholipids, and then chitosan (CS) covered the surface of Cur-RL-Lips by electrostatic interaction to form CS-coated Cur-RL-Lips. The influence of CS concentration on the physical stability and digestion of the liposomes was investigated. The CS-coated Cur-RL-Lips with RL:CS = 1:1 have a relatively small size (412.9 nm) and positive charge (19.7 mV). The CS-coated Cur-RL-Lips remained stable from pH 2 to 5 at room temperature and can effectively slow the degradation of curcumin at 80  C; however, they were highly unstable to salt addition. In addition, compared with Cur-RL-Lips, the bioavailability of curcumin in CS-coated Cur-RL-Lips was relatively high due to its high transformation in gastrointestinal tract. These results may facilitate the design of a more efficacious liposomal delivery system that enhances the stability and bioavailability of curcumin in nutraceutical-loaded functional foods and beverages.
33525692/Anti-Inflammatory and Proliferative Properties of Luteolin-7-O-Glucoside Flavonoids display a broad range of structures and are responsible for the major organoleptic characteristics of plant-derived foods and beverages. Recent data showed their activity, and in particular of luteolin-7-O-glucoside (LUT-7G), in reduction of oxidative stress and inflammatory mechanisms in different physiological systems. In this paper, we tried to elucidate how LUT-7G could exert both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in endothelial cells cultured in vitro. Here, we showed that LUT-7G is able to inhibit the STAT3 pathway, to have an antiproliferative action, and an important antioxidant property in HUVEC cells. These properties are exerted by the flavone in endothelial through the transcriptional repression of a number of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors, and by the inhibition of ROS generation. ROS and STAT3 activation has been correlated with the production of oxysterols and other hydroxylated fatty acids, and they have been recognized important as players of atherogenesis and cardiocirculatory system diseases. The analysis of the general production pathway of these hydroxylated species, showed a strong decrease of cholesterol hydroxylated species such as 7-alpha-hydroxicholesterol, 7-beta-hydroxicholesterol by the treatment with LUT-7G. This confirms the anti-inflammatory properties of LUT-7G also in the endothelial district, showing for the first time the molecular pathway that verify previous postulated cardiovascular benefits of this flavone.
33494333/Magnesium Deficiency Induces Lipid Accumulation in Vascular Endothelial Cells via Oxidative Stress:The Potential Contribution of EDF-1 and PPARgamma Background: Magnesium deficiency contributes to atherogenesis partly by promoting the dysfunction of endothelial cells, which are critical in vascular homeostasis and diseases. Since EDF-1 and PPARgamma regulate crucial endothelial activities, we investigated the modulation of these proteins involved in lipogenesis as well the deposition of lipids in human endothelial cells cultured in different concentrations of magnesium. Methods: Human endothelial cells from the umbilical vein were cultured in medium containing from 0.1 to 5 mM magnesium for 24 h. The levels of EDF-1 and PPARgamma were visualized by Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by DCFDA. Lipids were detected after O Red Oil staining. Results: Magnesium deficiency leads to the accumulation of ROS which upregulate EDF-1. Further, PPARgamma is increased after culture in low magnesium, but independently from ROS. Moreover, lipids accumulate in magnesium-deficient cells. Conclusions: Our results suggest that magnesium deficiency leads to the deposition of lipids by inducing EDF-1 and PPARgamma. The increase in intracellular lipids might be interpreted as an adaptive response of endothelial cells to magnesium deficiency.
33494393/Amiodarone Enhances Anticonvulsive Effect of Oxcarbazepine and Pregabalin in the Mouse Maximal Electroshock Model Accumulating experimental studies show that antiarrhythmic and antiepileptic drugs share some molecular mechanisms of action and can interact with each other. In this study, the influence of amiodarone (a class III antiarrhythmic drug) on the antiseizure action of four second-generation antiepileptic drugs was evaluated in the maximal electroshock model in mice. Amiodarone, although ineffective in the electroconvulsive threshold test, significantly potentiated the antielectroshock activity of oxcarbazepine and pregabalin. Amiodarone, given alone or in combination with oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, or topiramate, significantly disturbed long-term memory in the passive-avoidance task in mice. Brain concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were not affected by amiodarone. However, the brain concentration of amiodarone was significantly elevated by oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and pregabalin. Additionally, oxcarbazepine and pregabalin elevated the brain concentration of desethylamiodarone, the main metabolite of amiodarone. In conclusion, potentially beneficial action of amiodarone in epilepsy patients seems to be limited by neurotoxic effects of amiodarone. Although results of this study should still be confirmed in chronic protocols of treatment, special precautions are recommended in clinical conditions. Coadministration of amiodarone, even at low therapeutic doses, with antiepileptic drugs should be carefully monitored to exclude undesired effects related to accumulation of the antiarrhythmic drug and its main metabolite, desethylamiodarone.
33494546/Content of Phenolic Acids in the Grain of Selected Polish Triticale Cultivars and Its Products The triticale grain has high nutritive value and good technological suitability. Triticale flour can be a valuable raw material for bread-making. The aim of this work was to determine the profile of phenolic acids in triticale grain of selected Polish cultivars and its products. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-PDA-MS/MS) was applied for separation and identification of these constituents. The grain of the examined triticale cultivars contained 13 phenolic acids, of which ferulic acid was determined in the largest amount and was constituted from 42-44% of the total content of phenolic acids in the grain. In addition, due to the large amounts of ferulic, di-ferulic, and sinapic acids, composition of the phenolic acids fraction in triticale grain of the tested cultivars varied in comparison with that of wheat and rye cultivars. In triticale flour, the number of phenolic acids was nearly 4 times lower than in the grain, as phenolic acids were removed along with bran, in which their proportion was almost 9 times higher than in the grain intended for grinding. The application of bran in the bread recipe resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the fraction of phenolic acids compared to the bread produced from triticale flour without bran addition.
33525332/Serotonin Pathway in Cancer Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biogenic monoamine produced from the essential amino acid tryptophan. Serotonin's role as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and a motility mediator in the gastrointestinal tract has been well defined, and its function in tumorigenesis in various cancers (gliomas, carcinoids, and carcinomas) is being studied. Many studies have shown a potential stimulatory effect of serotonin on cancer cell proliferation, invasion, dissemination, and tumor angiogenesis. Although the underlying mechanism is complex, it is proposed that serotonin levels in the tumor and its interaction with specific receptor subtypes are associated with disease progression. This review article describes serotonin's role in cancer pathogenesis and the utility of the serotonin pathway as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Octreotide, an inhibitor of serotonin release, is used in well-differentiated neuroendocrine cancers, and the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) inhibitor, telotristat, is currently being investigated in clinical trials to treat patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Several in vitro studies have shown the anticancer effect of 5-HT receptor antagonists in various cancers such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, urinary bladder, colorectal cancer, carcinoid, and small-cell lung cancer. More in vivo studies are needed to assess serotonin's role in cancer and its potential use as an anticancer therapeutic target. Serotonin is also being evaluated for its immunoregulatory properties, and studies have shown its potential anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, it would be of interest to explore the combination of serotonin antagonists with immunotherapy in the future.
33513940/The Postnatal Offspring of Finasteride-Treated Male Rats Shows Hyperglycaemia, Elevated Hepatic Glycogen Storage and Altered GLUT2, IR, and AR Expression in the Liver Background: A growing body of data indicates that the physiology of the liver is sex-hormone dependent, with some types of liver failure occurring more frequently in males, and some in females. In males, in physiological conditions, testosterone acts via androgen receptors (AR) to increase insulin receptor (IR) expression and glycogen synthesis, and to decrease glucose uptake controlled by liver-specific glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2). Our previous study indicated that this mechanism may be impaired by finasteride, a popular drug used in urology and dermatology, inhibiting 5alpha-reductase 2, which converts testosterone (T) into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our research has also shown that the offspring of rats exposed to finasteride have an altered T-DHT ratio and show changes in their testes and epididymides. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess whether the administration of finasteride had an trans-generational effect on (i) GLUT-2 dependent accumulation of glycogen in the liver, (ii) IR and AR expression in the hepatocytes of male rat offspring, (iii) a relation between serum T and DHT levels and the expression of GLUT2, IR, and AR mRNAs, (iv) a serum glucose level and it correlation with GLUT-2 mRNA. Methods: The study was conducted on the liver (an androgen-dependent organ) from 7, 14, 21, 28, and 90-day old Wistar male rats (F1:Fin) born by females fertilized by finasteride-treated rats. The control group was the offspring (F1:Control) of untreated Wistar parents. In the histological sections of liver the Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining (to visualize glycogen) and IHC (to detect GLUT-2, IR, and AR) were performed. The liver homogenates were used in qRT-PCR to assess GLUT2, IR, and AR mRNA expression. The percentage of PAS-positive glycogen areas were correlated with the immunoexpression of GLUT-2, serum levels of T and DHT were correlated with GLUT-2, IR, and AR transcript levels, and serum glucose concentration was correlated with the age of animals and with the GLUT-2 mRNA by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: In each age group of F1:Fin rats, the accumulation of glycogen was elevated but did not correlate with changes in GLUT-2 expression. The levels of GLUT-2, IR, and AR transcripts and their immunoreactivity statistically significantly decreased in F1:Fin animals. In F1:Fin rats the serum levels of T and DHT negatively correlated with androgen receptor mRNA. The animals from F1:Fin group have statistically elevated level of glucose. Additionally, in adult F1:Fin rats, steatosis was observed in the liver (see Appendix A). Conclusions: It seems that treating male adult rats with finasteride causes changes in the carbohydrate metabolism in the liver of their offspring. This can lead to improper hepatic energy homeostasis or even hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, as well as some symptoms of metabolic syndrome and liver steatosis.
33494378/Antioxidant Activity and Chemical Characteristics of Supercritical CO2 and Water Extracts from Willow and Poplar Renewable feedstock from perennial industrial crops, including those cultivated on marginal land in a short-rotation coppice system, could be an important contribution to the bioeconomy. The majority of data available on the topic are limited to the production of bioenergy from this type of biomass. According to the concept of bioeconomy, biomass-based bioproducts have priority over energy production. This paper characterizes the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of extracts from bark (b), wood (w) or a mixture of bark and wood (b + w) from Salix purpurea, Salix viminalis and Populus nigra obtained using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), scCO2 and water (1%, w/w) or only water. Generally, a high concentration of polyphenols was obtained after extraction with scCO2 and water, while the lowest concentration was found in extracts obtained with scCO2. The highest concentration of polyphenols (p < 0.05) was obtained in an extract from P. nigra (b) (502.62 +- 9.86 mg GAE/g dry matter (d.m.)) after extraction with scCO2 and water, whereas the lowest polyphenol concentration was observed in an scCO2 extract from S. purpurea (b) (6.02 +- 0.13 mg GAE/g d.m.). The flavonoids were effectively separated by extraction with scCO2 (0.88-18.37 mg QE/g d.m.). A positive linear relationship between the antioxidant activity determined by DPPH and ABTS assays and the concentration of polyphenols was demonstrated, R2 = 0.8377 and R2 = 0.9568, respectively. It is most probable that the concentration of flavonoids, rather than the concentration of polyphenols, determines the chelating activity of Fe2+. The Fe2+-chelating activity of scCO2 extracts ranged from 75.11% (EC50 = 5.41 mg/cm3, S. purpurea, b + w) to 99.43% (EC50 = 0.85 mg/cm3, P. nigra, b + w). The lowest chelating activity was demonstrated by the extracts obtained with scCO2 and water (maximum 26.36%, S. purpurea, b + w). In extracts obtained with scCO2 and water, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (210-428 microg/g), p-coumaric acid (56-281 microg/g), saligenin (142-300 microg/g) and salicortin (16-164 microg/g) were the dominant polyphenols. All of these chemical compounds occurred mainly in the free form. The S. purpurea, S. viminalis and P. nigra biomass proved to be an attractive source of biologically active compounds for various possible applications in food, drugs or cosmetics. These compounds could be extracted using an environmentally friendly method with scCO2 and water as a co-solvent.
33514068/In Silico Assessment of Class I Antiarrhythmic Drug Effects on Pitx2-Induced Atrial Fibrillation: Insights from Populations of Electrophysiological Models of Human Atrial Cells and Tissues Electrical remodelling as a result of homeodomain transcription factor 2 (Pitx2)-dependent gene regulation was linked to atrial fibrillation (AF) and AF patients with single nucleotide polymorphisms at chromosome 4q25 responded favorably to class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). The possible reasons behind this remain elusive. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the AADs disopyramide, quinidine, and propafenone on human atrial arrhythmias mediated by Pitx2-induced remodelling, from a single cell to the tissue level, using drug binding models with multi-channel pharmacology. Experimentally calibrated populations of human atrial action po-tential (AP) models in both sinus rhythm (SR) and Pitx2-induced AF conditions were constructed by using two distinct models to represent morphological subtypes of AP. Multi-channel pharmaco-logical effects of disopyramide, quinidine, and propafenone on ionic currents were considered. Simulated results showed that Pitx2-induced remodelling increased maximum upstroke velocity (dVdtmax), and decreased AP duration (APD), conduction velocity (CV), and wavelength (WL). At the concentrations tested in this study, these AADs decreased dVdtmax and CV and prolonged APD in the setting of Pitx2-induced AF. Our findings of alterations in WL indicated that disopyramide may be more effective against Pitx2-induced AF than propafenone and quinidine by prolonging WL.
33494506/The Sesquiterpene Synthase PtTPS5 Produces (1S,5S,7R,10R)-Guaia-4(15)-en-11-ol and (1S,7R,10R)-Guaia-4-en-11-ol in Oomycete-Infected Poplar Roots Pathogen infection often leads to the enhanced formation of specialized plant metabolites that act as defensive barriers against microbial attackers. In this study, we investigated the formation of potential defense compounds in roots of the Western balsam poplar (Populus trichocarpa) upon infection with the generalist root pathogen Phytophthora cactorum (Oomycetes). P. cactorum infection led to an induced accumulation of terpenes, aromatic compounds, and fatty acids in poplar roots. Transcriptome analysis of uninfected and P. cactorum-infected roots revealed a terpene synthase gene PtTPS5 that was significantly induced upon pathogen infection. PtTPS5 had been previously reported as a sesquiterpene synthase producing two unidentified sesquiterpene alcohols as major products and hedycaryol as a minor product. Using heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, enzyme assays with deuterium-labeled substrates, and NMR analysis of reaction products, we could identify the major PtTPS5 products as (1S,5S,7R,10R)-guaia-4(15)-en-11-ol and (1S,7R,10R)-guaia-4-en-11-ol, with the former being a novel compound. The transcript accumulation of PtTPS5 in uninfected and P. cactorum-infected poplar roots matched the accumulation of (1S,5S,7R,10R)-guaia-4(15)-en-11-ol, (1S,7R,10R)-guaia-4-en-11-ol, and hedycaryol in this tissue, suggesting that PtTPS5 likely contributes to the pathogen-induced formation of these compounds in planta.
33498664/Reactive Oxygen Species Accumulation Strongly Allied with Genetic Male Sterility Convertible to Cytoplasmic Male Sterility in Kenaf Male sterility (MS) plays a key role in the hybrid breed production of plants. Researchers have focused on the association between genetic male sterility (GMS) and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in kenaf. In this study, P9BS (a natural GMS mutant of the kenaf line P9B) and male plants of P9B were used as parents in multiple backcross generations to produce P9SA, a CMS line with stable sterility, to explore the molecular mechanisms of the association between GMS and CMS. The anthers of the maintainer (P9B), GMS (P9BS), and CMS (P9SA) lines were compared through phenotypic, cell morphological, physiological, biochemical observations, and transcriptome analysis. Premature degradation of the tapetum was observed at the mononuclear stage in P9BS and P9SA, which also had lower activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes compared with P9B. Many coexpressed differentially expressed genes were related to ROS balance, including ATP synthase, electron chain transfer, and ROS scavenging processes were upregulated in P9B. CMS plants had a higher ROS accumulation than GMS plants. The MDA content in P9SA was 3.2 times that of P9BS, and therefore, a higher degree of abortion occurred in P9SA, which may indicate that the conversion between CMS and GMS is related to intracellular ROS accumulation. Our study adds new insights into the natural transformation of GMS and CMS in plants in general and kenaf in particular.
33514021/Neuroprotective Effect of Apolipoprotein D in Cuprizone-Induced Cell Line Models: A Potential Therapeutic Approach for Multiple Sclerosis and Demyelinating Diseases Apolipoprotein D (Apo D) overexpression is a general finding across neurodegenerative conditions so the role of this apolipoprotein in various neuropathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS) has aroused a great interest in last years. However, its mode of action, as a promising compound for the development of neuroprotective drugs, is unknown. The aim of this work was to address the potential of Apo D to prevent the action of cuprizone (CPZ), a toxin widely used for developing MS models, in oligodendroglial and neuroblastoma cell lines. On one hand, immunocytochemical quantifications and gene expression measures showed that CPZ compromised neural mitochondrial metabolism but did not induce the expression of Apo D, except in extremely high doses in neurons. On the other hand, assays of neuroprotection demonstrated that antipsychotic drug, clozapine, induced an increase in Apo D synthesis only in the presence of CPZ, at the same time that prevented the loss of viability caused by the toxin. The effect of the exogenous addition of human Apo D, once internalized, was also able to directly revert the loss of cell viability caused by treatment with CPZ by a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-independent mechanism of action. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing Apo D levels, in an endo- or exogenous way, moderately prevents the neurotoxic effect of CPZ in a cell model that seems to replicate some features of MS which would open new avenues in the development of interventions to afford MS-related neuroprotection.
33498785/Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphate Sensing, Transport and Signalling in Streptomyces and Related Actinobacteria Phosphorous, in the form of phosphate, is a key element in the nutrition of all living beings. In nature, it is present in the form of phosphate salts, organophosphates, and phosphonates. Bacteria transport inorganic phosphate by the high affinity phosphate transport system PstSCAB, and the low affinity PitH transporters. The PstSCAB system consists of four components. PstS is the phosphate binding protein and discriminates between arsenate and phosphate. In the Streptomyces species, the PstS protein, attached to the outer side of the cell membrane, is glycosylated and released as a soluble protein that lacks its phosphate binding ability. Transport of phosphate by the PstSCAB system is drastically regulated by the inorganic phosphate concentration and mediated by binding of phosphorylated PhoP to the promoter of the PstSCAB operon. In Mycobacterium smegmatis, an additional high affinity transport system, PhnCDE, is also under PhoP regulation. Additionally, Streptomyces have a duplicated low affinity phosphate transport system encoded by the pitH1-pitH2 genes. In this system phosphate is transported as a metal-phosphate complex in simport with protons. Expression of pitH2, but not that of pitH1 in Streptomyces coelicolor, is regulated by PhoP. Interestingly, in many Streptomyces species, three gene clusters pitH1-pstSCAB-ppk (for a polyphosphate kinase), are linked in a supercluster formed by nine genes related to phosphate metabolism. Glycerol-3-phosphate may be transported by the actinobacteria Corynebacterium glutamicum that contains a ugp gene cluster for glycerol-3-P uptake, but the ugp cluster is not present in Streptomyces genomes. Sugar phosphates and nucleotides are used as phosphate source by the Streptomyces species, but there is no evidence of the uhp gene involved in the transport of sugar phosphates. Sugar phosphates and nucleotides are dephosphorylated by extracellular phosphatases and nucleotidases. An isolated uhpT gene for a hexose phosphate antiporter is present in several pathogenic corynebacteria, such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but not in non-pathogenic ones. Phosphonates are molecules that contains phosphate linked covalently to a carbon atom through a very stable C-P bond. Their utilization requires the phnCDE genes for phosphonates/phosphate transport and genes for degradation, including those for the subunits of the C-P lyase. Strains of the Arthrobacter and Streptomyces genera were reported to degrade simple phosphonates, but bioinformatic analysis reveals that whole sets of genes for putative phosphonate degradation are present only in three Arthrobacter species and a few Streptomyces species. Genes encoding the C-P lyase subunits occur in several Streptomyces species associated with plant roots or with mangroves, but not in the laboratory model Streptomyces species; however, the phnCDE genes that encode phosphonates/phosphate transport systems are frequent in Streptomyces species, suggesting that these genes, in the absence of C-P lyase genes, might be used as surrogate phosphate transporters. In summary, Streptomyces and related actinobacteria seem to be less versatile in phosphate transport systems than Enterobacteria.
33498630/The Chitosan/Agarose/NanoHA Bone Scaffold-Induced M2 Macrophage Polarization and Its Effect on Osteogenic Differentiation In Vitro Chronic immune response to bone implant may lead to delayed healing and its failure. Thus, newly developed biomaterials should be characterized by high biocompatibility. Moreover, it is well known that macrophages play a crucial role in the controlling of biomaterial-induced inflammatory response. Immune cells synthesize also a great amount of signaling molecules that regulate cell differentiation and tissue remodeling. Non-activated macrophages (M0) may be activated (polarized) into two main types of macrophage phenotype: proinflammatory type 1 macrophages (M1) and anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophages (M2). The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of the newly developed chitosan/agarose/nanohydroxyapatite bone scaffold (Polish Patent) on the macrophage polarization and osteogenic differentiation. Obtained results showed that macrophages cultured on the surface of the biomaterial released an elevated level of anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-4, -10, -13, transforming growth factor-beta), which is typical of the M2 phenotype. Moreover, an evaluation of cell morphology confirmed M2 polarization of the macrophages on the surface of the bone scaffold. Importantly, in this study, it was demonstrated that the co-culture of macrophages-seeded biomaterial with bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) or human osteoblasts (hFOB 1.19) enhanced their osteogenic ability, confirming the immunomodulatory effect of the macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation process. Thus, it was proved that the developed biomaterial carries a low risk of inflammatory response and induces macrophage polarization into the M2 phenotype with osteopromotive properties, which makes it a promising bone scaffold for regenerative medicine applications.
33494374/Fluorescent Cytochemical Detection of Polyphosphates Associated with Human Platelets Polyphosphate (polyP) is released from activated platelets and activates the intrinsic coagulation pathway. However, polyP may also be involved in various pathophysiological functions related to platelets. To clarify these functions, we established a cytochemical method to reproducibly visualize polyP in platelets. Platelets obtained from healthy non-smoking donors were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and quickly immobilized on glass slides using a Cytospin. After fixation and membrane permeabilization, platelets were treated with 4',6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and examined using a fluorescence microscope with a blue-violet excitation filter block (BV-2A). Fixed platelets were also subjected to immunocytochemical examination to visualize serotonin distribution. Under the optimized conditions for polyP visualization, immobilized platelets were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 4 h or longer and treated with DAPI at a concentration of 10 microg/mL in 0.02% saponin- or 0.1% Tween-20-containing Hanks balanced salt solution as a permeabilization buffer for 30 min at room temperature (22-25  C). Based on the results obtained by using activated platelets, treatment with alkaline phosphatases, and serotonin release, the DAPI+ targets were identified as polyP. Therefore, this cytochemical method is useful for determining the amount and distribution of polyP in platelets.
33525627/Strain-Specific Effects of Bifidobacterium longum on Hypercholesterolemic Rats and Potential Mechanisms Hypercholesterolemia is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease, which is among the major causes of death worldwide. The aim of this study was to explore whether Bifidobacterium longum strains exerted intra-species differences in cholesterol-lowering effects in hypercholesterolemic rats and to investigate the potential mechanisms. SD rats underwent gavage with each B. longum strain (CCFM 1077, I3, J3 and B3) daily for 28 days. B. longum CCFM 1077 exerted the most potent cholesterol-lowering effect, followed by B. longum I3 and B3, whereas B. longum B3 had no effect in alleviating hypercholesterolemia. Divergent alleviation of different B. longum strains on hypercholesterolemia can be attributed to the differences in bile salt deconjugation ability and cholesterol assimilation ability in vitro. By 16S rRNA metagenomics analysis, the relative abundance of beneficial genus increased in the B. longum CCFM 1077 treatment group. The expression of key genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were also altered after the B. longum CCFM 1077 treatment. In conclusion, B. longum exhibits strain-specific effects in the alleviation of hypercholesterolemia, mainly due to differences in bacterial characteristics, bile salt deconjugation ability, cholesterol assimilation ability, expressions of key genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and alterations of gut microbiota.
33525366/Development of MTH1-Binding Nucleotide Analogs Based on 7,8-Dihalogenated 7-Deaza-dG Derivatives MTH1 is an enzyme that hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP, which is an oxidatively damaged nucleobase, into 8-oxo-dGMP in nucleotide pools to prevent its mis-incorporation into genomic DNA. Selective and potent MTH1-binding molecules have potential as biological tools and drug candidates. We recently developed 8-halogenated 7-deaza-dGTP as an 8-oxo-dGTP mimic and found that it was not hydrolyzed, but inhibited enzyme activity. To further increase MTH1 binding, we herein designed and synthesized 7,8-dihalogenated 7-deaza-dG derivatives. We successfully synthesized multiple derivatives, including substituted nucleosides and nucleotides, using 7-deaza-dG as a starting material. Evaluations of the inhibition of MTH1 activity revealed the strong inhibitory effects on enzyme activity of the 7,8-dihalogenated 7-deaza-dG derivatives, particularly 7,8-dibromo 7-daza-dGTP. Based on the results obtained on kinetic parameters and from computational docking simulating studies, these nucleotide analogs interacted with the active site of MTH1 and competitively inhibited the substrate 8-oxodGTP. Therefore, novel properties of repair enzymes in cells may be elucidated using new compounds.
33494466/DNA-Binding Anticancer Drugs: One Target, Two Actions Amsacrine, an anticancer drug first synthesised in 1970 by Professor Cain and colleagues, showed excellent preclinical activity and underwent clinical trial in 1978 under the auspices of the US National Cancer Institute, showing activity against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In 1984, the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II was identified as a molecular target for amsacrine, acting to poison this enzyme and to induce DNA double-strand breaks. One of the main challenges in the 1980s was to determine whether amsacrine analogues could be developed with activity against solid tumours. A multidisciplinary team was assembled in Auckland, and Professor Denny played a leading role in this approach. Among a large number of drugs developed in the programme, N-[2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl]-acridine-4-carboxamide (DACA), first synthesised by Professor Denny, showed excellent activity against a mouse lung adenocarcinoma. It underwent clinical trial, but dose escalation was prevented by ion channel toxicity. Subsequent work led to the DACA derivative SN 28049, which had increased potency and reduced ion channel toxicity. Mode of action studies suggested that both amsacrine and DACA target the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II but with a different balance of cellular consequences. As primarily a topoisomerase II poison, amsacrine acts to turn the enzyme into a DNA-damaging agent. As primarily topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, DACA and SN 28049 act to inhibit the segregation of daughter chromatids during anaphase. The balance between these two actions, one cell cycle phase specific and the other nonspecific, together with pharmacokinetic, cytokinetic and immunogenic considerations, provides links between the actions of acridine derivatives and anthracyclines such as doxorubicin. They also provide insights into the action of cytotoxic DNA-binding drugs.
33498635/Differential Role of Threonine and Tyrosine Phosphorylation in the Activation and Activity of the Yeast MAPK Slt2 The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Slt2 is central to signaling through the yeast Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway. MAPKs are regulated by phosphorylation at both the threonine and tyrosine of the conserved TXY motif within the activation loop (T190/Y192 in Slt2). Since phosphorylation at both sites results in the full activation of MAPKs, signaling through MAPK pathways is monitored with antibodies that detect dually phosphorylated forms. However, most of these antibodies also recognize monophosphorylated species, whose relative abundance and functionality are diverse. By using different phosphospecific antibodies and phosphate-affinity (Phos-tag) analysis on distinct Slt2 mutants, we determined that Y192- and T190-monophosphorylated species coexist with biphosphorylated Slt2, although most of the Slt2 pool remains unphosphorylated following stress. Among the monophosphorylated forms, only T190 exhibited biological activity. Upon stimulation, Slt2 is first phosphorylated at Y192, mainly by the MAPKK Mkk1, and this phosphorylation is important for the subsequent T190 phosphorylation. Similarly, dephosphorylation of Slt2 by the Dual Specificity Phosphatase (DSP) Msg5 is ordered, with dephosphorylation of T190 depending on previous Y192 dephosphorylation. Whereas Y192 phosphorylation enhances the Slt2 catalytic activity, T190 is essential for this activity. The conserved T195 residue is also critical for Slt2 functionality. Mutations that abolish the activity of Slt2 result in a high increase in inactive Y192-monophosphorylated Slt2. The coexistence of different Slt2 phosphoforms with diverse biological significance highlights the importance of the precise detection of the Slt2 phosphorylation status.
33530499/Surface Permeability of Membrane and Catalytic Performance Based on Redox-Responsive of Hybrid Hollow Polymeric Microcapsules "Smart" polymeric microcapsules with excellent permeability of membranes have drawn considerable attention in scientific and industrial research such as drug delivery carriers, microreactors, and artificial organelles. In this work, hybrid hollow polymeric microcapsules (HPs) containing redox-active gold-sulfide bond were prepared with bovine serum albumin, inorganic metal cluster (AuNCs), and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) conjugates by using Pickering emulsion method. HPs were transferred from water-in-oil to water-in-water by adding PEGbis(N-succinimidylsuccinate). To achieve redox-responsive membrane, the Au-S bond units incorporated into the microcapsules' membranes, allowed us to explore the effects of a new stimuli, that is, the redox Au-S bond breaking on the microcapsules' membranes. The permeability of these hybrid hollow polymeric microcapsules could be sensitively tuned via adding environment-friendly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), resulting from a fast fracture of Au-S bond. Meanwhile, AuNCs and conjugates could depart from the microcapsules, and enhance the permeability of the membrane. Based on the excellent permeability of the membrane, phosphatase was encapsuled into HPs and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. After adding 1 x 10-2 and 1 x 10-4 M H2O2, the catalytic efficiency was nearly 4.06 and 2.22 times higher than that of HPs in the absence of H2O2, respectively. Hence, the unique redox-responsive HPs have potential applications in biocatalytic reaction, drug delivery, and materials as well as in bioscience.
33494519/Bicyclic Basic Merbarone Analogues as Antiproliferative Agents Pyrimido-pyrimidine derivatives have been developed as rigid merbarone analogues. In a previous study, these compounds showed potent antiproliferative activity and efficiently inhibited topoisomerase IIalpha. To further extend the structure-activity relationships on pyrimido-pyrimidines, a novel series of analogues was synthesized by a two-step procedure. Analogues 3-6 bear small alky groups at positions 1 and 3 of the pyrimido-pyrimidine scaffold whereas at position 6a (4-chloro)phenyl substituent was inserted. The basic side chains introduced at position 7 were selected on the basis of the previously developed structure-activity relationships. The antiproliferative activity of the novel compounds proved to be affected by both the nature of the basic side chain and the substituents on the pyrimido-pyrimidine moiety. Derivatives 5d and 5e were identified as the most promising molecules still showing reduced antiproliferative activity in comparison with the previously prepared pyrimido-pyrimidine analogues. In topoisomerase IIalpha-5d docking complex, the ligand would poorly interact with the enzyme and assume a different orientation in comparison with 1d bioactive conformation.
33530628/Processing Methodologies of Wet Microalga Biomass Toward Oil Separation: An Overview One of the main goals of Mankind is to ensure food system sustainability:including management of land, soil, water, and biodiversity. Microalgae accordingly appear as an innovative and scalable alternative source in view of the richness of their chemical profiles. In what concerns lipids in particular, microalgae can synthesize and accumulate significant amounts of fatty acids, a great fraction of which are polyunsaturated; this makes them excellent candidates within the framework of production and exploitation of lipids by various industrial and health sectors, either as bulk products or fine chemicals. Conventional lipid extraction methodologies require previous dehydration of microalgal biomass, which hampers economic feasibility due to the high energy demands thereof. Therefore, extraction of lipids directly from wet biomass would be a plus in this endeavor. Supporting processes and methodologies are still limited, and most approaches are empirical in nature:so a deeper mechanistic elucidation is a must, in order to facilitate rational optimization of the extraction processes. Besides circumventing the current high energy demands by dehydration, an ideal extraction method should be selective, sustainable, efficient, harmless, and feasible for upscale to industrial level. This review presents and discusses several pretreatments incurred in lipid extraction from wet microalga biomass, namely recent developments and integrated processes. Unfortunately, most such developments have been proven at bench-scale only:so demonstration in large facilities is still needed to confirm whether they can turn into competitive alternatives.
33525494/Metabolic Transition of Milk Triacylglycerol Synthesis in Response to Varying Levels of Three 18-Carbon Fatty Acids in Porcine Mammary Epithelial Cells This study aimed to examine the effects of increasing levels of three 18-carbon fatty acids (stearate, oleate and linoleate) on mammary lipogenesis, and to evaluate their effects on the milk lipogenic pathway in porcine mammary epithelial cells (pMECs). We found that increasing the three of 18-carbon fatty acids enhanced the cellular lipid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, as reflected by the increased (triacylglycerol) TAG content and cytosolic lipid droplets in pMECs. The increased lipid synthesis by the three 18-carbon fatty acids was probably caused by the up-regulated expression of major genes associated with milk fat biosynthesis, including CD36 (long chain fatty acid uptake); GPAM, AGPAT6, DGAT1 (TAG synthesis); PLIN2 (lipid droplet formation); and PPARgamma (regulation of transcription). Western blot analysis of CD36, DGAT1 and PPARgamma proteins confirmed this increase with the increasing incubation of 18-carbon fatty acids. Interestingly, the mRNA expressions of ACSL3 and FABP3 (fatty acids intracellular activation and transport) were differentially affected by the three 18-carbon fatty acids. The cellular mRNA expressions of ACSL3 and FABP3 were increased by stearate, but were decreased by oleate or linoleate. However, the genes involved in fatty acid de novo synthesis (ACACA and FASN) and the regulation of transcription (SREBP1) were decreased by incubation with increasing concentrations of 18-carbon fatty acids. In conclusion, our findings provided evidence that 18-carbon fatty acids (stearate, oleate and linoleate) significantly increased cytosolic TAG accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, probably by promoting lipogenic genes and proteins that regulate the channeling of fatty acids towards milk TAG synthesis in pMECs.
33530617/Ovalitenone Inhibits the Migration of Lung Cancer Cells via the Suppression of AKT/mTOR and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Cancer metastasis is the major cause of about 90% of cancer deaths. As epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known for potentiating metastasis, this study aimed to elucidate the effect of ovalitenone on the suppression of EMT and metastasis-related behaviors, including cell movement and growth under detached conditions, and cancer stem cells (CSCs), of lung cancer cells. Methods: Cell viability and cell proliferation were determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazo-liumbromide (MTT) and colony formation assays. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed using a wound-healing assay and Boyden chamber assay, respectively. Anchorage-independent cell growth was determined. Cell protrusions (filopodia) were detected by phalloidin-rhodamine staining. Cancer stem cell phenotypes were assessed by spheroid formation. The proteins involved in cell migration and EMT were evaluated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Results: Ovalitenone was used at concentrations of 0-200 muM. While it caused no cytotoxic effects on lung cancer H460 and A549 cells, ovalitenone significantly suppressed anchorage-independent growth, CSC-like phenotypes, colony formation, and the ability of the cancer to migrate and invade cells. The anti-migration activity was confirmed by the reduction of filopodia in the cells treated with ovalitenone. Interestingly, we found that ovalitenone could significantly decrease the levels of N-cadherin, snail, and slug, while it increased E-cadherin, indicating EMT suppression. Additionally, the regulatory signaling of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (AKT), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) was suppressed by ovalitenone. Conclusions: The results suggest that ovalitenone suppresses EMT via suppression of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, ovalitenone exhibited potential for the suppression of CSC phenotypes. These data reveal the anti-metastasis potential of the compound and support the development of ovalitenone treatment for lung cancer therapy.
33494465/Zingiber officinale Roscoe Rhizomes Attenuate Oxaliplatin-Induced Neuropathic Pain in Mice Oxaliplatin is a platinum derivative chemotherapeutic drug widely used against cancers, but even a single treatment can induce a severe allodynia that requires treatment interruption and dose diminution. The rhizome of Zingiber officinale roscoe (Z. officinale, ginger), has been widely used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases causing pain; however, its effect against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain has never been assessed. In mice, a single oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment induced significant cold and mechanical allodynia. Cold and mechanical allodynia were assessed by acetone drop and von Frey filament tests, respectively. Water extracts of Z. officinale (100, 300, and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated both cold and mechanical allodynia induced by oxaliplatin. Intrathecal pre-treatment with the antagonist 5-HT1A (NAN-190, i.t., 1 mug), but not with the antagonist 5-HT2A (ketanserin, i.t., 1 mug), significantly blocked the analgesic effect of Z. officinale against both cold and mechanical allodynia. However, 5-HT3 antagonist (MDL-72222, i.t., 15 mug) administration only blocked the anti-allodynic effect of Z. officinale against cold allodynia. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that Z. officinale significantly increased the mRNA expression of the spinal 5-HT1A receptor that was downregulated after oxaliplatin injection. These results suggest that Z. officinale may be a viable treatment option for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain.
33572899/Establishment and Long-Term Expansion of Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids Differential chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells, which is attributed to the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variation of cancer cells, is considered to be the main reason for tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Here, we generated small cell lung cancer patient-derived tumor organoids and subjected them to long-term expansion with the addition of WNT3A or R-spondin1. We confirmed that the organoids have similar genetic profiles, molecular characteristics, and morphological architectures to the corresponding patient tumor tissue during and after long-term expansion. Interestingly, the cellular heterogeneity of organoids is reflected in their differential response to cisplatin or etoposide. We propose to utilize the organoids as small cell lung cancer patient avatar models that would be ideal for investigating the mechanisms underlying tumor recurrence after chemotherapy, and would ultimately help to develop personalized medicine.
33572873/Structural Features and Phylogenetic Implications of Four New Mitogenomes of Caliscelidae (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha) To explore the differences in mitogenome variation and phylogenetics among lineages of the Hemiptera superfamily Fulgoroidea, we sequenced four new mitogenomes of Caliscelidae: two species of the genus Bambusicaliscelis (Caliscelinae: Caliscelini), namely Bambusicaliscelis flavus and B. fanjingensis, and two species of the genus Youtuus (Ommatidiotinae: Augilini), namely Youtuus strigatus and Y. erythrus. The four mitogenomes were 15,922-16,640 bp (base pair) in length, with 37 mitochondrial genes and an AT-rich region. Gene content and arrangement were similar to those of most other sequenced hexapod mitogenomes. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) started with a canonical ATN or GTG and ended with TAA or an incomplete stop codon single T. Except for two transfer RNAs (tRNAs; trnS1 and trnV) lacking a dihydrouridine arm in the four species and trnC lacking a dihydrouridine stem in the Youtuus species, the remaining tRNAs could fold into canonical cloverleaf secondary structures. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequence data of 13 PCGs in the 28 Fulgoroidea species and two outgroups revealed that Delphacidae was monophyletic with strong support. Our data suggest that Fulgoridae is more ancient than Achilidae. Furthermore, Flatidae, Issidae, and Ricaniidae always cluster to form a sister group to Caliscelidae.
33573055/Density Functional Theory-Based Calculation Shed New Light on the Bizarre Addition of Cysteine Thiol to Dopaquinone Two types of melanin pigments, brown to black eumelanin and yellow to reddish brown pheomelanin, are biosynthesized through a branched reaction, which is associated with the key intermediate dopaquinone (DQ). In the presence of l-cysteine, DQ immediately binds to the -SH group, resulting in the formation of cysteinyldopa necessary for the pheomelanin production. l-Cysteine prefers to bond with aromatic carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, namely C5 and C2. Surprisingly, this Michael addition takes place at 1,6-position of the C5 (and to some extent at C2) rather than usually expected 1,4-position. Such an anomaly on the reactivity necessitates an atomic-scale understanding of the binding mechanism. Using density functional theory-based calculations, we investigated the binding of l-cysteine thiolate (Cys-S-) to DQ. Interestingly, the C2-S bonded intermediate was less energetically stable than the C6-S bonded case. Furthermore, the most preferred Cys-S--attacked intermediate is at the carbon-carbon bridge between the two carbonyls (C3-C4 bridge site) but not on the C5 site. This structure allows the Cys-S- to migrate onto the adjacent C5 or C2 with small activation energies. Further simulation demonstrated a possible conversion pathway of the C5-S (and C2-S) intermediate into 5-S-cysteinyldopa (and 2-S-cysteinyldopa), which is the experimentally identified major (and minor) product. Based on the results, we propose that the binding of Cys-S- to DQ proceeds via the following path: (i) coordination of Cys-S- to C3-C4 bridge, (ii) migration of Cys-S- to C5 (C2), (iii) proton rearrangement from cysteinyl -NH3+ to O4 (O3), and (iv) proton rearrangement from C5 (C2) to O3 (O4).
33572992/Spermidine Attenuates Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis via Blocking Ca2+ Overload in Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Independently of ROS Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells occupy the outer layer of the retina and perform various biological functions. Oxidative damage to RPE cells is a major risk factor for retinal degeneration that ultimately leads to vision loss. In this study, we investigated the role of spermidine in a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress model using human RPE cells. Our findings showed that 300 muM H2O2 increased cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, whereas these effects were markedly suppressed by 10 muM spermidine. Furthermore, spermidine significantly reduced H2O2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction including mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial activity. Although spermidine displays antioxidant properties, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon H2O2 insult was not regulated by spermidine. Spermidine did suppress the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels resulting from endoplasmic reticulum stress in H2O2-stimulated human RPE cells. Treatment with a cytosolic Ca2+ chelator markedly reversed H2O2-induced cellular dysfunction. Overall, spermidine protected against H2O2-induced cellular damage by blocking the increase of intracellular Ca2+ independently of ROS. These results suggest that spermidine protects RPE cells from oxidative stress, which could be a useful treatment for retinal diseases.
33572981/Effects of Subchronic Administrations of Vortioxetine, Lurasidone, and Escitalopram on Thalamocortical Glutamatergic Transmission Associated with Serotonin 5-HT7 Receptor The functional suppression of serotonin (5-HT) type 7 receptor (5-HT7R) is forming a basis for scientific discussion in psychopharmacology due to its rapid-acting antidepressant-like action. A novel mood-stabilizing atypical antipsychotic agent, lurasidone, exhibits a unique receptor-binding profile, including a high affinity for 5-HT7R antagonism. A member of a novel class of antidepressants, vortioxetine, which is a serotonin partial agonist reuptake inhibitor (SPARI), also exhibits a higher affinity for serotonin transporter, serotonin receptors type 1A (5-HT1AR) and type 3 (5-HT3R), and 5-HT7R. However, the effects of chronic administration of lurasidone, vortioxetine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), escitalopram, on 5-HT7R function remained to be clarified. Thus, to explore the mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of vortioxetine, escitalopram, and lurasidone, the present study determined the effects of these agents on thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission, which contributes to emotional/mood perception, using multiprobe microdialysis and 5-HT7R expression using capillary immunoblotting. Acute local administration of a 5-HT7R agonist and antagonist into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDTN) enhanced and reduced thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission, induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/glutamate receptor inhibition in the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN). Acute local administration of a relevant therapeutic concentration of vortioxetine and lurasidone into the MDTN suppressed the thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission via 5-HT7R inhibition, whereas that of escitalopram activated 5-HT7R. Subchronic administration of effective doses of vortioxetine and lurasidone (for 7 days) reduced the thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission, but escitalopram did not affect it, whereas subchronic administration of these three agents attenuated the stimulatory effects of the 5-HT7R agonist on thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission. Subchronic administration of effective doses of vortioxetine, lurasidone, and escitalopram downregulated the 5-HT7R expression of the plasma membrane in the MDTN; the 5-HT7R downregulation induced by vortioxetine and lurasidone was observed at 3 days, but that induced by escitalopram required a longer duration of 7 days. These results indicate that chronic administration of vortioxetine, escitalopram, and lurasidone generate downregulation of 5-HT7R in the thalamus; however, the direct inhibition of 5-HT7R associated with vortioxetine and lurasidone generates more rapid downregulation than the indirect elevation of the extracellular serotonin level via serotonin transporter inhibition by escitalopram.
33572987/A Pipeline towards the Biochemical Characterization of the Arabidopsis GT14 Family Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the synthesis of glycosidic linkages and are essential in the biosynthesis of glycans, glycoconjugates (glycolipids and glycoproteins), and glycosides. Plant genomes generally encode many more GTs than animal genomes due to the synthesis of a cell wall and a wide variety of glycosylated secondary metabolites. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome is predicted to encode over 573 GTs that are currently classified into 42 diverse families. The biochemical functions of most of these GTs are still unknown. In this study, we updated the JBEI Arabidopsis GT clone collection by cloning an additional 105 GT cDNAs, 508 in total (89%), into Gateway-compatible vectors for downstream characterization. We further established a functional analysis pipeline using transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) followed by enzymatic assays, fractionation of enzymatic products by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and characterization by mass spectrometry (MS). Using the GT14 family as an exemplar, we outline a strategy for identifying effective substrates of GT enzymes. By addition of UDP-GlcA as donor and the synthetic acceptors galactose-nitrobenzodiazole (Gal-NBD), beta-1,6-galactotetraose (beta-1,6-Gal4) and beta-1,3-galactopentose (beta-1,3-Gal5) to microsomes expressing individual GT14 enzymes, we verified the beta-glucuronosyltransferase (GlcAT) activity of three members of this family (AtGlcAT14A, B, and E). In addition, a new family member (AT4G27480, 248) was shown to possess significantly higher activity than other GT14 enzymes. Our data indicate a likely role in arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) biosynthesis for these GT14 members. Together, the updated Arabidopsis GT clone collection and the biochemical analysis pipeline present an efficient means to identify and characterize novel GT catalytic activities. 
33573052/Plantar Mechanical Stimulation Maintains Slow Myosin Expression in Disused Rat Soleus Muscle via NO-Dependent Signaling It was observed that gravitational unloading during space missions and simulated microgravity in ground-based studies leads to both transformation of slow-twitch muscle fibers into fast-twitch fibers and to the elimination of support afferentation, leading to the "switching-off" of postural muscle motor units electrical activity. In recent years, plantar mechanical stimulation (PMS) has been found to maintain the neuromuscular activity of the hindlimb muscles. Nitric oxide (NO) was shown to be one of the mediators of muscle fiber activity, which can also promote slow-type myosin expression. We hypothesized that applying PMS during rat hindlimb unloading would lead to NO production upregulation and prevention of the unloading-induced slow-to-fast fiber-type shift in rat soleus muscles. To test this hypothesis, Wistar rats were hindlimb suspended and subjected to daily PMS, and one group of PMS-subjected animals was also treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME). We discovered that PMS led to sustained NO level in soleus muscles of the suspended animals, and NOS inhibitor administration blocked this effect, as well as the positive effects of PMS on myosin I and IIa mRNA transcription and slow-to-fast fiber-type ratio during rat hindlimb unloading. The results of the study indicate that NOS activity is necessary for the PMS-mediated prevention of slow-to-fast fiber-type shift and myosin I and IIa mRNA transcription decreases during rat hindlimb unloading.
33572934/Folinate Supplementation Ameliorates Methotrexate Induced Mitochondrial Formate Depletion In Vitro and In Vivo (1) Background: Antifolate methotrexate (MTX) is the most common disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for treating human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The mitochondrial-produced formate is essential for folate-mediated one carbon (1C) metabolism. The impacts of MTX on formate homeostasis in unknown, and rigorously controlled kinetic studies can greatly help in this regard. (2) Methods: Combining animal model (8-week old female C57BL/6JNarl mice, n = 18), cell models, stable isotopic tracer studies with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) platforms, we systematically investigated how MTX interferes with the partitioning of mitochondrial and cytosolic formate metabolism. (3) Results: MTX significantly reduced de novo deoxythymidylate (dTMP) and methionine biosyntheses from mitochondrial-derived formate in cells, mouse liver, and bone marrow, supporting our postulation that MTX depletes mitochondrial 1C supply. Furthermore, MTX inhibited formate generation from mitochondria glycine cleavage system (GCS) both in vitro and in vivo. Folinate selectively rescued 1C metabolic pathways in a tissue-, cellular compartment-, and pathway-specific manner: folinate effectively reversed the inhibition of mitochondrial formate-dependent 1C metabolism in mouse bone marrow (dTMP, methionine, and GCS) and cells (dTMP and GCS) but not methionine synthesis in liver/liver-derived cells. Folinate failed to fully recover hepatic mitochondrial-formate utilization for methionine synthesis, suggesting that the efficacy of clinical folinate rescue in MTX therapy on hepatic methionine metabolism is poor. (4) Conclusion: Conducting studies in mouse and cell models, we demonstrate novel findings that MTX specifically depletes mitochondrial 1C supply that can be ameliorated by folinate supplementation except for hepatic transmethylation. These results imply that clinical use of low-dose MTX may particularly impede 1C metabolism via depletion of mitochondrial formate. The MTX induced systematic and tissue-specific formate depletion needs to be addressed more carefully, and the efficacy of folinate with respect to protecting against such depletion deserves to be evaluated in medical practice.
33573037/Moonlighting Proteins Shine New Light on Molecular Signaling Niches Plants as sessile organisms face daily environmental challenges and have developed highly nuanced signaling systems to enable suitable growth, development, defense, or stalling responses. Moonlighting proteins have multiple tasks and contribute to cellular signaling cascades where they produce additional variables adding to the complexity or fuzziness of biological systems. Here we examine roles of moonlighting kinases that also generate 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in plants. These proteins include receptor like kinases and lipid kinases. Their guanylate cyclase activity potentiates the development of localized cGMP-enriched nanodomains or niches surrounding the kinase and its interactome. These nanodomains contribute to allosteric regulation of kinase and other molecules in the immediate complex directly or indirectly modulating signal cascades. Effects include downregulation of kinase activity, modulation of other members of the protein complexes such as cyclic nucleotide gated channels and potential triggering of cGMP-dependent degradation cascades terminating signaling. The additional layers of information provided by the moonlighting kinases are discussed in terms of how they may be used to provide a layer of fuzziness to effectively modulate cellular signaling cascades.
33549076/Ursolic acid induces apoptosis and anoikis in colorectal carcinoma RKO cells Background Ursolic acid (UA) is an anti-cancer herbal compound. In the present study, we observed the effects of UA on anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of human colorectal cancer (CRC) RKO cells. Methods RKO cells were cultured in conventional and detached condition and treated with UA. Cell viability was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was identified by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Activities of caspases were measured by commercial kits. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was recognized by DCFH-DA fluorescent staining. Anoikis was identified by EthD-1 fluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis. Expression and phosphorylation of proteins were analyzed by western blot. Results UA inhibited RKO cell viability in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. UA arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. UA inhibited Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax expression. In addition, UA up-regulated the level of ROS that contributed to UA activated caspase-3, - 8 and - 9, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, UA inhibited cell growth in a detached condition and induced anoikis in RKO cells that was accompanied by dampened phosphorylation of FAK, PI3K and AKT. UA also inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as indicated by the down-regulation of N-Cad expression and up-regulation of E-Cad expression. Conclusions UA induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, and FAK/PI3K/AKT singling and EMT related anoikis in RKO cells. UA was an effective anti-cancer compound against both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of RKO cells.

33549034/Diallyl thiosulfinate enhanced the anti-cancer activity of dexamethasone in the side population cells of multiple myeloma by promoting miR-127-3p and deactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway Background Side population (SP) cells, which have similar features to those of cancer stem cells, show resistance to dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. Thus, new drugs that can be used in combination with Dex to reduce the population of SP cells in multiple myeloma (MM) are required. Diallyl thiosulfinate (DATS, allicin), a natural organosulfur compound derived from garlic, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of SP cells in MM cell lines. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a combination of DATS and Dex (DAT + Dex) on MM SP cells. Methods SP cells were sorted from MM RPMI-8226 and NCI-H929 cell lines using Hoechst 33342-labeled fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The growth of SP cells was evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis assays were conducted using a BD Calibur flow cytometer. miRNA expression was measured using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), AKT, p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and mTOR levels were measured using western blot analysis. Results Our results showed that the combination of DATS+Dex inhibited sphere formation, colony formation, and proliferation of MM SP cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase. In addition, the combination of DATS+Dex promoted miR-127-3p expression and inhibited PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR expression in SP cells. Knockdown of miR-127-3p expression weakened the effect of DATS+Dex on cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of MM SP cells. Additionally, knockdown of miR-127-3p activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in MM SP cells cotreated with DATS+Dex. Conclusion We demonstrated that cotreatment with DATS+Dex reduced cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest of MM SP cells by promoting miR-127-3p expression and deactivating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

33549065/Cisplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in postmenopausal women with previously untreated advanced cervical cancer: a retrospective study Background The aim of this study was to assess the survival outcomes of cisplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (CPB) versus cisplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy alone (CPA) in postmenopausal women with previously untreated advanced cervical cancer (CC). Methods Consecutive postmenopausal women who experienced CPB or CPA were identified retrospectively from our medical centre during 2015-2019. Follow-up visits occurred 1 and 3 months after starting CPB or CPA. Afterwards, this assessment was conducted every 3 months for 1 year and then yearly thereafter. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints were the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs). Results Two hundred forty-six postmenopausal women were included (CPB, n = 124; CPA, n = 122). The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 24 months (range, 2-32). At the final follow-up, a significant difference was detected in terms of median OS (16.4 months [95% CI, 15.3-17.1] for CPB vs. 12.3 months [95% CI, 10.2-13.5] for CPA; hazard ratio (HR) 0.69, 95% CI, 0.49-0.99; p = 0.001), and the median PFS was longer in the CPB group than in the CPA group (9.2 months [95% CI, 8.3-10.7] vs. 7.9 months (95% CI, 6.1-8.6) (HR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.47-0.82; p < 0.001). There were significant differences in the number of AEs between the groups (hypertension grade >= 2 [p < 0.001], neutropenia grade >= 4 [p < 0.001], and thrombosis/embolism grade >= 3 [p = 0.030]). Conclusions Among postmenopausal women with previously untreated advanced CC, those who received CPB experienced superior survival benefits compared to those who received CPA. The safety profile for CPB was controllable despite the long duration of CPB use.
33573145/Hyperbaric Oxygen Preconditioning Upregulates Heme OxyGenase-1 and Anti-Apoptotic Bcl-2 Protein Expression in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats with Induced Postischemic Acute Kidney Injury Renal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury is the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). Pathogenesis of postischemic AKI involves hemodynamic changes, oxidative stress, inflammation process, calcium ion overloading, apoptosis and necrosis. Up to date, therapeutic approaches to treat AKI are extremely limited. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning on citoprotective enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins expression, in postischemic AKI induced in normotensive Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The animals were randomly divided into six experimental groups: SHAM-operated Wistar rats (W-SHAM), Wistar rats with induced postischemic AKI (W-AKI) and Wistar group with HBO preconditioning before AKI induction (W-AKI + HBO). On the other hand, SHR rats were also divided into same three groups: SHR-SHAM, SHR-AKI and SHR-AKI + HBO. We demonstrated that HBO preconditioning upregulated HO-1 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression, in both Wistar and SH rats. In addition, HBO preconditioning improved glomerular filtration rate, supporting by significant increase in creatinine, urea and phosphate clearances in both rat strains. Considering our results, we can also say that even in hypertensive conditions, we can expect protective effects of HBO preconditioning in experimental model of AKI.
33573271/Asciminib Mitigates DNA Damage Stress Signaling Induced by Cyclophosphamide in the Ovary Cancer treatments can often adversely affect the quality of life of young women. One of the most relevant negative impacts is the loss of fertility. Cyclophosphamide is one of the most detrimental chemotherapeutic drugs for the ovary. Cyclophosphamide may induce the destruction of dormant follicles while promoting follicle activation and growth. Herein, we demonstrate the in vivo protective effect of the allosteric Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor Asciminib on signaling pathways activated by cyclophosphamide in mouse ovaries. We also provide evidence that Asciminib does not interfere with the cytotoxic effect of cyclophosphamide in Michigan Cancer Foundation (MCF)7 breast cancer cells. Our data indicate that concomitant administration of Asciminib mitigates the cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian reserve loss without affecting the anticancer potential of cyclophosphamide. Taken together, these observations are relevant for the development of effective ferto-protective adjuvants to preserve the ovarian reserve from the damaging effects of cancer therapies.
33573263/Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporters Mediate the Import of Nicotinamide Riboside and Nicotinic Acid Riboside into Human Cells Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a new form of vitamin B3, is an effective precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in human and animal cells. The introduction of NR into the body effectively increases the level of intracellular NAD+ and thereby restores physiological functions that are weakened or lost in experimental models of aging and various pathologies. Despite the active use of NR in applied biomedicine, the mechanism of its transport into mammalian cells is currently not understood. In this study, we used overexpression of proteins in HEK293 cells, and metabolite detection by NMR, to show that extracellular NR can be imported into cells by members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family ENT1, ENT2, and ENT4. After being imported into cells, NR is readily metabolized resulting in Nam generation. Moreover, the same ENT-dependent mechanism can be used to import the deamidated form of NR, nicotinic acid riboside (NAR). However, NAR uptake into HEK293 cells required the stimulation of its active utilization in the cytosol such as phosphorylation by NR kinase. On the other hand, we did not detect any NR uptake mediated by the concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT) CNT1, CNT2, or CNT3, while overexpression of CNT3, but not CNT1 or CNT2, moderately stimulated NAR utilization by HEK293 cells.
33573178/Effects of Physiological Doses of Resveratrol and Quercetin on Glucose Metabolism in Primary Myotubes Phenolic compounds have emerged in recent years as an option to face insulin resistance and diabetes. The central aim of this study was: (1) to demonstrate that physiological doses of resveratrol (RSV) or quercetin (Q) can influence glucose metabolism in human myotubes, (2) to establish whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase B -PKB- (Akt) pathways are involved in this effect. In addition, the effects of these polyphenols on mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation were analysed. Myotubes from healthy donors were cultured for 24 h with either 0.1 muM of RSV or with 10 muM of Q. Glucose metabolism, such as glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and lactate production, were measured with D[U-14C]glucose. beta-oxidation using [1-14C]palmitate as well as the expression of key metabolic genes and proteins by Real Time PCR and Western blot were also assessed. Although RSV and Q increased pgc1alpha expression, they did not significantly change either glucose oxidation or beta-oxidation. Q increased AMPK, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and AS160 phosphorylation in basal conditions and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3beta) in insulin-stimulated conditions. RSV tended to increase the phosphorylation rates of AMPK and GSK3beta. Both of the polyphenols increased insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and reduced lactate production in human myotubes. Thus, physiological doses of RSV or Q may exhibit anti-diabetic actions in human myotubes.
33573153/Urinary Levels of the Acrolein Conjugates of Carnosine Are Associated with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Carnosine is a naturally occurring dipeptide (beta-alanine-L-histidine) which supports physiological homeostasis by buffering intracellular pH, chelating metals, and conjugating with and neutralizing toxic aldehydes such as acrolein. However, it is not clear if carnosine can support cardiovascular function or modify cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. To examine this, we measured urinary levels of nonconjugated carnosine and its acrolein conjugates (carnosine-propanal and carnosine-propanol) in participants of the Louisville Healthy Heart Study and examined associations with indices of CVD risk. We found that nonconjugated carnosine was significantly associated with hypertension (p = 0.011), heart failure (p = 0.015), those categorized with high CVD risk (p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI; p = 0.007), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; p = 0.026), high-density lipoprotein (HDL; p = 0.007) and certain medication uses. Levels of carnosine-propanal and carnosine-propanol demonstrated significant associations with BMI, blood glucose, HDL and diagnosis of diabetes. Carnosine-propanal was also associated with heart failure (p = 0.045) and hyperlipidemia (p = 0.002), but no associations with myocardial infarction or stroke were identified. We found that the positive associations of carnosine conjugates with diabetes and HDL remain statistically significant (p < 0.05) in an adjusted, linear regression model. These findings suggest that urinary levels of nonconjugated carnosine, carnosine-propanal and carnosine-propanol may be informative biomarkers for the assessment of CVD risk:and particularly reflective of skeletal muscle injury and carnosine depletion in diabetes.
33573215/Trichostatin A-Assisted Epigenomic Modulation Affects the Expression Profiles of Not Only Recombinant Human alpha1,2-Fucosyltransferase and alpha-Galactosidase A Enzymes But Also Galalpha1 3Gal Epitopes in Porcine Bi-Transgenic Adult Cutaneous Fibroblast Cells This study was conducted to explore whether trichostatin A-assisted epigenomic modulation (TSA-EM) can affect the expression of not only recombinant human alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase (rhalpha1,2-FT) and alpha-galactosidase A (rhalpha-Gal A) immune system enzymes but also Galalpha1 3Gal epitopes in ex vivo proliferating adult cutaneous fibroblast cells (ACFCs) derived from hFUT2xhGLA bi-transgenic pigs that had been produced for the needs of future xenotransplantation efforts. The ACFC lines were treated with 50 nM TSA for 24 h and then the expression profiles of rhalpha1,2-FT and rhalpha-Gal A enzymes were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The expression profiles of the Galalpha1 3Gal epitope were determined by lectin blotting and lectin fluorescence. The ACFCs derived from non-transgenic (nTG) pigs were served as the negative (TSA-) and positive (TSA+) control groups. For both hFUT2xhGLA and nTG samples, the expression levels of alpha1,2-FT and alpha-Gal A proteins in TSA+ cells were more than twofold higher in comparison to TSA- cells. Moreover, a much lower expression of the Galalpha1 3Gal epitopes was shown in TSA- hFUT2xhGLA cells as compared to the TSA- nTG group. Interestingly, the levels of Galalpha1 3Gal expression in TSA-treated hFUT2xhGLA and nTG ACFCs were significantly higher than those noticed for their TSA-untreated counterparts. Summing up, ex vivo protection of effectively selected bi-transgenic ACFC lines, in which TSA-dependent epigenetic transformation triggered the enhancements in reprogrammability and subsequent expression of hFUT2 and hGLA transgenes and their corresponding transcripts, allows for cryopreservation of nuclear donor cells, nuclear-transferred female gametes, and resultant porcine cloned embryos. The latter can be used as a cryogenically conserved genetic resource of biological materials suitable for generation of bi-transgenic cloned offspring in pigs that is targeted at biomedical research in the field of cell/tissue xenotransplantation.
33573095/Prominent Indomethacin-Induced Enteropathy in Fcgriib Defi-cient lupus Mice: An Impact of Macrophage Responses and Immune Deposition in Gut A high dose of NSAIDs, a common analgesic, might induce lupus activity through several NSAIDs adverse effects including gastrointestinal permeability defect (gut leakage) and endotoxemia. Indomethacin (25 mg/day) was orally administered for 7 days in 24-wk-old Fc gamma receptor IIb deficient (FcgRIIb-/-) mice, an asymptomatic lupus model (increased anti-dsDNA without lupus nephritis), and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Severity of indomethacin-induced enteropathy in FcgRIIb-/- mice was higher than WT mice as demonstrated by survival analysis, intestinal injury (histology, immune-deposition, and intestinal cytokines), gut leakage (FITC-dextran assay and endotoxemia), serum cytokines, and lupus characteristics (anti-dsDNA, renal injury, and proteinuria). Prominent responses of FcgRIIb-/- macrophages toward lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to WT cells due to the expression of only activating-FcgRs without inhibitory-FcgRIIb were demonstrated. Extracellular flux analysis indicated the greater mitochondria activity (increased respiratory capacity and respiratory reserve) in FcgRIIb-/- macrophages with a concordant decrease in glycolysis activity when compared to WT cells. In conclusion, gut leakage-induced endotoxemia is more severe in indomethacin-administered FcgRIIb-/- mice than WT, possibly due to the enhanced indomethacin toxicity from lupus-induced intestinal immune-deposition. Due to a lack of inhibitory-FcgRIIb expression, mitochondrial function, and cytokine production of FcgRIIb-/- macrophages were more prominent than WT cells. Hence, lupus disease-activation from NSAIDs-enteropathy-induced gut leakage is possible.
33573089/Role of CgTpo4 in Polyamine and Antimicrobial Peptide Resistance: Determining Virulence in Candida glabrata Candida glabrata is an emerging fungal pathogen whose success depends on its ability to resist antifungal drugs but also to thrive against host defenses. In this study, the predicted multidrug transporter CgTpo4 (encoded by ORF CAGL0L10912g) is described as a new determinant of virulence in C. glabrata, using the infection model Galleria mellonella. The CgTPO4 gene was found to be required for the C. glabrata ability to kill G. mellonella. The transporter encoded by this gene is also necessary for antimicrobial peptide (AMP) resistance, specifically against histatin-5. Interestingly, G. mellonella's AMP expression was found to be strongly activated in response to C. glabrata infection, suggesting AMPs are a key antifungal defense. CgTpo4 was also found to be a plasma membrane exporter of polyamines, especially spermidine, suggesting that CgTpo4 is able to export polyamines and AMPs, thus conferring resistance to both stress agents. Altogether, this study presents the polyamine exporter CgTpo4 as a determinant of C. glabrata virulence, which acts by protecting the yeast cells from the overexpression of AMPs, deployed as a host defense mechanism.
33573189/Hyperglycemic Condition Causes Pro-Inflammatory and Permeability Alterations Associated with Monocyte Recruitment and Deregulated NFkappaB/PPARgamma Pathways on Cerebral Endothelial Cells: Evidence for Polyphenols Uptake and Protective Effect Hyperglycemia alters the function of cerebral endothelial cells from the blood-brain barrier, increasing the risk of cerebrovascular complications during diabetes. This study evaluated the protective effect of polyphenols on inflammatory and permeability markers on bEnd3 cerebral endothelial cells exposed to high glucose concentration. Results show that hyperglycemic condition increased nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) activity, deregulated the expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule (E-selectin) genes, raised MCP-1 secretion and elevated monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration. High glucose decreased occludin, claudin-5, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and zona occludens-2 (ZO-2) tight junctions production and altered the endothelial permeability. Characterized polyphenolic extracts from the French medicinal plants Antirhea borbonica, Ayapana triplinervis, Dodonaea viscosa and Terminalia bentzoe, and their major polyphenols quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic and gallic acids limited the pro-inflammatory and permeability alterations caused by high glucose. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist also attenuated these damages while PPARgamma antagonist aggravated them, suggesting PPARgamma protective action. Interestingly, polyphenols improved PPARgamma gene expression lowered by high glucose. Moreover, polyphenols were detected at the intracellular level or membrane-bound to cells, with evidence for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) efflux transporter role. Altogether, these findings emphasize the ability of polyphenols to protect cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition and their relevance for pharmacological strategies aiming to limit cerebrovascular disorders in diabetes.
33546591/Screening the elite chemotypes of Gloriosa superba L. in India for the production of anticancer colchicine: simultaneous microwave-assisted extraction and HPTLC studies Background Gloriosa superba L. (Colchicaceae) is a high-value medicinal plant indigenous to Africa and Southeast Asia. Its therapeutic benefits are well-established in traditional medicines including Ayurveda. It is well known for its natural bioactive compound colchicine which exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities i.e. rheumatism, gout and was also introduced into clinical practices. The increasing demand as well as its illegal harvesting has brought this valuable plant under threatened category. Methods The present investigation describes a microwave assisted extraction (MAE) strategy coupled with a densitometric-high performance thin layer chromatographic (HPTLC) methodology for the analysis of colchicine from 32 different populations of G. superba. A Box-Behnken statistical design (3 level factor) has been employed to optimize MAE, in which power of microwave, time of irradiation, aqueous ethanol and pH were used as independent variables whereas colchicine was used as the dependent variables. Chromatography was carried out on Silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates with toluene: methanol, 85:15 (v/v) being used as solvent system. Densitometric measurement was performed at lambda=254 nm following post-derivatization (10% methanolic sulphuric acid). Results Optimal conditions for extraction to obtain the maximum colchicine yield was found to be 7.51 mg g- 1 which was very close to be predicted response 7.48 mg g- 1 by maintaining microwave power (460 W), irradiation time (6.4 min), aqueous ethanol-30, pH -3. Colchicine content ranged between 2.12-7.58 mg g- 1 among 32 G. superba populations in which only three chemotypes viz. GS- 1, GS- 3, and GS- 2 collected from West Bengal and Sikkim, respectively exhibited maximum yield of colchicine. Conclusion Therefore, this newly developed optimized MAE coupled with HPTLC densitometry methodology not only quantifies colchicine in order to identify elite chemotypes of G. superba, but it also encourages in selecting high yielding populations of the plants for industrial use and economic boost for the farmers. This validated, simple and reproducible HPTLC protocol is being used for the first time to estimate colchicine from natural populations of G. superba obtained from 32 different geographical regions of India.

33549042/Inhibitory effect of sodium butyrate on colorectal cancer cells and construction of the related molecular network Background Sodium butyrate (NaB) is produced through the fermentation of dietary fiber that is not absorbed and digested by the small intestine. Purpose Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of NaB on the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cells and their potential underlying molecular mechanism(s). Methods The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and EdU assay were used to detect cell proliferation ability, flow cytometry was used to investigate the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and the scratch-wound healing and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion, respectively. The human CRC genome information for tissues and CRC cells treated with NaB obtained from the NCBI GEO database was reannotated and used for differential RNA analysis. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the hub genes was constructed using the Cytoscape software. Targeted miRNAs were predicted based on the lnCeDB database, and a ceRNA network was constructed using the Cytoscape software. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze patient prognosis using the clinical information and exon-seq data for CRC obtained from the Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose platform. Results NaB decreased the proliferation ability of CRC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The number of apoptotic CRC cells increased with the increase in NaB concentrations, and NaB induced a G1 phase block in CRC cells. Moreover, NaB suppressed the migratory and invasive capabilities of CRC cells. There were 666 differentially expressed mRNAs and 30 differentially expressed lncRNAs involved in the CRC inhibition by NaB. The PPI network and ceRNA network were constructed based on the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. Three differentially expressed mRNAs, including HMGA2, LOXL2, and ST7, were significantly correlated with the prognosis of CRC. Conclusion NaB induces the apoptosis and inhibition of CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by modulating complex molecular networks. RNA prediction and molecular network construction need to be the focus of further research in this direction.
33549107/pH-responsive delivery vehicle based on RGD-modified polydopamine-paclitaxel-loaded poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) nanoparticles for targeted therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma A limitation of current anticancer nanocarriers is the contradiction between multiple functions and favorable biocompatibility. Thus, we aimed to develop a compatible drug delivery system loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. A basic backbone, PTX-loaded poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) PHBV nanoparticle (PHBV-PTX-NPs), was prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation. As a gatekeeper, the pH-sensitive coating was formed by self-polymerization of dopamine (PDA). The HCC-targeted arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide and PDA-coated nanoparticles (NPs) were combined through the Michael addition. Subsequently, the physicochemical properties of RGD-PDA-PHBV-PTX-NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering-autosizer, transmission electron microscope, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and X-ray spectroscopy. As expected, the RGD-PDA-PHBV-PTX-NPs showed robust anticancer efficacy in a xenograft mouse model. More importantly, they exhibited lower toxicity than PTX to normal hepatocytes and mouse in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that the RGD-PDA-PHBV-PTX-NPs are potentially beneficial for easing conflict between multifunction and biocompatible characters of nanocarriers. 
33546719/Effect of 150 kHz electromagnetic radiation on the development of polycystic ovaries induced by estradiol Valerate in Sprague Dawley rats Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common complex endocrine disorder affecting approximately 2-20% of reproductive aged females. Tumour Treating Fields (100-300 kHz) is a recent innovative, non-invasive therapeutic approach to cancer therapy. This frequency as an alternative therapy for the management of polycystic ovaries has not yet been explored. Objectives To explore the effect of full-body exposure of 150 kHz Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR), on the development of polycystic ovaries in an estradiol valerate-induced PCO rat model. Method Twenty-one female adult rats were divided into three groups (n = 7 each): control, Estradiol Valerate (EV) and EV + EMR groups. The EV + EMR group was subjected to full body exposure at 150 kHz EMR continuously for eight consecutive weeks. Estradiol valerate was administered orally to induce polycystic ovaries in EV and EV + EMR groups. Body and ovarian weights were recorded and analysed. The regularity of the estrous cycle was assessed in all three groups. The histological study of ovarian tissue was carried out by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The serum concentration levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and testosterone were measured using the ELISA method. Results The body and ovary weights did not differ significantly between the EV and EV + EMR groups. The estrous cycle was found to be irregular in both the EV and EV + EMR groups. Ovarian histology revealed near normal morphology with little or no degenerative and morphological changes in developing follicles in the exposed group. Histometrical analysis showed an increased number of developing follicles and a significant reduction in the number and size of follicular cysts (p < 0.05) in the EV + EMR group. Hormonal analysis revealed no significant difference in the testosterone and FSH levels between the EV + EMR and EV groups. However, the LH, LH/FSH ratio decreased significantly in the EV + EMR group compares to the EV group. Conclusion The 150 kHz EMR appear to have little or no degenerative and morphological changes in the developing follicles, an increased number of typical developing follicles and a significant reduction in the number and size of the follicular cysts (p < 0.05).
33572516/Transport Characteristics of CJMAED  Homogeneous Anion Exchange Membranes in Sodium Chloride and Sodium Sulfate Solutions The interplay between the ion exchange capacity, water content and concentration dependences of conductivity, diffusion permeability, and counterion transport numbers (counterion permselectivity) of CJMA-3, CJMA-6 and CJMA-7 (Hefei Chemjoy Polymer Materials Co. Ltd., China) anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) is analyzed using the application of the microheterogeneous model to experimental data. The structure-properties relationship for these membranes is examined when they are bathed by NaCl and Na2SO4 solutions. These results are compared with the characteristics of the well-studied homogenous Neosepta AMX (ASTOM Corporation, Japan) and heterogeneous AMH-PES (Mega a.s., Czech Republic) anion-exchange membranes. It is found that the CJMA-6 membrane has the highest counterion permselectivity (chlorides, sulfates) among the CJMAED series membranes, very close to that of the AMX membrane. The CJMA-3 membrane has the transport characteristics close to the AMH-PES membrane. The CJMA-7 membrane has the lowest exchange capacity and the highest volume fraction of the intergel spaces filled with an equilibrium electroneutral solution. These properties predetermine the lowest counterion transport number in CJMA-7 among other investigated AEMs, which nevertheless does not fall below 0.87 even in 1.0 eq L-1 solutions of NaCl or Na2SO4. One of the reasons for the decrease in the permselectivity of CJMAED membranes is the extended macropores, which are localized at the ion-exchange material/reinforcing cloth boundaries. In relatively concentrated solutions, the electric current prefers to pass through these well-conductive but nonselective macropores rather than the highly selective but low-conductive elements of the gel phase. It is shown that the counterion permselectivity of the CJMA-7 membrane can be significantly improved by coating its surface with a dense homogeneous ion-exchange film.
33572597/Loganin Attenuates the Severity of Acute Kidney Injury Induced by Cisplatin through the Inhibition of ERK Activation in Mice Cisplatin is the most widely used chemotherapeutic agent. However, it often causes nephrotoxicity, which results in acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, we urgently need a drug that can reduce the nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. Loganin is a major iridoid glycoside isolated from Corni fructus that has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in various pathological models. However, the renal protective activity of loganin remains unclear. In this study, to examine the protective effect of loganin on cisplatin-induced AKI, male C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with loganin (1, 10, and 20 mg/kg) 1 h before intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (10 mg/kg) and sacrificed at three days after the injection. The administration of loganin inhibited the elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA) in serum, which are used as biomarkers of AKI. Moreover, histological kidney injury, proximal tubule damages, and renal cell death, such as apoptosis and ferroptosis, were reduced by loganin treatment. Also, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, reduced by loganin treatment. Furthermore, loganin deactivated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 during AKI. Taken together, our results suggest that loganin may attenuate cisplatin-induced AKI through the inhibition of ERK1/2.
33572690/Influence of Antiplatelet Agents on the Lipid Composition of Platelet Plasma Membrane: A Lipidomics Approach with Ticagrelor and Its Active Metabolite Lipids contained in the plasma membrane of platelets play an important role in platelet function. Modifications in the lipid composition can fluidify or rigidify the environment around embedded receptors, in order to facilitate the access of the receptor by the drug. However, data concerning the lipid composition of platelet plasma membrane need to be updated. In addition, data on the impact of drugs on plasma membrane composition, in particular antiplatelet agents, remain sparse. After isolation of platelet plasma membrane, we assessed, using lipidomics, the effect of ticagrelor, a P2Y12 antagonist, and its active metabolite on the lipid composition of these plasma membranes. We describe the exact lipid composition of plasma membrane, including all sub-species. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite significantly increased cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine ether with short saturated acyl chains 16:0/16:0, and decreased phosphatidylcholine, suggesting overall rigidification of the membrane. Furthermore, ticagrelor and its active metabolite decreased some arachidonylated plasmalogens, suggesting a decrease in availability of arachidonic acid from the membrane phospholipids for synthesis of biologically active mediators. To conclude, ticagrelor and its active metabolite seem to influence the lipid environment of receptors embedded in the lipid bilayer and modify the behavior of the plasma membrane.
33572582/Combined Metabolite and Transcriptome Profiling Reveals the Norisoprenoid Responses in Grape Berries to Abscisic Acid and Synthetic Auxin The abscisic acid (ABA) increase and auxin decline are both indicators of ripening initiation in grape berry, and norisoprenoid accumulation also starts at around the onset of ripening. However, the relationship between ABA, auxin, and norisoprenoids remains largely unknown, especially at the transcriptome level. To investigate the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the ABA and synthetic auxin 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) on norisoprenoid production, we performed time-series GC-MS and RNA-seq analyses on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon grape berries from pre-veraison to ripening. Higher levels of free norisoprenoids were found in ABA-treated mature berries in two consecutive seasons, and both free and total norisoprenoids were significantly increased by NAA in one season. The expression pattern of known norisoprenoid-associated genes in all samples and the up-regulation of specific alternative splicing isoforms of VviDXS and VviCRTISO in NAA-treated berries were predicted to contribute to the norisoprenoid accumulation in ABA and NAA-treated berries. Combined weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis suggested that VviGATA26, and the previously identified switch genes of myb RADIALIS (VIT_207s0005g02730) and MAD-box (VIT_213s0158g00100) could be potential regulators of norisoprenoid accumulation. The positive effects of ABA on free norisoprenoids and NAA on total norisoprenoid accumulation were revealed in the commercially ripening berries. Since the endogenous ABA and auxin are sensitive to environmental factors, this finding provides new insights to develop viticultural practices for managing norisoprenoids in vineyards in response to changing climates.
33535437/A Bioassay Using a Pentadecanal Derivative to Measure S1P Lyase Activity Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a unique lipid ligand binding to S1P receptors to transduce various cell survival or proliferation signals via small G proteins. S1P lyase (S1PL) is the specific enzyme that degrades S1P to phosphoethanolamine and (2E)-hexadecenal and therefore regulates S1P levels. S1PL also degrades dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (Sa1P), with a higher affinity to produce hexadecanal. Here, we developed a newly designed assay using a C17-Sa1P substrate that degrades into pentadecanal and phosphoethanolamine. For higher sensitivity in pentadecanal analysis, we developed a quantitative protocol as well as a 5,5-dimethyl cyclohexanedione (5,5-dimethyl CHD) derivatization method. The derivatization conditions were optimized for the reaction time, temperature, and concentrations of the 5,5-dimethyl CHD reagent, acetic acid, and ammonium acetate. The S1PL reaction in the cell lysate after spiking 20 microM of C17-Sa1P for 20 min was linear to the total protein concentrations of 50 microg. The S1PL levels (4 pmol/mg/min) were readily detected in this HPLC with fluorescence detection (lambdaex = 366 nm, lambdaem = 455 nm). The S1PL-catalyzed reaction was linear over 30 min and yielded a Km value of 2.68 muM for C17-Sa1P. This new method was validated to measure the S1PL activity of mouse embryonal carcinoma cell lines of the standard cell (F9-0), S1PL knockdown cells (F9-2), and S1PL-overexpressed cells (F9-4). Furthermore, we treated F9-4 cells with different S1PL inhibitors such as FTY720, 4-deoxypyridoxine (DOP), and the deletion of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P), an essential cofactor for S1PL activity, and observed a significant decrease in pentadecanal relative to the untreated cells. In conclusion, we developed a highly sensitive S1PL assay using a C17-Sa1P substrate for pentadecanal quantification for application in the characterization of S1PL activity in vitro.
33535482/Graphene-Doped Poly (Methyl-Methacrylate) (Pmma) Implants: A Micro-CT and Histomorphometrical Study in Rabbits Background:the graphene-doping procedure represents a useful procedure to improve the mechanical, physical and biological response of several Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-derived polymers and biomaterials for dental applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate osseointegration of Graphene doped Poly(methyl methacrylate) (GD-PMMA) compared with PMMA as potential materials for dental implant devices. Methods:eighteen adult New Zealand white male rabbits with a mean weight of approx. 3000 g were used in this research. A total of eighteen implants of 3.5 mm diameter and 11 mm length in GD-PMMA and eighteen implants in PMMA were used. The implants were placed into the articular femoral knee joint. The animals were sacrificed after 15, 30 and 60 days and the specimens were evaluated by microCT and histomorphometry. Results:microscopically, all 36 implants, 18 in PMMA and 18 in DG-PMMA were well-integrated into the bone. The implants were in contact with cortical bone along the upper threads, while the lower threads were in contact with either newly formed bone or with marrow spaces. The histomorphometry and microCT evaluation showed that the GP-PMMA and PMMA implants were well osseointegrated and the bone was in direct contact with large portions of the implant surfaces, including the space in the medullary canal. Conclusions:in conclusion, the results suggest that GD-PMMA titanium surfaces enhance osseointegration in rabbit femurs. This encourages further research to obtain GD-PMMA with a greater radiopacity. Also, further in vitro and vivo animal studies are necessary to evaluate a potential clinical usage for dental implant applications.
33535681/Intricacies of GABAA Receptor Function: The Critical Role of the beta3 Subunit in Norm and Pathology Neuronal intracellular chloride ([Cl-]i) is a key determinant in gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA)ergic signaling. gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) mediate both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission, as the passive fluxes of Cl- and HCO3- via pores can be reversed by changes in the transmembrane concentration gradient of Cl-. The cation-chloride co-transporters (CCCs) are the primary systems for maintaining [Cl-]i homeostasis. However, despite extensive electrophysiological data obtained in vitro that are supported by a wide range of molecular biological studies on the expression patterns and properties of CCCs, the presence of ontogenetic changes in [Cl-]i:along with the consequent shift in GABA reversal potential:remain a subject of debate. Recent studies showed that the beta3 subunit possesses properties of the P-type ATPase that participates in the ATP-consuming movement of Cl- via the receptor. Moreover, row studies have demonstrated that the beta3 subunit is a key player in GABAAR performance and in the appearance of serious neurological disorders. In this review, we discuss the properties and driving forces of CCCs and Cl-, HCO3-ATPase in the maintenance of [Cl-]i homeostasis after changes in upcoming GABAAR function. Moreover, we discuss the contribution of the beta3 subunit in the manifestation of epilepsy, autism, and other syndromes.
33535672/Combination of Entecavir or Tenofovir with Pegylated Interferon-alpha for Long-Term Reduction in Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Levels: Simultaneous, Sequential, or Add-on Combination Therapy Seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) ("functional cure") is the optimal endpoint of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Currently available anti-HBV therapy includes nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs) and peginterferon-alpha (Peg-IFNalpha). Combination of NAs and Peg-IFNalpha, each with different mechanisms of action, is an attractive approach for treating chronic HBV infection. In earlier studies, compared with monotherapy using IFNalpha, combination therapy showed greater on-treatment HBV DNA suppression but no difference in the sustained response. However, responses to the combination of non-pegylated IFNalpha with lamivudine or adefovir were not assessed based on HBsAg quantification but were defined by normal alanine aminotransferase levels, testing negative for hepatitis B e-antigen, and low HBV DNA load over a short term. Here, we reviewed previous reports regarding the effects of combination therapy of entecavir or tenofovir with Peg-IFNalpha, focusing on long-term reduction in HBsAg levels. Regimens of combination therapy were classified into "simultaneous" combination ("de novo" strategy); "sequential" combination, which involved starting with one therapy followed by the other ("switch-to" strategy); "add-on" combination, which involved adding Peg-IFNalpha to an ongoing NAs. Some studies have shown promising results, but there is no robust evidence that combination therapy is superior to monotherapy. Large studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of combination therapies to increase the rates of HBsAg seroclearance over the long term.
33535619/Resveratrol Supplementation Attenuates Cognitive and Molecular Alterations under Maternal High-Fat Diet Intake: Epigenetic Inheritance over Generations Environmental factors such as maternal high-fat diet (HFD) intake can increase the risk of age-related cognitive decline in adult offspring. Epigenetic mechanisms are a possible link between diet effect and neurodegeneration across generations. Here, we found a significant decrease in triglyceride levels in a high-fat diet with resveratrol (RSV) HFD + RSV group and the offspring. Firstly, we obtained better cognitive performance in HFD+RSV groups and their offspring. Molecularly, a significant increase in DNA methylation (5-mC) levels, as well as increased gene expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Dnmt3a in HFD + RSV F1 group, were found. Furthermore, a significant increase of N6-Methyladenosine methylation (m6A) levels in HFD+RSV F1, as well as changes in gene expression of its enzymes Methyltransferase like 3 (Mettl3) and FTO alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (Fto) were found. Moreover, we found a decrease in gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as Interleukin 1beta (Il1-beta), Interleukin 6 (Il-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl-10), the pro-inflammatory factors monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (Mcp-1) and Tumor growth factor-beta1 (Tgf-beta1) in HFD+RSV and HFD+RSV F1 groups. Moreover, there was increased gene expression of neurotrophins such as Neural growth factor (Ngf), Neurotrophin-3 (Nt3), and its receptors Tropomyosin receptor kinase TrkA and TrkB. Likewise, an increase in protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phospho-protein kinase B (p-Akt) in HFD+RSV F1 was found. These results suggest that maternal RSV supplementation under HFD intake prevents cognitive decline in senescence-accelerated mice prone 8 (SAMP8) adult offspring, promoting a reduction in triglycerides and leptin plasma levels, changes in the pro-inflammatory profile, and restoring the epigenetic landscape as well as synaptic plasticity.
33535646/Expression Level of Mature miR172 in Wild Type and StSUT4-Silenced Plants of Solanum tuberosum Is Sucrose-Dependent In potato plants, the phloem-mobile miR172 is involved in the sugar-dependent transmission of flower and tuber inducing signal transduction pathways and a clear link between solute transport and the induction of flowering and tuberization was demonstrated. The sucrose transporter StSUT4 seems to play an important role in the photoperiod-dependent triggering of both developmental processes, flowering and tuberization, and the phenotype of StSUT4-inhibited potato plants is reminiscent to miR172 overexpressing plants. The first aim of this study was the determination of the level of miR172 in sink and source leaves of StSUT4-silenced as well as StSUT4-overexpressing plants in comparison to Solanum tuberosum ssp. Andigena wild type plants. The second aim was to investigate the effect of sugars on the level of miRNA172 in whole cut leaves, as well as in whole in vitro plantlets that were supplemented with exogenous sugars. Experiments clearly show a sucrose-dependent induction of the level of mature miR172 in short time as well as long time experiments. A sucrose-dependent accumulation of miR172 was also measured in mature leaves of StSUT4-silenced plants where sucrose export is delayed and sucrose accumulates at the end of the light period.
33535610/Phosphatidic Acid Stimulates Myoblast Proliferation through Interaction with LPA1 and LPA2 Receptors Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a bioactive phospholipid capable of regulating key biological functions, including neutrophil respiratory burst, chemotaxis, or cell growth and differentiation. However, the mechanisms whereby PA exerts these actions are not completely understood. In this work, we show that PA stimulates myoblast proliferation, as determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA and by staining the cells with crystal violet. PA induced the rapid phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, and pretreatment of the cells with specific small interferin RNA (siRNA) to silence the genes encoding these kinases, or with selective pharmacologic inhibitors, blocked PA-stimulated myoblast proliferation. The mitogenic effects of PA were abolished by the preincubation of the myoblasts with pertussis toxin, a Gi protein inhibitor, suggesting the implication of Gi protein-coupled receptors in this action. Although some of the effects of PA have been associated with its possible conversion to lysoPA (LPA), treatment of the myoblasts with PA for up to 60 min did not produce any significant amount of LPA in these cells. Of interest, pharmacological blockade of the LPA receptors 1 and 2, or specific siRNA to silence the genes encoding these receptors, abolished PA-stimulated myoblast proliferation. Moreover, PA was able to compete with LPA for binding to LPA receptors, suggesting that PA can act as a ligand of LPA receptors. It can be concluded that PA stimulates myoblast proliferation through interaction with LPA1 and LPA2 receptors and the subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1-2 pathways, independently of LPA formation.
33535680/Effects of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone on Lipid Metabolism and Anti-Oxidative Capacity in a High-Fat-Diet Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease Chick Model Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and its interaction with many metabolic pathways raises global public health concerns. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ, provided by PQQ.Na2) on MAFLD in a chick model and primary chicken hepatocytes with a focus on lipid metabolism, anti-oxidative capacity, and mitochondrial biogenesis. The MAFLD chick model was established on laying hens by feeding them a high-energy low-protein (HELP) diet. Primary hepatocytes isolated from the liver of laying hens were induced for steatosis by free fatty acids (FFA) and for oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the MAFLD chick model, the dietary supplementation of PQQ conspicuously ameliorated the negative effects of the HELP diet on liver biological functions, suppressed the progression of MAFLD mainly through enhanced lipid metabolism and protection of liver from oxidative injury. In the steatosis and oxidative stress cell models, PQQ functions in the improvement of the lipid metabolism and hepatocytes tolerance to fatty degradation and oxidative damage by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and then increasing the anti-oxidative activity and anti-apoptosis capacity. At both the cellular and individual levels, PQQ was demonstrated to exert protective effects of hepatocyte and liver from fat accumulation through the improvement of mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance of redox homeostasis. The key findings of the present study provide an in-depth knowledge on the ameliorative effects of PQQ on the progression of fatty liver and its mechanism of action, thus providing a theoretical basis for the application of PQQ, as an effective nutrient, into the prevention of MAFLD.
33564685/Forskolin Protected against Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Cardiomyopathy via Inhibition of Oxidative Stress and Cardiac Fibrosis in Mice Background  Diabetic cardiomyopathy is one of the cardiac complications in diabetes patients, eventually resulting in heart failure and increasing morbidity and mortality. Oxidative stress is a critical pathological feature in diabetic hearts, contributing to the development of DCM. Forskolin (FSK) was shown to reduce oxidative stress. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of FSK on diabetic hearts and the relevant molecular mechanisms.  Methods  Streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetes in mice was treated with FSK through intraperitoneal injection. Cardiac functions were evaluated by echocardiography. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome staining was employed to determine heart morphological changes and cardiac fibrosis, respectively. Cardiac fibrosis-related markers were detected by western blot. Superoxide dismutase activity, reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio, and malondialdehyde concentration in left ventricles were determined using respective commercial kits.  Results  Abnormal cardiac diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis were observed in diabetic hearts. FSK treatment significantly improved the cardiac diastolic function and attenuated the abnormal morphological change in diabetic hearts. Moreover, FSK treatment in diabetic mice decreased the expression of fibronectin, collagen I, TGF-beta, and alpha-SMA and reduced myocardial fibrosis. Furthermore, we observed that FSK significantly blocked oxidative stress in diabetic hearts.  Conclusions  Our study demonstrates that FSK protects against the development of DCM in STZ-induced diabetes in mice. Our study suggests that FSK might be a potential target for drug development in treating DCM.
33564679/Tantalum Particles Induced Cytotoxic and Inflammatory Effects in Human Monocytes The aim of this study is to evaluate the biological safety of tantalum (Ta) particles and to further explore the effects of Ta particles on human monocyte toxicity and inflammatory cytokine expression. Human monocyte leukemia (THP-1) cells were cultured with Ta and hydroxyapatite (HA) particles. Cell counting kit-8 method was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Ta and HA particles. The apoptosis effects were evaluated by flow cytometry, and the protein expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were evaluated by ELISA. The protein levels of inflammation-related signaling pathways including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) were detected by western blotting. The cytotoxicity test showed that the toxicity level of Ta in vitro was grade l, which is within the clinically acceptable range. Compared with the HA control, Ta had no significant effect on THP-1 cell apoptosis, IL-6, and TNF-alpha release. The phosphorylated levels of NF-kappaB and ERK at 3 h in the Ta group were lower than those in the HA and control groups (P < 0.001 both). These results reveal Ta particles behave good biosafety properties and provide some new insights for the future clinical use of Ta.
33557849/ Direct RBS Engineering of the biosynthetic gene cluster for efficient productivity of violaceins in E. coli Background Violaceins have attracted much attention as potential targets used in medicines, food additives, insecticides, cosmetics and textiles, but low productivity was the key factor to limit their large-scale applications. This work put forward a direct RBS engineering strategy to engineer the violacein biosynthetic gene cluster cloned from Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12,472 to efficiently improve the fermentation titers. Results Through four-rounds of engineering of the native RBSs within the violaceins biosynthetic operon vioABCDE, this work apparently broke through the rate-limiting steps of intermediates conversion, resulting in 2.41-fold improvement of violaceins production compared to the titers of the starting strain Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Vio12472). Furthermore, by optimizing the batch-fermentation parameters including temperature, concentration of IPTG inducer and fermentation time, the maximum yield of violaceins from (BCDE)m (tnaA-) reached 3269.7 microM at 2 mM tryptophan in the medium. Interestingly, rather than previous reported low temperature (20 C), we for the first time found the RBS engineered Escherichia coli strain (BCDE)m worked better at higher temperature (30 C and 37 C), leading to a higher-level production of violaceins. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct RBS engineering strategy is used for the biosynthesis of natural products, having the potential for a greater improvement of the product yields within tryptophan hyperproducers and simultaneously avoiding the costly low temperature cultivation for large-scale industrial production of violaciens. This direct RBS engineering strategy could also be easily and helpfully used in engineering the native RBSs of other larger and value-added natural product biosynthetic gene clusters by widely used site-specific mutagenesis methods represented by inverse PCR or CRISPR-Cas9 techniques to increase their fermentation titers in the future.
33557832/Production of succinate by engineered strains of Synechocystis PCC 6803 overexpressing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and a glyoxylate shunt Background Cyanobacteria are promising hosts for the production of various industrially important compounds such as succinate. This study focuses on introduction of the glyoxylate shunt, which is naturally present in only a few cyanobacteria, into Synechocystis PCC 6803. In order to test its impact on cell metabolism, engineered strains were evaluated for succinate accumulation under conditions of light, darkness and anoxic darkness. Each condition was complemented by treatments with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone, an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase enzyme, and acetate, both in nitrogen replete and deplete medium. Results We were able to introduce genes encoding the glyoxylate shunt, aceA and aceB, encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase respectively, into a strain of Synechocystis PCC 6803 engineered to overexpress phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Our results show that complete expression of the glyoxylate shunt results in higher extracellular succinate accumulation compared to the wild type control strain after incubation of cells in darkness and anoxic darkness in the presence of nitrate. Addition of the inhibitor 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone increased succinate titers in all the conditions tested when nitrate was available. Addition of acetate in the presence of the inhibitor further increased the succinate accumulation, resulting in high levels when phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was overexpressed, compared to control strain. However, the highest succinate titer was obtained after dark incubation of an engineered strain with a partial glyoxylate shunt overexpressing isocitrate lyase in addition to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, with only 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone supplementation to the medium. Conclusions Heterologous expression of the glyoxylate shunt with its central link to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) for acetate assimilation provides insight on the coordination of the carbon metabolism in the cell. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase plays an important role in directing carbon flux towards the TCA cycle.
33561150/Transcriptome analyses reveal the utilization of nitrogen sources and related metabolic mechanisms of Sporosarcina pasteurii In recent years, Sporosarcina pasteurii (S. pasteurii) has become one of the most popular bacteria in microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Various applications have been developed based on the efficient urease that can induce the precipitation of calcium carbonate. However, the metabolic mechanism related to biomineralization of S. pasteurii has not been clearly elucidated. The process of bacterial culture and biomineralization consumes a large amount of urea or ammonium salts, which are usually used as agricultural fertilizers, not to mention probable environmental pollutions caused by the excessive use of these raw materials. Therefore, it is urgent to reveal the mechanism of nitrogen utilization and metabolism of S. pasteurii. In this paper, we compared the growth and gene expression of S. pasteurii under three different culture conditions through transcriptome analyses. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that both ammonium and urea were direct nitrogen sources of S. pasteurii, and the bacteria could not grow normally in the absence of ammonium or urea. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to reveal the nitrogen utilization mechanism of S. pasteurii through transcriptome methods. Furthermore, the presence of ammonium might promote the synthesis of intracellular ATP and enhance the motility of the bacteria. There should be an ATP synthesis mechanism associated with urea hydrolysis catalyzed by urease in S. pasteurii.
33561155/Bisphenol-C is the strongest bifunctional ERalpha-agonist and ERbeta-antagonist due to magnified halogen bonding We reported that bisphenol AF (BPAF) works as an agonist for estrogen receptor (ER) ERalpha but as an antagonist for ERbeta. Similar results were observed for bisphenol E analogs (BPE-X) such as BPE-F, BPE-Cl, and BPE-Br, each consisting of a series of a tri-halogenated methyl group CX3 in the central alkyl moiety. It was demonstrated that the electrostatic halogen bond based on the dispersion force of halogen atoms is a major driving force in the activities of bifunctional ERalpha-agonist and ERbeta-antagonist. Since the chlorine atoms present in bisphenol C (BPC) exist in a pi-pi conjugated system due to the presence of an adjacent C = C double bond, we intended to prove that BPC is also a bifunctional ERalpha-agonist and ERbeta-antagonist exhibiting greatly enhanced agonist/antagonist activities. BPC was evaluated for its ability to activate ERalpha and ERbeta in the luciferase reporter gene assay using HeLa cells. With high receptor-binding ability to both ERs, BPC was found to be fully active for ERalpha but inactive for ERbeta. BPC's definite antagonist activity in ERbeta was revealed by its inhibitory activity against 17beta-estradiol. Thus, BPC is a bifunctional ERalpha-agonist and ERbeta-antagonist. These agonist/antagonist activities were discovered to be extremely high among series of halogen-containing bisphenol compounds. This comparative structure-activity study revealed that the ascending order of ERalpha-agonist and ERbeta-antagonist activities was BPE-F << BPE-Cl   BPAF < BPE-Br << BPC. The highly intensified receptor interaction of BPC is attributable to the presence of an n-pi-pi-n conjugation system mediated through the >C = CCl2 double bond.
33561145/Mercury in the human thyroid gland: Potential implications for thyroid cancer, autoimmune thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism Objective Mercury and other toxic metals have been suggested to be involved in thyroid disorders, but the distribution and prevalence of mercury in the human thyroid gland is not known. We therefore used two elemental bio-imaging techniques to look at the distribution of mercury and other toxic metals in the thyroid glands of people over a wide range of ages. Materials and methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded thyroid tissue blocks were obtained from 115 people aged 1-104 years old, with varied clinicopathological conditions, who had thyroid samples removed during forensic/coronial autopsies. Seven-micron sections from these tissue blocks were used to detect intracellular inorganic mercury using autometallography. The presence of mercury was confirmed using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry which can detect multiple elements. Results Mercury was found on autometallography in the thyroid follicular cells of 4% of people aged 1-29 years, 9% aged 30-59 years, and 38% aged 60-104 years. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of mercury in samples staining with autometallography, and detected cadmium, lead, iron, nickel and silver in selected samples. Conclusions The proportion of people with mercury in their thyroid follicular cells increases with age, until it is present in over one-third of people aged 60 years and over. Other toxic metals in thyroid cells could enhance mercury toxicity. Mercury can trigger genotoxicity, autoimmune reactions, and oxidative damage, which raises the possibility that mercury could play a role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancers, autoimmune thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism.
33563317/Prospective pathway signaling and prognostic values of MicroRNA-9 in ovarian cancer based on gene expression omnibus (GEO): a bioinformatics analysis Objective MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the development of ovarian cancer (OC). The aim of this study to investigate the prognostic value and potential signaling pathways of hsa-miR-9-5p (miR-9) in OC through literature review and bioinformatics methods. Methods The expression of miR-9 in OC was assessed using the public datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. And a literature review was also performed to investigate the correlation between miR-9 expression and the OC prognosis. Two mRNA datasets (GSE18520 and GSE36668) of OC tissues and normal ovarian tissues (NOTs) were downloaded from GEO to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The target genes of hsa-miR-9-5p (TG-miR-9-5p) were predicted using miRWALK3.0 and TargetScan. Then the gene overlaps between DEGs in OC and the predicted TG-miR-9-5p were confirmed using a Venn diagram. After that, overlapping genes were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape, and the impact of hub genes on OC prognosis was analyzed. Results It was found that OC patients with miR-9 low expression had poor prognosis. A total of 107 DEGs related to both OC and miR-9 were identified. Dozens of DEGs were enriched in developmental process, extracellular matrix structural constituent, cell junction, axon guidance. In the PPI network analysis, 5 of the top 10 hub genes was significantly associated with decreased overall survival of OC patients, namely FBN1 (HR = 1.64, P < 0.05), PRRX1 (HR = 1.76, P < 0.05), SMC2 (HR = 1.22, P < 0.05), SMC4 (HR = 1.31, P < 0.05), and VCAN (HR = 1.48, P < 0.05). Conclusion Low expression of miR-9 indicates poor prognosis of OC patients. MiR-9 plays a crucial role in the biological process of OC by binding to target genes, thus affecting the prognosis of patients.
33563314/Propofol suppresses cell viability, cell cycle progression and motility and induces cell apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells through suppressing MEK/ERK signaling via targeting circVPS13C/miR-145 axis Background Propofol is a kind of common intravenous anaesthetic agent that plays an anti-tumor role in a variety of cancers, including ovarian cancer. However, the working mechanism of Propofol in ovarian cancer needs further exploration. Methods The viability and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells were assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and transwell assays. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the cell cycle and apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the abundance of circular RNA vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog C (circVPS13C) and microRNA-145 (miR-145). The target relationship between miR-145 and circVPS13C was predicted by circinteractome database and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and RNA-pull down assay. Western blot assay was used to detect the levels of phosphorylated extracellular regulated MAP kinase (p-ERK), ERK, p-MAP kinse-ERK kinase (p-MEK) and MEK, in ovarian cancer cells. Results Propofol treatment suppressed the viability, cell cycle and motility and elevated the apoptosis rate of ovarian cancer cells. Propofol up-regulated miR-145 in a dose-dependent manner. Propofol exerted an anti-tumor role partly through up-regulating miR-145. MiR-145 was a direct target of circVPS13C. Propofol suppressed the progression of ovarian cancer through up-regulating miR-145 via suppressing circVPS13C. Propofol functioned through circVPS13C/miR-145/MEK/ERK signaling in ovarian cancer cells. Conclusion Propofol suppressed the proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion and induced the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells through circVPS13C/miR-145/MEK/ERK signaling in vitro.
33566869/Effects of electrical biostimulation and silver ions on porcine fibroblast cells The medical applications of electrical biostimulation and silver ions have been evaluated in laboratory experiments and clinical studies for more than two decades. Their effects on preventing infection and promoting wound healing have been described. However, little is known about the role of electrical biostimulation and/or silver ion on changes in cellular transcriptome dynamics. To our knowledge, few studies have been conducted to investigate the potential of electrical biostimulation and silver ions in cell reprogramming. Besides, it is essential to assess any possible adverse effects or potential benefits of the silver ions on mammalian cells to address its safety concerns and to improve silver medical products. In this study, we investigated transcriptomic changes in porcine fibroblast cells in response to electrical biostimulation in the presence of silver ions. Exposed cells presented distinct morphological changes after treatment, which was mainly due to the exposure of silver ions rather than the electrical current itself. Gene expression analyses suggested that electrical biostimulation and silver ions did not increase the expression of pluripotency genes. Interestingly, a set of genes related to cellular metabolic processes were differentially expressed after cells were exposed to electrically generated silver ions for 21 hours. We found that 2.00 mg/L of electrically generated silver ion caused an increase of ATP generation and an increase of the total pool of NAD+ and NADH, while ROS production did not change. Aside from toxic effects, the results reported herein demonstrate the alternative effects of silver ions on mammalian cells, especially an oxidative phosphorylation burst. To our knowledge, this response of mammalian cells to silver ions has not been described previously. Although the function of this burst is not understood, it may lead to alterations in cellular activities such as metabolic remodeling and cell reprogramming, and/or serve an as-yet unknown function in neutralization or detoxification of the silver ions within the cells.
33253604/Effects of wogonoside on the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in mice with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Abstract Context  Wogonoside has many pharmacological activities, but whether it has a protective effect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been reported. Objective  This study investigates the protective effect of wogonoside against NAFLD in mice and its potential mechanism. Materials and methods  C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, NAFLD group and low-, medium- and high-dose wogonoside groups (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively) (n= 12). Mice in the control group were fed with the standard diet, and those in NAFLD group and low-, medium- and high-dose wogonoside groups were fed with a high-fat diet. The different doses of wogonoside were administered by gavage once a day for 12 weeks. Results  Compared with those in NAFLD group, the liver mass, liver index and the LDL, TG, TC, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MDA and NF-kappaB p65 levels were decreased, and the SOD and GSH-Px activities, and HDL, IkappaBalpha, Nrf2 and HO-1 contents were increased in wogonoside groups. Compared with those in the NAFLD group, wogonoside (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) reduced AST (132.21 +- 14.62, 115.70 +- 11.32 and 77.94 +- 8.86 vs. 202.35 +- 19.58 U/L) and ALT (104.37 +- 11.92, 97.53 +- 10.12 and 56.74 +- 6.33 vs. 154.66 +- 14.23 U/L) activities in the serum. Discussion and conclusions  Wogonoside has a protective effect against NAFLD in mice, which may be related to its anti-inflammation and inhibition of oxidative stress, suggesting that wogonoside may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of NAFLD.
33623633/Calcitriol Supplementation Ameliorates Microvascular Endothelial Dysfunction in Vitamin D-Deficient Diabetic Rats by Upregulating the Vascular eNOS Protein Expression and Reducing Oxidative Stress Diabetes mellitus contributes to macro- and microvascular complications, leading to adverse cardiovascular events. This study examined the effects of vitamin D deficiency on the vascular function and tissue oxidative status in the microcirculation of diabetic rats and to determine whether these effects can be reversed with calcitriol (active vitamin D metabolite) supplementation. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fed for 10 weeks with control diet (DC) or vitamin D-deficient diet without (DD) or with oral calcitriol supplementation (0.15 mug/kg) in the last four weeks (DDS) (10 rats each group). A nondiabetic rat group that received control diet was also included (NR). After 10 weeks, rats were sacrificed; mesenteric arterial rings with and without endothelium were studied using wire myograph. Western blotting of the mesenteric arterial tissue was performed to determine the protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme. Antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the mesenteric arterial tissue were also measured. The DC group had significantly lower acetylcholine-induced relaxation and augmented endothelium-dependent contraction, with reduced eNOS expression, compared to NR rats. In mesenteric arteries of DD, acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent and sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent relaxations were lower than those in DC. Calcitriol supplementation in DDS restored endothelium-dependent relaxation. Mesenteric artery endothelium-dependent contraction of DD was greater than DC; it was not affected by calcitriol supplementation. The eNOS protein expression and SOD activity were significantly lower while MDA levels were greater in DD compared to DC; these effects were not observed in DDS that received calcitriol supplementation. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency causes eNOS downregulation and oxidative stress, thereby impairing the vascular function and posing an additional risk for microvascular complications in diabetes. Calcitriol supplementation to diabetics with vitamin D deficiency could potentially be useful in the management of or as an adjunct to diabetes-related cardiovascular complications.
33571310/Titanium dioxide nanoparticles elicited agro-morphological and physicochemical modifications in wheat plants to control Bipolaris sorokiniana The current study involves the biogenesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) by using Moringa oleifera Lam. aqueous leaf extract for the reduction of titanium dioxide salt into TiO2 nanoparticles. The biosynthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were observed by using the UV-visible spectrophotometry, SEM, EDX and XRD analytical methods. It was confirmed that the nanoparticles are crystalline and exist in the size range of 10-100 nm. The FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of O-H (hydrogen bonding), N-H (amide), C-C (alkanes) and C-I (Iodo-stretch) functional groups responsible for the stabilization of nanoparticles. Various concentrations (20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/L) of TiO2 NPs were applied exogenously on wheat plants infected with a fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana responsible to cause spot blotch disease at different time intervals. The measurement of disease incidence and percent disease index showed the time-dependent response and 40 mg/L was reported a stable concentration of TiO2 NPs to reduce the disease severity. The effects of biosynthesized TiO2 NPs were also evaluated for agro-morphological (leaf and root surface area, plant fresh and dry weight and yield parameters), physiological (relative water content, membrane stability index and chlorophyll content) and non-enzymatic metabolites (soluble sugar, protein, soluble phenol and flavonoid content) in wheat plants under biotic stress and 40 mg/L concentration of TiO2 NPs was found to be effective to elicit modifications to reduce biotic stress. The current study highlights the significant role of biosynthesized TiO2 NPs in controlling fungal diseases of wheat plants and thus ultimately improving the quality and yield of wheat plants.
33571289/Intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide prolongs emergence from propofol anesthesia in rats Background Neuromuscular blocking agents induce muscle paralysis via the prevention of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and may have additional effects at other sites of action. With regard to potential effects of neuromuscular blocking agents on the central nervous system, a definitive view has not been established. We investigated whether intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide affects the emergence from propofol anesthesia. Methods Using an in vivo rat model, we performed propofol infusion for 60 minutes, along with rocuronium bromide at various infusion rates or normal saline. Sugammadex or normal saline was injected at the end of the infusion period, and we evaluated the time to emergence from propofol anesthesia. We also examined the neuromuscular blocking, circulatory, and respiratory properties of propofol infusion along with rocuronium bromide infusion to ascertain possible factors affecting emergence. Results Intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide dose-dependently increased the time to emergence from propofol anesthesia. Sugammadex administered after propofol infusion not containing rocuronium bromide did not affect the time to emergence. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and pH were not affected by rocuronium bromide infusion. Neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide, even at the greatest infusion rate in the emergence experiment, was rapidly antagonized by sugammadex. Conclusions These results suggest that intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide dose-dependently delays the emergence from propofol anesthesia in rats. Future studies, such as detection of rocuronium in the cerebrospinal fluid or central nervous system, electrophysiologic studies, microinjection of sugammadex into the brain, etc., are necessary to determine the mechanism of this effect.
33571286/Lactic acid-containing products for bacterial vaginosis and their impact on the vaginal microbiota: A systematic review Objective The vaginal microbiota in bacterial vaginosis (BV) typically has low abundance of lactic acid producing lactobacilli. Lactic acid has properties that may make it effective for treating BV and/or restoring an optimal lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota. We conducted a systematic review to describe the effect of intravaginal lactic acid-containing products on BV cure, and their impact on vaginal microbiota composition (PROSPERO registration: CRD42018115982). Methods PubMed, Embase and OVID were searched from inception to November 2019 to identify eligible studies. Included studies evaluated an intravaginal lactic acid-containing product and reported BV cure using established diagnostic methods, and/or vaginal microbiota composition using molecular methods. Studies were independently screened and assessed, and the proportion of women cured post-treatment was calculated. Study results were described in a qualitative manner. Results We identified 1,883 articles and assessed 57 full-texts for eligibility. Seven different lactic acid-containing products were evaluated and differed with respect to excipients, lactic acid concentration and pH. Most studies had medium or high risk of bias. Three trials compared the efficacy of a lactic acid-containing product to metronidazole for BV cure. One study found lactic acid to be equivalent to metronidazole and two studies found lactic acid to be significantly inferior to metronidazole. Two studies included a control group receiving a placebo or no treatment. One reported lactic acid to be superior than no treatment and the other reported lactic acid to be equivalent to placebo. Lactic acid-containing products did not significantly impact the vaginal microbiota composition. Conclusion There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support the use of lactic acid-containing products for BV cure or vaginal microbiota modulation. However, adequately powered and rigorous randomised trials with accompanying vaginal microbiota data are needed to evaluate the efficacy of lactic acid as a BV treatment strategy.
33573677/Cell-free oxidized hemoglobin drives reactive oxygen species production and pro-inflammation in an immature primary rat mixed glial cell culture Background Germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH) is associated with deposition of redox active cell-free hemoglobin (Hb), derived from hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the cerebrum and cerebellum. In a recent study, using a preterm rabbit pup model of IVH, intraventricularly administered haptoglobin (Hp), a cell-free Hb scavenger, partially reversed the damaging effects observed following IVH. Together, this suggests that cell-free Hb is central in the pathophysiology of the injury to the immature brain following GM-IVH. An increased understanding of the causal pathways and metabolites involved in eliciting the damaging response following hemorrhage is essential for the continued development and implementation of neuroprotective treatments of GM-IVH in preterm infant. Methods We exposed immature primary rat mixed glial cells to hemorrhagic CSF obtained from preterm human infants with IVH (containing a mixture of Hb-metabolites) or to a range of pure Hb-metabolites, incl. oxidized Hb (mainly metHb with iron in Fe3+), oxyHb (mainly Fe2+), or low equivalents of heme, with or without co-administration with human Hp (a mixture of isotype 2-2/2-1). Following exposure, cellular response, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, secretion and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative markers were evaluated. Results Exposure of the glial cells to hemorrhagic CSF as well as oxidized Hb, but not oxyHb, resulted in a significantly increased rate of ROS production that positively correlated with the rate of production of pro-inflammatory and oxidative markers. Congruently, exposure to oxidized Hb caused a disintegration of the polygonal cytoskeletal structure of the glial cells in addition to upregulation of F-actin proteins in microglial cells. Co-administration of Hp partially reversed the damaging response of hemorrhagic CSF and oxidized Hb. Conclusion Exposure of mixed glial cells to oxidized Hb initiates a pro-inflammatory and oxidative response with cytoskeletal disintegration. Early administration of Hp, aiming to minimize the spontaneous autoxidation of cell-free oxyHb and liberation of heme, may provide a therapeutic benefit in preterm infant with GM-IVH.
33579265/A randomized placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial to evaluate the immunomodulatory activities of Atractylodes lancea (Thunb) DC. in healthy Thai subjects Background Atractylodes lancea (Thunb) DC. (AL) and bioactive compounds beta-eudesmol and atractylodin have been demonstrated in the in vitro and in vivo studies for their potential clinical use in cholangiocarcinoma. The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of AL in human subjects. Methods The modulatory effects of AL and beta-eudesmol and atractylodin on TNFalpha and IL6 expression in PBMCs were measured using real-time PCR. Blood samples were collected from forty-eight healthy subjects following oral administration of a single or multiple dosing of capsule formulation of the standardized AL extract or placebo. Serum cytokine profiles, lymphocyte subpopulations (B lymphocytes, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes, and NK cells), and cytotoxic activity of PBMCs against the cholangiocarcinoma cell line CL-6 were evaluated using cytometric bead array (CBA) with flow cytometry analysis. Results AL extract at almost all concentrations significantly inhibited both TNFalpha and IL6 expression in Con A-mediated inflammation in PBMCs. beta-Eudesmol at all concentrations significantly inhibited only IL6 expression. Atractylodin at the lowest concentration significantly inhibited the expression of both cytokines, while the highest concentration significantly inhibited only IL6 expression. The administration of AL at a single oral dose of 1000 mg appeared to decrease IFNgamma and IL10 and increase B cell, while significantly increase NK and CD4+ and CD8+ cells. A trend of increasing (compared with placebo) in the cytotoxic activity of PBMCs at 24 h of dosing was observed. AL at multiple dosing of 1000 mg for 21 days tended to decrease the production of all cytokines, while significantly inhibited IL17A production at 24 h of dosing. In addition, a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ cells was observed. A trend of increase in the cytotoxic activity of PBMCs was observed at 24 h but terminated at 48 h of dosing. Conclusions The results confirm the immunomodulatory activity of AL in humans. This activity, in complementary with the direct action of AL on inducing cholangiocarcinoma cell apoptosis, suggests its potential role for CCA control.

33579187/Transcriptomic and genome-wide association study reveal long noncoding RNAs responding to nitrogen deficiency in maize Background Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in essential biological processes. However, our understanding of lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and their responses to nitrogen stress is still limited. Results Here, we surveyed the lncRNAs and miRNAs in maize inbred line P178 leaves and roots at the seedling stage under high-nitrogen (HN) and low-nitrogen (LN) conditions using lncRNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq. A total of 894 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 38 different miRNAs were identified. Co-expression analysis found that two lncRNAs and four lncRNA-targets could competitively combine with ZmmiR159 and ZmmiR164, respectively. To dissect the genetic regulatory by which lncRNAs might enable adaptation to limited nitrogen availability, an association mapping panel containing a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array (56,110 SNPs) combined with variable LN tolerant-related phenotypes obtained from hydroponics was used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). By combining GWAS and RNA-Seq, 170 differently expressed lncRNAs within the range of significant markers were screened. Moreover, 40 consistently LN-responsive genes including those involved in glutamine biosynthesis and nitrogen acquisition in root were identified. Transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that LNC_002923 could inhabit ZmmiR159-guided cleavage of Zm00001d015521. Conclusions These lncRNAs containing trait-associated significant SNPs could consider to be related to root development and nutrient utilization. Taken together, the results of our study can provide new insights into the potential regulatory roles of lncRNAs in response to LN stress, and give valuable information for further screening of candidates as well as the improvement of maize resistance to LN stress.

33323547/Silencing LINC00482 inhibits tumor-associated inflammation and angiogenesis through down-regulation of MMP-15 via FOXA1 in bladder cancer Multiple studies have previously demonstrated that long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play an important role in the development of bladder cancer. However, little is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms of LINC00482 functions in bladder cancer. The current study aimed to elucidate the role of LINC00482 in the progression of bladder cancer. The initial step was to detect the expressions of LINC00482 and MMP15 in bladder cancer cells and tissue. According to the results from the RT-qPCR, LINC00482 and MMP15 were both highly expressed in bladder cancer cells and tissue. The relationship among LINC00482, FOXA1 and MMP15 was studied via dual-luciferase reporter assay. LINC00482 was positively correlated with MMP15. LINC00482 promoted MMP15 expression by recruiting FOXA1. Using the gain- and loss-of-function approaches, silencing of LINC00482 resulted in the downregulation of VEGF and NF-kappaB protein levels, decreased expression of inflammatory factors, and inhibited angiogenesis. Silencing of LINC00482 also suppressed tumor-associated inflammation and angiogenesis in vivo, which was found to be reversed by the overexpression of MMP15. The present study demonstrated that LINC00482 induced the expression of MMP15 by interacting with FOXA1, thereby contributing to the inflammation and angiogenesis in bladder cancer.
33323546/Antitumor effect of poly lactic acid nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin and chloroquine on the oral squamous cell carcinoma Purpose: Poly lactic acid (PLA) combined with cisplatin-chloroquine nanoparticles (CDDP/CQ-PLA NPs) and PLA combined with cisplatin nanoparticles (CDDP-PLA NPs) were prepared to investigate their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) Cal-27cell line. Patients and methods: We prepared CDDP/CQ-PLA NPs and CDDP-PLA NPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to detect the physiological characteristics and particle size parameters of drug-loaded nanoparticles. The drug concentration and cumulative release were measured by UV and visible spectrophotometer. MTT assay was used to detect viability of Cal-27 cells. Annexin/PI staining was used to detect cell apoptosis. Biological kits were used to detect malondialdehyde (MDA) content, catalase (CAT) activity, antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GSH PX) activity in Cal-27 cells. Western blot was used to detect apoptosis and autophagy of Cal-27 cells. Results: CDDP/CQ-PLA NPs and CDDP -PLA NPs had good drug loaded nanoparticles and drug release. CDDP/CQ-PLA NPs showed higher ROS and apoptosis rate, and lower autophagy than CDDP-PLA NPs. Conclusion: CDDP/CQ-PLA NPs reduced autophagy and enhanced ROS and apoptosis of Cal-27 cells, which shows a potential in the clinical treatment of OSCC.
33323555/Fucoxanthin attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88 signaling axis Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical clinical condition with a high mortality rate. It is believed that the inflammatory storm is a critical contributor to the occurrence of ALI. Fucoxanthin is a natural extract from marine seaweed with remarkable biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-obesity. However, the anti-inflammatory activity of Fucoxanthin has not been extensively studied. The current study aimed to elucidate the effects and the molecular mechanism of Fucoxanthin on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury. In this study, Fucoxanthin efficiently reduced the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-10, IL-6, iNOS, and Cox-2, and down-regulated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in Raw264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, based on the network pharmacological analysis, our results showed that anti-inflammation signaling pathways were screened as fundamental action mechanisms of Fucoxanthin on ALI. Fucoxanthin also significantly ameliorated the inflammatory responses in LPS-induced ALI mice. Interestingly, our results revealed that Fucoxanthin prevented the expression of TLR4/MyD88 in Raw264.7 macrophages. We further validated Fucoxanthin binds to the TLR4 pocket using molecular docking simulations. Altogether, these results suggest that Fucoxanthin suppresses the TLR4/MyD88 signaling axis by targeting TLR4, which inhibits LPS-induced ALI, and fucoxanthin inhibition may provide a novel strategy for controlling the initiation and progression of ALI.
33577593/Direct antiviral agents for hepatitis C and drug interaction risk: A retrospective cohort study with real and simulated data on medication interaction, prevalence of comorbidities and comedications Introduction and aim Comorbidities and comedication are common in patients with hepatitis C, which could result in a risk of drug-drug interaction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities, comedication and drug-drug interactions involving direct-acting antivirals in this population. Methods Comorbidities and comedications were evaluated in a retrospective cohort of hepatitis C patients. Drug-drug interactions were estimated in real life and with simulated data on comedications following drug regimens: telaprevir; elbasvir/grazoprevir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r/ritonavir (2D regimen), and sofosbuvir/simeprevir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir; 2D/dasabuvir (3D regimen); glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. The interactions were evaluated according to the University of Liverpool database. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS  18.0. Results Data from 1433 patients with hepatitis C were evaluated. The mean patient age was 51.7 years (SD +- 10.7), and 50.6% were female. Direct-acting antivirals were prescribed for 345 (24.1%) patients, and a sustained virological response occurred in 264 (76.5%). The main comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension [436 (30.4%)], diabetes mellitus [352 (24.6%)] and depression [130 (9.1%)]. The mean number of comorbidities was 1.52 (median [IQR] of 1.00 [1.00-2.00]). The mean number of comedications was 3.16 (median [IQR] of 3.00 [1.00-5.00]). A total of 12916 drug-drug interactions were found, of which 1.859 (14.4%) were high risk, with a mean of 1.29 +- 3.13 per patient. The 3D regimen, as well as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, presented the highest drug-drug interaction indexes. Conclusion Comorbidities and comedications are common in patients with hepatitis C, as are drug-drug interactions. Even when second generation drugs are used, the occurrence of drug-drug interactions still presents a significant risk.
33577576/Effects of glyphosate residues and different concentrate feed proportions in dairy cow rations on hepatic gene expression, liver histology and biochemical blood parameters Glyphosate (GLY) is worldwide one of the most used active substances in non-selective herbicides. Although livestock might be orally exposed via GLY-contaminated feedstuffs, not much is known about possible hepatotoxic effects of GLY. As hepatic xenobiotic and nutrient metabolism are interlinked, toxic effects of GLY residues might be influenced by hepatic nutrient supply. Therefore, a feeding trial with lactating dairy cows was conducted to investigate effects of GLY-contaminated feedstuffs and different concentrate feed proportions (CFP) in the diets as tool for varying nutrient supply to the liver. For this, 61 German Holstein cows (207 +- 49 days in milk; mean +- standard deviation) were either fed a GLY-contaminated total mixed ration (TMR, GLY groups, mean GLY intake 122.7 mug/kg body weight/day) or control TMR (CON groups, mean GLY intake 1.2 mug/kg body weight/day) for 16 weeks. Additionally, both groups were further split into subgroups fed a lower (LC, 30% on dry matter basis) or higher (HC, 60% on dry matter basis) CFP resulting in groups CONHC (n = 16), CONLC (n = 16), GLYHC (n = 15), GLYLC (n = 14). Blood parameters aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, triglyceride, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, acetic acid and urea and histopathological evaluation were not influenced by GLY, whereas all mentioned parameters were at least affected by time, CFP or an interactive manner between time and CFP. Total bilirubin blood concentration was significantly influenced by an interaction between GLY and CFP with temporarily elevated concentrations in GLYHC, whereas the biological relevance remained unclear. Gene expression analysis indicated 167 CFP-responsive genes, while seven genes showed altered expression in GLY groups compared to CON groups. Since expression changes of GLY-responsive genes were low and liver-related blood parameters changed either not at all or only slightly, the tested GLY formulation was considered to have no toxic effects on the liver of dairy cows.
33577585/Alteration of oxidative-stress and related marker levels in mouse colonic tissues and fecal microbiota structures with chronic ethanol administration: Implications for the pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer Chronic ethanol consumption is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, and ethanol-induced reactive oxygen species have been suggested to play important roles in the pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer (ER-CRC). In this study, the effects of 10-week chronic administration of ethanol on the colonic levels of oxidative stress and advance glycation end product (AGE) levels, as well as fecal microbiota structures, were examined in a mouse model. Chronic oral administration of ethanol in mice (1.0 mL of 1.5% or 5.0% ethanol (v/v) per day per mouse, up to 10 weeks) resulted in the elevation of colonic levels of oxidative stress markers (such as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxynonenal) compared to control mice, and this was consistently accompanied by elevated levels of inflammation-associated cytokines and immune cells (Th17 and macrophages) and a decreased level of regulatory T (Treg) cells to produce colonic lesions. It also resulted in an alteration of mouse fecal microbiota structures, reminiscent of the alterations observed in human inflammatory bowel disease, and this appeared to be consistent with the proposed sustained generation of oxidative stress in the colonic environment during chronic ethanol consumption. Moreover, the first experimental evidence that chronic ethanol administration results in elevated levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptors (RAGE) in the colonic tissues in mice is also shown, implying enhanced RAGE-mediated signaling with chronic ethanol administration. The RAGE-mediated signaling pathway has thus far been implicated as a link between the accumulation of AGEs and the development of many types of chronic colitis and cancers. Thus, enhancement of this pathway likely exacerbates the ethanol-induced inflammatory states of colonic tissues and might at least partly contribute to the pathogenesis of ER-CRC.
33577580/Candidate drugs for preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: A cross-sectional study Background and purpose Establishment of drug therapy to prevent rupture of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is needed. Previous human and animal studies have gradually clarified candidate drugs for preventive treatment of IA rupture. However, because most of these candidates belong to classes of drugs frequently co-administered to prevent cardiovascular diseases, epidemiological studies evaluating these drugs simultaneously should be performed. Furthermore, because drugs included in the same class may have different effects in terms of disease prevention, drug-by-drug assessments are important for planning intervention trials. Materials and methods We performed a cross-sectional study enrolling patients diagnosed with IAs between July 2011 and June 2019 at our institution. Patients were divided into ruptured or unruptured groups. The drugs investigated were selected according to evidence suggested by either human or animal studies. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of drug treatment with rupture status. We also performed drug-by-drug assessments of the association, including dose-response relationships, with rupture status. Results In total, 310 patients with ruptured and 887 patients with unruptured IAs were included. Multivariate analysis revealed an inverse association of statins (odds ratio (OR), 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.77), calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.41; 95% CI 0.30-0.58), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.48-0.93) with ruptured IAs. Moreover, inverse dose-response relationships with rupture status were observed for pitavastatin and rosuvastatin among statins, benidipine, cilnidipine, and amlodipine among calcium channel blockers, and valsartan, azilsartan, candesartan, and olmesartan among ARBs. Only non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were positively associated with ruptured IAs (OR, 3.24; 95% CI 1.71-6.13). Conclusions The present analysis suggests that several types of statins, calcium channel blockers, and ARBs are candidate drugs for preventive treatment of unruptured IAs.
33576907/Green synthesis of silver, iron and gold nanoparticles of lycopene extracted from tomato: their characterization and cytotoxicity against COLO320DM, HT29 and Hella cell Our study aimed at development of Silver, Iron and Gold nanoparticles of Lycopene isolated from tomato by using green synthesis technique and to evaluate its anticancer potential against colorectal and cervical cancer. Lycopene was extracted by benzene extraction method and the silver, iron and gold nanoparticles were developed by green synthesis method. 1% aqueous extract of isolated Lycopene was mixed with 1% solutions of AgNO3, FeCl3 and HAuCl4 solutions and incubated at ambient temperature for 3-4 h separately and observed for the color change which is an indicative of formation of the nanoparticles. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, SEM, XRD analysis and evaluated for their antimicrobial potential. The cytotoxicity studies were carried out by in vitro assay like MTT, SRB and Tryphan blue method against Colo 320 DM, HT 29, and Hella. SEM showed nanosized particles of 50-100 nm range, whereas no antimicrobial activity was exhibited by the prepared nanoparticles. In MTT assay the LyAgNP showed maximum 41.41 +- 0.4124% inhibition against COLO320DM, whereas LyGNP exhibited 41.47 +- 0.4469% inhibition against HT 29 and LyAgNP showed 40.9 +- 0.6908% inhibition against Hella cells. In SRB assay LyAgNP showed maximum 82.68 +- 1.1798% inhibition against COLO320DM, whereas LyGNP exhibited maximum 91.21 +- 0.2372% inhibition against HT29 and 87.98 +- 0.5878% inhibition against Hella cells. In tryphan blue assay against COLO320DM, HT29 and Hella cells, the maximum inhibition exhibited by the prepared nanoparticles were observed as LyGNP 83.45 +- 0.4694%, LyAgNP 88.05 +- 0.1870% and LyAgNP65.47 +- 0.4766%. We conclude that the developed nanoparticles of Lycopene exhibited potential anticancer activity against Colorectal and cervical cancer cell as compared with pure Lycopene. Highlights The present research work is focused on green synthesis of Silver iron and gold nanoparticles of isolated lycopene from tomato. Our work aimed to assess scientifically the anticancer efficacy of the developed metal nanoparticles on in vitro colon and cervical cell lines. The results of the study revealed that developed nanoparticles exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against colon cancer and cervical cancer as compared with pure lycopene (phytoiconstituents). Use of the isolated phytoconstituents which are devoid of toxic effects of all other anticancer drugs and better absorption and cellular uptake due to its nano size.
33579270/Efficacy of Euphorbia helioscopia in context to a possible connection between antioxidant and antidiabetic activities: a comparative study of different extracts Background Euphorbia helioscopia, conventionally known as sun spurge, has been used as a traditional medicine to treat different diseases owing to its reported antitumor, antiviral and antioxidant activities. Methods The current research was formulated to assess the in-vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic ability of Euphorbia helioscopia subsequent to the phytochemical analysis of its various extracts. For this purpose, methanol, ethanol and aqueous extracts were prepared using the whole dried plant. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts was done to evaluate the total flavonoid components (TFC) and total phenolic components (TPC) in the extracts. A total of seven phenolic and three flavonoid contents were documented and quantified using HPLC. Antioxidant values were found by DPPH  assay, FRAP and ABTS assays. The antidiabetic potential of the extracts was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ability of the activity of enzymes alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase. Results After analyzing statistically, the results showed that methanolic extract possesses the highest TFC and TPC values while aqueous extract encompassed the lowest level of these contents. Invitro results showed that methanolic extract of the Euphorbia helioscopia has the maximum antioxidant capability since it showed the highest scavenging ability towards the DPPH  (IC50 value = 0.06 +- 0.02 mg/ml), FRAP (758.9 +- 25.1 muMFe+ 2/g), and ABTS (689 +- 25.94 muMTEq/g) due to the presence of high TPC (24.77 +- 0.35 mgGAEq/g) and TFC (17.95 +- 0.32 mgQEq/g) values. Antidiabetic activity in terms of inhibition potential of alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase activity was also observed maximum in methanolic extract having lowest IC50 value (0.4 +- 0.01 mg/ml and 0.45 +- 0.01 mg/ml respectively) and minimum in the aqueous extract (IC50 value = 0.57 +- 0.02 mg/ml and 0.76 +- 0.1 mg/ml respectively). Conclusion The experiment outcomes have shown that Euphorbia helioscopia extracts used in the current study contain antioxidant and antidiabetic activities; however, it is highest in its methanolic extract. The presence of the same trend towards the highest antidiabetic activity of the methanolic extract in terms of maximum inhibiting activity of alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase enzymes suggests a close association of TFC and TPC in minimizing diabetes.
33583431/Comparison of the efficacy of different androgens measured by LC-MS/MS in representing hyperandrogenemia and an evaluation of adrenal-origin androgens with a dexamethasone suppression test in patients with PCOS Background The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of different androgens measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in representing hyperandrogenemia and to evaluate adrenal-origin androgens with a dexamethasone suppression test in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods One hundred and two patients with PCOS and 41 healthy volunteers were recruited and total serum testosterone (TT), androstenedione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were measured by LC-MS/MS. ROC analysis was performed to compare the efficacy of different androgens in representing hyperandrogenemia. Dexamethasone suppression test was performed in 51 patients with PCOS and above indicators were measured after dexamethasone administration. The prediction efficacy of DHEA and DHEA-S at baseline in the dexamethasone suppression test was evaluated with ROC analysis. Results The AUCs of TT, AD, free androgen index (FAI) and DHEA-S in ROC analysis for representing hyperandrogenemia were 0.816, 0.842, 0.937 and 0.678, respectively. The optimal cutoff value of TT was 0.337 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 72.0% and specificity of 82.93%. The optimal cutoff value for AD was 1.309 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 81.0% and specificity of 73.17%. The optimal cutoff value of the FAI was 2.50, with a sensitivity of 87.0% and specificity of 92.68%. Alternatively, AD or FAI more than the optimal cutoff values as evidence of hyperandrogenemia had the highest sensitivity of 91.18%. The levels of cortisol, DHEA and DHEA-S were all suppressed to narrow ranges after dexamethasone administration. Nine and 8 of 51 patients with PCOS had significant decreases in TT and AD, respectively. DHEA can be used as a indicator for predicting significant decrease of TT in dexamethasone suppression test with cutoff value of 13.28 ng/ml. A total of 27.5% (14/51) of patients had DHEA-S excess, but only 1 of 9 patients who had a significant decrease in TT had elevated level of DHEA-S at baseline. Conclusions AD measured by LC-MS/MS can represent hyperandrogenemia in PCOS patients and, combined with TT or FAI, can improve the screening efficiency of hyperandrogenemia. Seventeen percent of PCOS patients had adrenal-origin androgen dominance, with TT significantly decreasing after 2 days of dexamethasone administration. Adrenal-origin androgen dominance was not parallel with DHEA-S excess in patients with PCOS.
33588880/ATP-evoked intracellular Ca2+ transients shape the ionic permeability of human microglia from epileptic temporal cortex Background Intracellular Ca2+ modulates several microglial activities, such as proliferation, migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory mediator secretion. Extracellular ATP, the levels of which significantly change during epileptic seizures, activates specific receptors leading to an increase of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Here, we aimed to functionally characterize human microglia obtained from cortices of subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy, focusing on the Ca2+-mediated response triggered by purinergic signaling. Methods Fura-2 based fluorescence microscopy was used to measure [Ca2+]i in primary cultures of human microglial cells obtained from surgical specimens. The perforated patch-clamp technique, which preserves the cytoplasmic milieu, was used to measure ATP-evoked Ca2+-dependent whole-cell currents. Results In human microglia extracellular ATP evoked [Ca2+]i increases depend on Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space and on Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular compartments. Extracellular ATP also induced a transient fivefold potentiation of the total transmembrane current, which was completely abolished when [Ca2+]i increases were prevented by removing external Ca2+ and using an intracellular Ca2+ chelator. TRAM-34, a selective KCa3.1 blocker, significantly reduced the ATP-induced current potentiation but did not abolish it. The removal of external Cl- in the presence of TRAM-34 further lowered the ATP-evoked effect. A direct comparison between the ATP-evoked mean current potentiation and mean Ca2+ transient amplitude revealed a linear correlation. Treatment of microglial cells with LPS for 48 h did not prevent the ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization but completely abolished the ATP-mediated current potentiation. The absence of the Ca2+-evoked K+ current led to a less sustained ATP-evoked Ca2+ entry, as shown by the faster Ca2+ transient kinetics observed in LPS-treated microglia. Conclusions Our study confirms a functional role for KCa3.1 channels in human microglia, linking ATP-evoked Ca2+ transients to changes in membrane conductance, with an inflammation-dependent mechanism, and suggests that during brain inflammation the KCa3.1-mediated microglial response to purinergic signaling may be reduced.

33588866/Ceria nanoparticles ameliorate white matter injury after intracerebral hemorrhage: microglia-astrocyte involvement in remyelination Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can induce excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may subsequently cause severe white matter injury. The process of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation is orchestrated by microglia and astrocytes, and ROS also drives the activation of microglia and astrocytes. In light of the potent ROS scavenging capacity of ceria nanoparticles (CeNP), we aimed to investigate whether treatment with CeNP ameliorates white matter injury by modulating ROS-induced microglial polarization and astrocyte alteration. Methods ICH was induced in vivo by collagenase VII injection. Mice were administered with PLX3397 for depleting microglia. Primary microglia and astrocytes were used for in vitro experiments. Transmission electron microscopy analysis and immunostaining were performed to verify the positive effects of CeNP in remyelination and OPC differentiation. Flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to detect microglia polarization, astrocyte alteration, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results CeNP treatment strongly inhibited ROS-induced NF-kappaB p65 translocation in both microglia and astrocytes, and significantly decreased the expression of M1 microglia and A1 astrocyte. Furthermore, we found that CeNP treatment promoted remyelination and OPC differentiation after ICH, and such effects were alleviated after microglial depletion. Interestingly, we also found that the number of mature oligodendrocytes was moderately increased in ICH + CeNP + PLX3397-treated mice compared to the ICH + vehicle + PLX3397 group. Therefore, astrocytes might participate in the pathophysiological process. The subsequent phagocytosis assay indicated that A1 astrocyte highly expressed C3, which could bind with microglia C3aR and hinder microglial engulfment of myelin debris. This result further replenished the feedback mechanism from astrocytes to microglia. Conclusion The present study reveals a new mechanism in white matter injury after ICH: ICH induces M1 microglia and A1 astrocyte through ROS-induced NF-kappaB p65 translocation that hinders OPC maturation. Subsequently, A1 astrocytes inhibit microglial phagocytosis of myelin debris via an astrocytic C3-microglial C3aR axis. Polyethylene glycol-CeNP treatment inhibits this pathological process and ultimately promotes remyelination. Such findings enlighten us that astrocytes and microglia should be regarded as a functional unit in future works.

33464721/Increasing skeletal muscle carnitine content in older individuals increases whole-body fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise Abstract Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) utilization is impaired in older individuals, and IMCL accumulation is associated with insulin resistance. We hypothesized that increasing muscle total carnitine content in older men would increase fat oxidation and IMCL utilization during exercise, and improve insulin sensitivity. Fourteen healthy older men (69 +- 1 year, BMI 26.5 +- 0.8 kg/m2) performed 1 h of cycling at 50% VO2max and, on a separate occasion, underwent a 60 mU/m2/min euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp before and after 25 weeks of daily ingestion of a 220 ml insulinogenic beverage (44.4 g carbohydrate, 13.8 g protein) containing 4.5 g placebo (n = 7) or L-carnitine L-tartrate (n = 7). During supplementation, participants performed twice-weekly cycling for 1 h at 50% VO2max. Placebo ingestion had no effect on muscle carnitine content or total fat oxidation during exercise at 50% VO2max. L-carnitine supplementation resulted in a 20% increase in muscle total carnitine content (20.1 +- 1.2 to 23.9 +- 1.7 mmol/kg/dm; p < 0.01) and a 20% increase in total fat oxidation (181.1 +- 15.0 to 220.4 +- 19.6 J/kg lbm/min; p < 0.01), predominantly due to increased IMCL utilization. These changes were associated with increased expression of genes involved in fat metabolism (ACAT1, DGKD & PLIN2; p < 0.05). There was no change in resting insulin-stimulated whole-body or skeletal muscle glucose disposal after supplementation. This is the first study to demonstrate that a carnitine-mediated increase in fat oxidation is achievable in older individuals. This warrants further investigation given reduced lipid turnover is associated with poor metabolic health in older adults. High Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content in older individuals, likely due to reduced fat oxidation, is associated with insulin resistance. The present study demonstrated that increasing muscle carnitine content in healthy older males resulted in a 20% increase in fat oxidation during exercise, likely due to an increase in IMCL utilization. This was supported by changes in expression of genes associated with IMCL turnover and oxidation, but no improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed. 
33497523/Targeting age-specific changes in CD4+ T cell metabolism ameliorates alloimmune responses and prolongs graft survival Abstract Age impacts alloimmunity. Effects of aging on T-cell metabolism and the potential to interfere with immunosuppressants have not been explored yet. Here, we dissected metabolic pathways of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in aging and offer novel immunosuppressive targets. Upon activation, CD4+ T cells from old mice failed to exhibit adequate metabolic reprogramming resulting into compromised metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. Comparable results were also observed in elderly human patients. Although glutaminolysis remained the dominant and age-independent source of mitochondria for activated CD4+ T cells, old but not young CD4+ T cells relied heavily on glutaminolysis. Treating young and old murine and human CD4+ T cells with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), a glutaminolysis inhibitor resulted in significantly reduced IFN-gamma production and compromised proliferative capacities specifically of old CD4+ T cells. Of translational relevance, old and young mice that had been transplanted with fully mismatched skin grafts and treated with DON demonstrated dampened Th1- and Th17-driven alloimmune responses. Moreover, DON diminished cytokine production and proliferation of old CD4+ T cells in vivo leading to a significantly prolonged allograft survival specifically in old recipients. Graft prolongation in young animals, in contrast, was only achieved when DON was applied in combination with an inhibition of glycolysis (2-deoxy-d-glucose, 2-DG) and OXPHOS (metformin), two alternative metabolic pathways. Notably, metabolic treatment had not been linked to toxicities. Remarkably, immunosuppressive capacities of DON were specific to CD4+ T cells as adoptively transferred young CD4+ T cells prevented immunosuppressive capacities of DON on allograft survival in old recipients. Depletion of CD8+ T cells did not alter transplant outcomes in either young or old recipients. Taken together, our data introduce an age-specific metabolic reprogramming of CD4+ T cells. Targeting those pathways offers novel and age-specific approaches for immunosuppression. Upon activation, old CD4+ T cells failed to exhibit adequate metabolic reprogramming resulting into compromised metabolic pathways. Since glutaminolysis displayed their dominant fuel source for mitochondria, treatment with a glutaminolysis inhibitor (DON) restricted activation, proliferative capacities and cytokine production in an age-specific manner. These effects translated into dampened alloimmune responses and dramatically prolonged allograft survival specifically in old transplant recipients.  
33455051/Lycorine hydrochloride suppresses stress-induced premature cellular senescence by stabilizing the genome of human cells Abstract Lycorine, a natural compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Lycoris radiata, exhibits multiple pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer effects. Accumulating evidence also indicates that lycorine might hold the potential to treat age-associated Alzheimer's disease. However, whether lycorine is involved in delaying the onset of cellular senescence and its underlying mechanisms has not been determined. Here, we demonstrate that the salt of lycorine, lycorine hydrochloride, significantly suppressed stress-induced premature cellular senescence (SIPS) by ~2-fold, as determined by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining and the expression of p16 and p21. In addition, pretreating cells with lycorine hydrochloride significantly inhibited the expression of CXCL1 and IL1alpha, two factors of the senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP) in SIPS cells. Further experiments revealed that lycorine hydrochloride promoted both the homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Mechanistic studies suggested that lycorine hydrochloride treatment promoted the transcription of SIRT1 and SIRT6, critical longevity genes positively regulating both HR and NHEJ repair pathways, thereby stimulating DSB repair and stabilizing genomes. Inhibiting SIRT1 enzymatic activity abrogated the protective effect of lycorine hydrochloride on delaying the onset of SIPS, repairing DSBs, and restoring genome integrity. In summary, our work indicates that lycorine hydrochloride might hold therapeutic potential for treating age-associated diseases or promoting healthy aging by stabilizing genomes. Lycorine hydrochloride delays stress-induced premature cellular senescence by promoting DSB repair.  
33524231/Metformin inhibits chronic kidney disease-induced DNA damage and senescence of mesenchymal stem cells Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising source of cell-based regenerative therapy. In consideration of the risk of allosensitization, autologous MSC-based therapy is preferred over allogenic transplantation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it remains uncertain whether adequate cell functionality is maintained under uremic conditions. As chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in CKD may lead to the accumulation of senescent cells, we investigated cellular senescence of CKD MSCs and determined the effects of metformin on CKD-associated cellular senescence in bone marrow MSCs from sham-operated and subtotal nephrectomized mice and further explored in adipose tissue-derived MSCs from healthy kidney donors and patients with CKD. CKD MSCs showed reduced proliferation, accelerated senescence, and increased DNA damage as compared to control MSCs. These changes were significantly attenuated following metformin treatment. Lipopolysaccharide and transforming growth factor beta1-treated HK2 cells showed lower tubular expression of proinflammatory and fibrogenesis markers upon co-culture with metformin-treated CKD MSCs than with untreated CKD MSCs, suggestive of enhanced paracrine action of CKD MSCs mediated by metformin. In unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys, metformin-treated CKD MSCs more effectively attenuated inflammation and fibrosis as compared to untreated CKD MSCs. Thus, metformin preconditioning may exhibit a therapeutic benefit by targeting accelerated senescence of CKD MSCs. Increased senescence of CKD MSCs may contribute to poor regenerative potential. Metformin decreased CKD-induced prelamin A accumulation and DNA damage signaling, which may lead to cellular senescence. We suggest metformin preconditioning as an effective strategy to overcome the senescence-associated barrier to autologous patient-derived MSC therapy in CKD. 
33480139/Incomplete proline catabolism drives premature sperm aging Abstract Infertility is an increasingly common health issue, with rising prevalence in advanced parental age. Environmental stress has established negative effects on reproductive health, however, the impact of altering cellular metabolism and its endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) on fertility remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the loss of proline dehydrogenase, the first committed step in proline catabolism, is relatively benign. In contrast, disruption of alh-6, which facilitates the second step of proline catabolism by converting 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to glutamate, results in premature reproductive senescence, specifically in males. The premature reproductive senescence in alh-6 mutant males is caused by aberrant ROS homeostasis, which can be countered by genetically limiting the first committed step of proline catabolism that functions upstream of ALH-6 or by pharmacological treatment with antioxidants. Taken together, our work uncovers proline metabolism as a critical component of normal sperm function that can alter the rate of aging in the male reproductive system. The loss of alh-6, a nuclear encoded mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the second step of proline catabolism by converting 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to glutamate, disrupts endogenous redox imbalance and causes premature reproductive aging in C. elegans males. Mutation in prdh-1, the upstream enzyme in the proline catabolic pathway which breaks down proline to P5C, suppresses the sperm defects in alh-6 mutant males by preventing the accumulation of the toxic intermediate P5C. Similarly, dietary antioxidant treatment rescues the premature aging defects in alh-6 mutant sperm, implicating the role of proline catabolism in maintaining endogenous ROS homeostasis and male reproductive senescence.  
33443781/Metformin treatment in late middle age improves cognitive function with alleviation of microglial activation and enhancement of autophagy in the hippocampus Ten weeks of metformin treatment in late middle age is efficacious for improving cognitive function in the old age. Improved cognitive function following metformin treatment was linked with antiinflammatory effects, the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and increased autophagy in the aged hippocampus. The results suggest that metformin therapy in middle age leads to better cognitive function in old age.   Summary Metformin, a drug widely used for treating diabetes, can prolong the lifespan in several species. Metformin also has the promise to slow down age-related cognitive impairment. However, metformin's therapeutic use as an anti-aging drug is yet to be accepted because of conflicting animal and human studies results. We examined the effects of metformin treatment in late middle age on cognitive function in old age. Eighteen-month-old male C57BL6/J mice received metformin or no treatment for 10 weeks. A series of behavioral tests revealed improved cognitive function in animals that received metformin. Such findings were evident from a better ability for pattern separation, object location, and recognition memory function. Quantification of microglia revealed that metformin treatment reduced the incidence of pathological microglial clusters with alternative activation of microglia into an M2 phenotype, displaying highly ramified processes in the hippocampus. Metformin treatment also seemed to reduce astrocyte hypertrophy. Additional analysis demonstrated that metformin treatment in late middle age increased adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels, and the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, and enhanced autophagy in the hippocampus. However, metformin treatment did not alter neurogenesis or synapses in the hippocampus, implying that improved cognitive function with metformin did not involve enhanced neurogenesis or neosynaptogenesis. The results provide new evidence that metformin treatment commencing in late middle age has promise for improving cognitive function in old age. Modulation of microglia, proinflammatory cytokines, and autophagy appear to be the mechanisms by which metformin facilitated functional benefits in the aged brain.
33484480/Unlike dietary restriction, rapamycin fails to extend lifespan and reduce transcription stress in progeroid DNA repair-deficient mice Abstract Dietary restriction (DR) and rapamycin extend healthspan and life span across multiple species. We have recently shown that DR in progeroid DNA repair-deficient mice dramatically extended healthspan and trippled life span. Here, we show that rapamycin, while significantly lowering mTOR signaling, failed to improve life span nor healthspan of DNA repair-deficient Ercc1  /- mice, contrary to DR tested in parallel. Rapamycin interventions focusing on dosage, gender, and timing all were unable to alter life span. Even genetically modifying mTOR signaling failed to increase life span of DNA repair-deficient mice. The absence of effects by rapamycin on P53 in brain and transcription stress in liver is in sharp contrast with results obtained by DR, and appoints reducing DNA damage and transcription stress as an important mode of action of DR, lacking by rapamycin. Together, this indicates that mTOR inhibition does not mediate the beneficial effects of DR in progeroid mice, revealing that DR and rapamycin strongly differ in their modes of action. In this study, we have subjected Ercc1 Delta/- progeroid DNA repair-deficient mice to rapamycin and dietary restriction (DR), two well-known interventions for extending life span across multiple species. DR again resulted in extreme benefits for these mice while rapamycin interventions, focusing on dosage, gender, and timing as well as modulation of mTor via genetic means, all failed to improve life span, healthspan, or the DNA damage indicator transcription stress. 
33504656/Absence of KpsM (Slr0977) Impairs the Secretion of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) and Impacts Carbon Fluxes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Most cyanobacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that fulfill different biological roles depending on the strain/environmental conditions. The interest in the cyanobacterial EPS synthesis/export pathways has been increasing, not only to optimize EPS production but also to efficiently redirect carbon flux toward the production of other compounds, allowing the implementation of industrial systems based on cyanobacterial cell factories. ABSTRACT Many cyanobacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), composed mainly of heteropolysaccharides, that play a variety of physiological roles, being crucial for cell protection, motility, and biofilm formation. However, due to their complexity, the EPS biosynthetic pathways as well as their assembly and export mechanisms are still far from being fully understood. Here, we show that the absence of a putative EPS-related protein, KpsM (Slr0977), has a pleiotropic effect on Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 physiology, with a strong impact on the export of EPS and carbon fluxes. The kpsM mutant exhibits a significant reduction of released polysaccharides and a smaller decrease of capsular polysaccharides, but it accumulates more polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) than the wild type. In addition, this strain shows a light/cell density-dependent clumping phenotype and exhibits an altered protein secretion capacity. Furthermore, the most important structural component of pili, the protein PilA, was found to have a modified glycosylation pattern in the mutant compared to the wild type. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed significant changes in the mechanisms of energy production and conversion, namely, photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and carbon metabolism, in response to the inactivation of slr0977. Overall, this work shows for the first time that cells with impaired EPS secretion undergo transcriptomic and proteomic adjustments, highlighting the importance of EPS as a major carbon sink in cyanobacteria. The accumulation of PHB in cells of the mutant, without affecting significantly its fitness/growth rate, points to its possible use as a chassis for the production of compounds of interest. IMPORTANCE Most cyanobacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that fulfill different biological roles depending on the strain/environmental conditions. The interest in the cyanobacterial EPS synthesis/export pathways has been increasing, not only to optimize EPS production but also to efficiently redirect carbon flux toward the production of other compounds, allowing the implementation of industrial systems based on cyanobacterial cell factories. Here, we show that a Synechocystis kpsM (slr0977) mutant secretes less EPS than the wild type, accumulating more carbon intracellularly, as polyhydroxybutyrate. Further characterization showed a light/cell density-dependent clumping phenotype, altered protein secretion, and modified glycosylation of PilA. The proteome and transcriptome of the mutant revealed significant changes, namely, in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Altogether, this work provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of kpsM disruption on Synechocystis physiology, highlighting the importance of EPS as a carbon sink and showing how cells adapt when their secretion is impaired, and the redirection of the carbon fluxes.
33504661/Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Resistance and Mechanisms in Carbapenem-Nonsusceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is one of the most difficult health care-associated infections to treat due to the ability of the organism to acquire a multitude of resistance mechanisms and express the multidrug resistance phenotype. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T), a novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, addresses an unmet medical need in patients with these multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections. ABSTRACT This study established the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) and its genotypic resistance mechanisms by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 195 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CNSPA) clinical isolates recovered from Singapore between 2009 and 2020. C/T susceptibility rates were low, at 37.9%. Cross-resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam was observed, although susceptibility to the agent was slightly higher, at 41.0%. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that C/T resistance was largely mediated by the presence of horizontally acquired beta-lactamases, especially metallo-beta-lactamases. These were primarily disseminated in well-recognized high-risk clones belonging to sequence types (ST) 235, 308, and 179. C/T resistance was also observed in several non-carbapenemase-producing isolates, in which resistance was likely mediated by beta-lactamases and, to a smaller extent, mutations in AmpC-related genes. There was no obvious mechanism of resistance observed in five isolates. The high C/T resistance highlights the limited utility of the agent as an empirical agent in our setting. Knowledge of local molecular epidemiology is crucial in determining the potential of therapy with novel agents. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is one of the most difficult health care-associated infections to treat due to the ability of the organism to acquire a multitude of resistance mechanisms and express the multidrug resistance phenotype. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T), a novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, addresses an unmet medical need in patients with these multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections. Our findings demonstrate geographical variation in C/T susceptibility owing to the distinct local molecular epidemiology. This study adds on to the growing knowledge of C/T resistance, particularly mutational resistance, and will aid in the design of future beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors. WGS proved to be a useful tool to understand the P. aeruginosa resistome and its contribution to emerging resistance in novel antimicrobial agents.
33504662/Complete Genome Sequencing of Acinetobacter baumannii AC1633 and Acinetobacter nosocomialis AC1530 Unveils a Large Multidrug-Resistant Plasmid Encoding the NDM-1 and OXA-58 Carbapenemases Bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter are important hospital-acquired pathogens, with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii listed by the World Health Organization as the one of the top priority pathogens. Whole-genome sequencing of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii AC1633 and A. nosocomialis AC1530, which were isolated from the main tertiary hospital in Terengganu, Malaysia, led to the discovery of a large, ca. 170-kb plasmid that harbored genes encoding the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) and OXA-58 carbapenemases alongside genes that conferred resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, and sulfonamides. ABSTRACT Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. are considered priority drug-resistant human-pathogenic bacteria. The genomes of two carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. clinical isolates obtained from the same tertiary hospital in Terengganu, Malaysia, namely, A. baumannii AC1633 and A. nosocomialis AC1530, were sequenced. Both isolates were found to harbor the carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-58 in a large (ca. 170 kb) plasmid designated pAC1633-1 and pAC1530, respectively, that also encodes genes that confer resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The two plasmids were almost identical except for the insertion of ISAba11 and an IS4 family element in pAC1633-1, and ISAba11 along with relBE toxin-antitoxin genes flanked by inversely orientated pdif (XerC/XerD) recombination sites in pAC1530. The blaNDM-1 gene was encoded in a Tn125 composite transposon structure flanked by ISAba125, whereas blaOXA-58 was flanked by ISAba11 and ISAba3 downstream and a partial ISAba3 element upstream within a pdif module. The presence of conjugative genes in plasmids pAC1633-1/pAC1530 and their discovery in two distinct species of Acinetobacter from the same hospital are suggestive of conjugative transfer, but mating experiments failed to demonstrate transmissibility under standard laboratory conditions. Comparative sequence analysis strongly inferred that pAC1633-1/pAC1530 was derived from two separate plasmids in an IS1006-mediated recombination or transposition event. A. baumannii AC1633 also harbored three other plasmids designated pAC1633-2, pAC1633-3, and pAC1633-4. Both pAC1633-3 and pAC1633-4 are cryptic plasmids, whereas pAC1633-2 is a 12,651-bp plasmid of the GR8/GR23 Rep3-superfamily group that encodes the tetA(39) tetracycline resistance determinant in a pdif module. IMPORTANCE Bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter are important hospital-acquired pathogens, with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii listed by the World Health Organization as the one of the top priority pathogens. Whole-genome sequencing of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii AC1633 and A. nosocomialis AC1530, which were isolated from the main tertiary hospital in Terengganu, Malaysia, led to the discovery of a large, ca. 170-kb plasmid that harbored genes encoding the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) and OXA-58 carbapenemases alongside genes that conferred resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, and sulfonamides. The plasmid was a patchwork of multiple mobile genetic elements and comparative sequence analysis indicated that it may have been derived from two separate plasmids through an IS1006-mediated recombination or transposition event. The presence of such a potentially transmissible plasmid encoding resistance to multiple antimicrobials warrants vigilance, as its spread to susceptible strains would lead to increasing incidences of antimicrobial resistance.
33588933/Anti-echinococcal effect of verapamil involving the regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II response in vitro and in a murine infection model Background Echinococcosis, which is caused by the larvae of cestodes of the genus Echinococcus, is a parasitic zoonosis that poses a serious threat to the health of humans and animals globally. Albendazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of echinococcosis, but it is difficult to meet clinical goals with this chemotherapy due to its low cure rate and associated side effects after its long-term use. Hence, novel anti-parasitic targets and effective treatment alternatives are urgently needed. A previous study showed that verapamil (Vepm) can suppress the growth of Echinococcus granulosus larvae; however, the mechanism of this effect remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the anti-echinococcal effect of Vepm on Echinococcus with a particular focus on the regulatory effect of Vepm on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII) in infected mice. Methods The anti-echinococcal effects of Vepm on Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces (PSC) in vitro and Echinococcus multilocularis metacestodes in infected mice were assessed. The morphological alterations in Echinococcus spp. induced by Vepm were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the changes in calcium content in both the parasite and mouse serum and liver were measured by SEM-energy dispersive spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and alizarin red staining. Additionally, the changes in the protein and mRNA levels of CaM and CaMKII in infected mice, and in the mRNA levels of CaMKII in E. granulosus PSC, were evaluated after treatment with Vepm by immunohistochemistry and/or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results In vitro, E. granulosus PSC could be killed by Vepm at a concentration of 0.5 mug/ml or higher within 8 days. Under these conditions, the ultrastructure of PSC was damaged, and this damage was accompanied by obvious calcium loss and downregulation of CaMKII mRNA expression. In vivo, the weight and the calcium content of E. multilocularis metacestodes from mice were reduced after treatment with 40 mg/kg Vepm, and an elevation of the calcium content in the sera and livers of infected mice was observed. In addition, downregulation of CaM and CaMKII protein and mRNA expression in the livers of mice infected with E. multilocularis metacestodes was found after treatment with Vepm. Conclusions Vepm exerted a parasiticidal effect against Echinococcus both in vitro and in vivo through downregulating the expression of Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII, which was over-activated by parasitic infection. The results suggest that Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII may be a novel drug target, and that Vepm is a potential anti-echinococcal drug for the future control of echinococcosis.
33588857/An optimized growth medium for increased recombinant protein secretion titer via the type III secretion system Background Protein secretion in bacteria is an attractive strategy for heterologous protein production because it retains the high titers and tractability of bacterial hosts while simplifying downstream processing. Traditional intracellular production strategies require cell lysis and separation of the protein product from the chemically similar cellular contents, often a multi-step process that can include an expensive refolding step. The type III secretion system of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium transports proteins from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment in a single step and is thus a promising solution for protein secretion in bacteria. Product titer is sensitive to extracellular environmental conditions, however, and T3SS regulation is integrated with essential cellular functions. Instead of attempting to untangle a complex web of regulatory input, we took an "outside-in" approach to elucidate the effect of growth medium components on secretion titer. Results We dissected the individual and combined effects of carbon sources, buffers, and salts in a rich nutrient base on secretion titer. Carbon sources alone decreased secretion titer, secretion titer increased with salt concentration, and the combination of a carbon source, buffer, and high salt concentration had a synergistic effect on secretion titer. Transcriptional activity measured by flow cytometry showed that medium composition affected secretion system activity, and prolonged secretion system activation correlated strongly with increased secretion titer. We found that an optimal combination of glycerol, phosphate, and sodium chloride provided at least a fourfold increase in secretion titer for a variety of proteins. Further, the increase in secretion titer provided by the optimized medium was additive with strain enhancements. Conclusions We leveraged the sensitivity of the type III secretion system to the extracellular environment to increase heterologous protein secretion titer. Our results suggest that maximizing secretion titer via the type III secretion system is not as simple as maximizing secreted protein expression:one must also optimize secretion system activity. This work advances the type III secretion system as a platform for heterologous protein secretion in bacteria and will form a basis for future engineering efforts.
33588824/Development of a novel nannochloropsis strain with enhanced violaxanthin yield for large-scale production Background  Nannochloropsis is a marine microalga that has been extensively studied. The major carotenoid produced by this group of microalgae is violaxanthin, which exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-photoaging, and antiproliferative activities. Therefore, it has a wide range of potential applications. However, large-scale production of this pigment has not been much studied, thereby limiting its industrial application. Results To develop a novel strain producing high amount of violaxanthin, various Nannochloropsis species were isolated from seawater samples and their violaxanthin production potential were compared. Of the strains tested, N. oceanica WS-1 exhibited the highest violaxanthin productivity; to further enhance the violaxanthin yield of WS-1, we performed gamma-ray-mediated random mutagenesis followed by colorimetric screening. As a result, Mutant M1 was selected because of its significant higher violaxanthin content and biomass productivity than WS-1 (5.21 +- 0.33 mg g- 1 and 0.2101 g L- 1 d- 1, respectively). Subsequently, we employed a 10 L-scale bioreactor to confirm the large-scale production potential of M1, and the results indicated a 43.54 % increase in violaxanthin production compared with WS-1. In addition, comparative transcriptomic analysis performed under normal light condition identified possible mechanisms associated with remediating photo-inhibitory damage and other key responses in M1, which seemed to at least partially explain enhanced violaxanthin content and delayed growth. Conclusions  Nannochloropsis oceanica mutant (M1) with enhanced violaxanthin content was developed and its physiological characteristics were investigated. In addition, enhanced production of violaxanthin was demonstrated in the large-scale cultivation. Key transcriptomic responses that are seemingly associated with different physiological responses of M1 were elucidated under normal light condition, the details of which would guide ongoing efforts to further maximize the industrial potential of violaxanthin producing strains.
33588774/Barriers and enablers of implementation of alcohol guidelines with pregnant women: a cross-sectional survey among UK midwives Background In 2016, the UK Chief Medical Officers revised their guidance on alcohol and advised women to abstain from alcohol if pregnant or planning pregnancy. Midwives have a key role in advising women about alcohol during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate UK midwives' practices regarding the 2016 Chief Medical Officers Alcohol Guidelines for pregnancy, and factors influencing their implementation during antenatal appointments. Methods Online cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of UK midwives recruited through professional networks and social media. Data were gathered using an anonymous online questionnaire addressing knowledge of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines for pregnancy; practice behaviours regarding alcohol assessment and advice; and questions based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to evaluate implementation of advising abstinence at antenatal booking and subsequent antenatal appointments. Results Of 842 questionnaire respondents, 58% were aware of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines of whom 91% (438) cited abstinence was recommended, although 19% (93) cited recommendations from previous guidelines. Nonetheless, 97% of 842 midwives always or usually advised women to abstain from alcohol at the booking appointment, and 38% at subsequent antenatal appointments. Mean TDF domain scores (range 1-7) for advising abstinence at subsequent appointments were highest (indicative of barriers) for social influences (3.65 sd 0.84), beliefs about consequences (3.16 sd 1.13) and beliefs about capabilities (3.03 sd 073); and lowest (indicative of facilitators) for knowledge (1.35 sd 0.73) and professional role and identity (1.46 sd 0.77). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the TDF domains: beliefs about capabilities (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.88), emotion (OR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.67, 0.90), and professional role and identity (OR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.51, 0.95) were strong predictors of midwives advising all women to abstain from alcohol at appointments other than at booking. Conclusions Our results suggest that skill development and reinforcement of support from colleagues and the wider maternity system could support midwives' implementation of alcohol advice at each antenatal appointment, not just at booking could lead to improved outcomes for women and infants. Implementation of alcohol care pathways in maternity settings are beneficial from a lifecourse perspective for women, children, families, and the wider community.

33588801/Prophylactic metformin after antenatal corticosteroids (PROMAC): a double blind randomized controlled trial Background Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) are increasingly used to improve prematurity-related neonatal outcome. A recognized and common adverse effect from administration of antenatal corticosteroid is maternal hyperglycemia. Even normal pregnancy is characterized by relative insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Treatment of maternal hyperglycemia after ACS might be indicated due to the higher risk of neonatal acidosis which may coincide with premature birth. Metformin is increasingly used to manage diabetes mellitus during pregnancy as it is effective and more patient friendly. There is no data on prophylactic metformin to maintain euglycemia following antenatal corticosteroids administration. Methods A double blind randomized trial. 103 women scheduled to receive two doses of 12-mg intramuscular dexamethasone 12-hour apart were separately randomized to take prophylactic metformin or placebo after stratification according to their gestational diabetes (GDM) status. First oral dose of allocated study drug was taken at enrolment and continued 500 mg twice daily for 72 hours if not delivered. Six-point blood sugar profiles were obtained each day (pre- and two-hour post breakfast, lunch and dinner) for up to three consecutive days. A hyperglycemic episode is defined as capillary glucose fasting/pre-meal >= 5.3 mmol/L or two-hour post prandial/meal >= 6.7 mmol/L. Primary outcome was hyperglycemic episodes on Day-1 (first six blood sugar profile points) following antenatal corticosteroids. Results Number of hyperglycemic episodes on the first day were not significantly different (mean +- standard deviation) 3.9 +- 1.4 (metformin) vs. 4.1 +- 1.6 (placebo) p = 0.64. Hyperglycemic episodes markedly reduced on second day in both arms to 0.9 +- 1.0 (metformin) vs. 1.2 +- 1.0 (placebo) p = 0.15 and further reduced to 0.6 +- 1.0 (metformin) vs. 0.7 +- 1.0 (placebo) p = 0.67 on third day. Hypoglycemic episodes during the 3-day study period were few and all other secondary outcomes were not significantly different. Conclusions In euglycemic and diet controllable gestational diabetes mellitus women, antenatal corticosteroids cause sustained maternal hyperglycemia only on Day-1. The magnitude of Day-1 hyperglycemia is generally low. Prophylactic metformin does not reduce antenatal corticosteroids' hyperglycemic effect. Trial registration The trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry on May 4 2017 with trial identifier 10.1186/ISRCTN10156101.
33588773/Perceived differences on the role of traditional birth attendants in rural Tanzania: a qualitative study Background In many low to middle income countries, traditional birth attendants (TBAs) play various roles (e.g., provision of health education, referral to hospitals, and delivery support) that can potentially improve women's access to healthcare. In Tanzania, however, the formal healthcare systems have not acknowleded the role of the TBAs. TBAs' contributions are limited and are not well described in policy documents. This study aimed to examine the perspectives of both TBAs and skilled birth attendants (SBAs) to clarify the role of TBAs and issues impacting their inclusion in rural Tanzania. Methods We used a qualitative descriptive design with triangulation of investigators, methods, and data sources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 TBAs and focus group discussions with 21 SBAs in Kiswahili language to ask about TBAs' activities and needs. The data obtained were recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Two researchers conducted the content analysis. Results Content analysis of data from both groups revealed TBAs' three primary roles: emergency delivery assistance, health education for the community, and referrals. Both TBAs and SBAs mentioned that one strength that the TBAs had was that they supported women based on the development of a close relationship with them. TBAs mentioned that, while they do not receive substantial remuneration, they experience joy/happiness in their role. SBAs indicated that TBAs sometimes did not refer women to the hospital for their own benefit. TBAs explained that the work issues they faced were mainly due to insufficient resources and unfavorable relationships with hospitals. SBAs were concerned that TBAs' lacked formal medical training and their actions could interfere with SBAs' professional work. Although there were no between-group interactions at the time of this study, both groups expressed willingness to collaborate/communicate to ensure the health and lives of mothers and babies. Conclusions TBAs and SBAs have different perceptions of TBAs' knowledge and skills, but agreed that TBAs need further training/inclusion. Such collaboration could help build trust, improve positive birth experiences of mothers in rural Tanzania, and promote nationwide universal access to maternal healthcare.

33628394/Resveratrol Suppresses Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Induced Microcirculation Disturbance through Targeting SIRT1-FOXO1 Axis Background  Resveratrol (RSV), one of the SIRT1 agonists, has the ability of alleviating severe acute pancreatitis (SAP); however, the concrete protective mechanism remains unknown. It is noteworthy that microcirculation disturbance plays a vital role in SAP, and the SIRT1/FOX1 axis can regulate microcirculation. Therefore, this study is aimed at ascertaining what is the underlying mechanism of the protective effect of RSV on SAP, and whether it is associated with alleviating microcirculation disturbance by regulating the SIRT1/FOX1 axis.  Method  The model of SAP was induced by retrograde injection of sodium taurodeoxycholate into the bile duct of the rats. The pancreatic wet/dry weight, ET/NO, and TXB2/6-keto-PGF1alpha ratios; microcirculatory function; and SIRT1 activity were examined. ELISA was used to examine the serum level of lipase, amylase, hemorheology, ET, NO, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1alpha and the content of SIRT1, VEGF, Ang I, and Ang II in the pancreas. RT-PCR was used to examine the mRNA level of VEGF, Ang I, and Ang II. Western blotting was used to detect SIRT1, FOXO1, and acetyl-FOXO1. Immunoprecipitation was used to examine the interaction of SIRT1 and FOXO1.  Results  Resveratrol can significantly decrease the expression of lipase, amylase, acetyl-FOXO1, VEGF, Ang II, ET, NO, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1alpha and the ratio of wet/dry weight, ET/NO, and TXB2/6-keto-PGF1alpha by improving microcirculatory dysfunction and blood viscosity in SAP. Moreover, resveratrol can also promote the interaction of SIRT1 and FOXO1 and increase SIRT1 activity and the expression of SIRT1 and Ang I. The SIRT1 inhibitor, Sirtinol (EX527), obliviously reversed the effects of RSV on SAP.  Conclusion  Resveratrol can protect rats against SAP, and its protective mechanism is associated with suppressing microcirculation disturbance through activating SIRT1-FOXO1 axis.
33596912/Synthesis, characterisation and cytotoxicity of gold microwires for ultra-sensitive biosensor development With the long-term goal of developing an ultra-sensitive microcantilever-based biosensor for versatile biomarker detection, new controlled bioreceptor-analytes systems are being explored to overcome the disadvantages of conventional ones. Gold (Au) microwires have been used as a probe to overcome the tolerance problem that occurs in response to changes in environmental conditions. However, the cytotoxicity of Au microwires is still unclear. Here, we examined the cytotoxicity of Au microwires systems using both commercial and as-synthesised Au microwires. In vitro experiments show that commercial Au microwires with an average quoted length of 5.6 microm are highly toxic against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 50 microg/mL. However, this toxicity is due to the presence of CTAB surfactant not by the microwires. Conversely, the as-synthesised Au microwires show non-cytotoxicity even at the maximum viable concentration (330 microg/mL). These findings may lead to the development of potentially life-saving cytotoxicity-free biosensors for an early diagnostic of potential diseases.
33596244/Effects of phosphorus deficiency on the absorption of mineral nutrients, photosynthetic system performance and antioxidant metabolism in Citrus grandis Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth, development and production. However, little is known about the effects of P deficiency on nutrient absorption, photosynthetic apparatus performance and antioxidant metabolism in citrus. Seedlings of 'sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) were irrigated with a nutrient solution containing 0.2 mM (Control) or 0 mM (P deficiency) KH2PO4 until saturated every other day for 16 weeks. P deficiency significantly decreased the dry weight (DW) of leaves and stems, and increased the root/shoot ratio in C. grandis but did not affect the DW of roots. The decreased DW of leaves and stems might be induced by the decreased chlorophyll (Chl) contents and CO2 assimilation in P deficient seedlings. P deficiency heterogeneously affected the nutrient contents of leaves, stems and roots. The analysis of Chl a fluorescence transients showed that P deficiency impaired electron transport from the donor side of photosystem II (PSII) to the end acceptor side of PSI, which showed a greater impact on the performance of the donor side of PSII than that of the acceptor side of PSII and photosystem I (PSI). P deficiency increased the contents of ascorbate (ASC), H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves. In contrast, P deficiency increased the ASC content, reduced the glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of SOD, CAT, APX and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), but did not increase H2O2 production, anthocyanins and MDA content in roots. Taking these results together, we conclude that P deficiency affects nutrient absorption and lowers photosynthetic performance, leading to ROS production, which might be a crucial cause of the inhibited growth of C. grandis.
33596255/Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses for finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.] in response to drought stress Drought is one of the most significant abiotic stresses that affects the growth and productivity of crops worldwide. Finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.] is a C4 crop with high nutritional value and drought tolerance. However, the drought stress tolerance genetic mechanism of finger millet is largely unknown. In this study, transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and proteomic (iTRAQ) technologies were combined to investigate the finger millet samples treated with drought at different stages to determine drought response mechanism. A total of 80,602 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 3,009 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, respectively. An integrated analysis, which combined transcriptome and proteome data, revealed the presence of 1,305 DEPs were matched with the corresponding DEGs (named associated DEGs-DEPs) when comparing the control to samples which were treated with 19 days of drought (N1-N2 comparison group), 1,093 DEGs-DEPs between control and samples which underwent rehydration treatment for 36 hours (N1-N3 comparison group) and 607 DEGs-DEPs between samples which were treated with drought for 19 days and samples which underwent rehydration treatment for 36 hours (N2-N3 comparison group). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis identified 80 DEGs-DEPs in the N1-N2 comparison group, 49 DEGs-DEPs in the N1-N3 comparison group, and 59 DEGs-DEPs in the N2-N3 comparison group, which were associated with drought stress. The DEGs-DEPs which were drought tolerance-related were enriched in hydrolase activity, glycosyl bond formation, oxidoreductase activity, carbohydrate binding and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Co-expression network analysis revealed two candidate DEGs-DEPs which were found to be centrally involved in drought stress response. These results suggested that the coordination of the DEGs-DEPs was essential to the enhanced drought tolerance response in the finger millet.
33628376/Ferroportin-Dependent Iron Homeostasis Protects against Oxidative Stress-Induced Nucleus Pulposus Cell Ferroptosis and Ameliorates Intervertebral Disc Degeneration In Vivo Ferroptosis is a specialized form of regulated cell death that is charactered by iron-dependent lethal lipid peroxidation, a process associated with multiple diseases. However, its role in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is rarely investigated. This study is aimed at investigating the role of ferroptosis in oxidative stress- (OS-) induced nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) decline and the pathogenesis of IVDD and determine the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We used tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) to simulate OS conditions around human NPCs. Flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy were used to identify ferroptosis, while iron assay kit, Perl's staining, and western blotting were performed to assay the intracellular iron levels. A ferroportin- (FPN-) lentivirus and FPN-siRNA were constructed and used to explore the relationship between FPN, intracellular iron homeostasis, and ferroptosis. Furthermore, hinokitiol, a bioactive compound known to specifically resist OS and restore FPN function, was evaluated for its therapeutic role in IVDD both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that intercellular iron overload plays an essential role in TBHP-induced ferroptosis of human NPCs. Mechanistically, FPN dysregulation is responsible for intercellular iron overload under OS. The increase in nuclear translocation of metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) restored the function of FPN, abolished the intercellular iron overload, and protected cells against ferroptosis. Additionally, hinokitiol enhanced the nuclear translocation of MTF1 by suppressing the JNK pathway and ameliorated the progression of IVDD in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ferroptosis and FPN dysfunction are involved in the NPC depletion and the pathogenesis of IVDD under OS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the protective role of FPN in ferroptosis of NPCs, suggesting its potential used as a novel therapeutic target against IVDD.
33628389/Crosstalk between Macrophages, T Cells, and Iron Metabolism in Tumor Microenvironment Leukocytes, including macrophages and T cells, represent key players in the human immune system, which plays a considerable role in the development and progression of tumors by immune surveillance or immune escape. Boosting the recruitment of leukocytes into the tumor microenvironment and promoting their antitumor responses have been hot areas of research in recent years. Although immunotherapy has manifested a certain level of success in some malignancies, the overall effectiveness is far from satisfactory. Iron is an essential trace element required in multiple, normal cellular processes, such as DNA synthesis and repair, cellular respiration, metabolism, and signaling, while dysregulated iron metabolism has been declared one of the metabolic hallmarks of malignant cancer cells. Furthermore, iron is implicated in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and elucidating the targeted regulation of iron metabolism may have the potential to benefit antitumor immunity and cancer treatment. In the present review, we briefly summarize the roles of leukocytes and iron metabolism in tumorigenesis, as well as their crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of immunotherapy with targeted regulation of iron and iron-dependent regulated cell death (ferroptosis) may be a focus of future research.
33628381/ Amauroderma rugosum Protects PC12 Cells against 6-OHDA-Induced Neurotoxicity through Antioxidant and Antiapoptotic Effects  Amauroderma rugosum (AR) is a dietary mushroom in the Ganodermataceae family whose pharmacological activity and medicinal value have rarely been reported. In this study, the antioxidant capacity and neuroprotective effects of AR were investigated. The aqueous extract of AR was confirmed to contain phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, and triterpenes. The results of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) and total antioxidant capacity assays revealed that AR extract scavenged reactive oxygen species. Moreover, AR extract decreased the cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In addition, 6-OHDA upregulated the expressions of proapoptotic proteins and downregulated the Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR- (mammalian target of rapamycin-) and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)/ERK- (extracellular signal-regulated kinases-) dependent signaling pathways. These effects of 6-OHDA were abolished or partially reversed by AR extract. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of AR in 6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells were significantly abolished by Akt and MEK inhibitor. Thus, AR extract possesses neuroprotective effects, probably through its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. These findings suggest the potential application of AR in the prevention or treatment of oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
33628395/Ca2+-Dependent Glucose Transport in Skeletal Muscle by Diphlorethohydroxycarmalol, an Alga Phlorotannin: In Vitro and In Vivo Study Diphlorethohydroxycarmalol (DPHC), a type of phlorotannin isolated from the marine alga Ishige okamurae, reportedly alleviates impaired glucose tolerance. However, the molecular mechanisms of DPHC regulatory activity and by which it exerts potential beneficial effects on glucose transport into skeletal myotubes to control glucose homeostasis remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DPHC on cytosolic Ca2+ levels and its correlation with blood glucose transport in skeletal myotubes in vitro and in vivo. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels upon DPHC treatment were evaluated in skeletal myotubes and zebrafish larvae by Ca2+ imaging using Fluo-4. We investigated the effect of DPHC on the blood glucose level and glucose transport pathway in a hyperglycemic zebrafish. DPHC was shown to control blood glucose levels by accelerating glucose transport; this effect was associated with elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels in skeletal myotubes. Moreover, the increased cytosolic Ca2+ level caused by DPHC can facilitate the Glut4/AMPK pathways of the skeletal muscle in activating glucose metabolism, thereby regulating muscle contraction through the regulation of expression of troponin I/C, CaMKII, and ATP. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of DPHC activity in skeletal myotubes, suggesting that increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels caused by DPHC can promote glucose transport into skeletal myotubes to modulate blood glucose levels, thus indicating the potential use of DPHC in the prevention of diabetes.
33596864/Oligosaccharides increase the genotoxic effect of colibactin produced by pks+ Escherichia coli strains Background Colibactin is a genotoxin that induces DNA double-strand breaks that may lead to carcinogenesis and is produced by Escherichia coli strains harboring the pks island. Human and animal studies have shown that colibactin-producing gut bacteria promote carcinogenesis and enhance the progression of colorectal cancer through cellular senescence and chromosomal abnormalities. In this study, we investigated the impact of prebiotics on the genotoxicity of colibactin-producing E. coli strains Nissle 1917 and NC101. Methods Bacteria were grown in medium supplemented with 20, 30 and 40 mg/mL of prebiotics inulin or galacto-oligosaccharide, and with or without 5 muM, 25 muM and 125 muM of ferrous sulfate. Colibactin expression was assessed by luciferase reporter assay for the clbA gene, essential for colibactin production, in E. coli Nissle 1917 and by RT-PCR in E. coli NC101. The human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2, was used to assess colibactin-induced megalocytosis by methylene blue binding assay and genotoxicity by gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence analysis. Results Inulin and galacto-oligosaccharide enhanced the expression of clbA in pks+ E. coli. However, the addition of 125 muM of ferrous sulfate inhibited the expression of clbA triggered by oligosaccharides. In the presence of either oligosaccharide, E. coli NC101 increased dysplasia and DNA double-strand breaks in Caco-2 cells compared to untreated cells. Conclusion Our results suggest that, in vitro, prebiotic oligosaccharides exacerbate DNA damage induced by colibactin-producing bacteria. Further studies are necessary to establish whether oligosaccharide supplementation may lead to increased colorectal tumorigenesis in animal models colonized with pks+ E. coli.

33596868/Cross-sectional association between vitamin B12 status and probable postpartum depression in Indian women Background Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient for neurological function, as it leads to the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, which is precursor of biologically active molecule S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM). Pregnancy is a state of increased demand and delayed postpartum repletion of nutrients may predispose women to depression. Methods We included women who visited the hospital at 6-weeks postpartum for a regular checkup. Inclusion criteria were age (18-50 years), and willingness to donate venous sample for analysis. Exclusion criteria included previous history of mood disorders or antidepressant medication use, and any systemic illness like hypothyroidism, epilepsy, diabetes, and hypertension. Based on EPDS score of 10 as a cutoff, 217 women with probable postpartum depression (PPD) and equal number of age and BMI matched controls were included. Plasma total vitamin B12, holotranscobalamin (holotc), homocysteine (hcy), methyl malonic acid (MMA), 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (THF), SAM and serotonin levels were estimated using commercially available ELISA kits. Combined B12 (cB12) score was calculated from study parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the risk of probable postpartum depression. Results Total vitamin B12 and combined B12 score were found to be significantly lower (p = 0.001) and MMA (p = 0.002) and 5-methyl THF (p < 0.001) levels were higher in women with probable depression than women without probable PPD. Women in the lowest vitamin B12 quartile had 4.53 times higher likelihood of probable postpartum depression (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that decreasing vitamin B12 (OR = 0.394; 95% CI: 0.189-0.822) and cB12 (OR = 0.293; 95% CI: 0182-0.470) and increasing MMA (OR = 2.14; 95% CI: 1.63-2.83) and 5-methyl THF levels (OR = 3.29; 95% CI: 1.59-6.83) were significantly associated with the risk of probable PPD. Conclusion Low vitamin B12 may contribute to depressive symptoms in vulnerable postpartum period.
33596850/Following cytotoxic nanoconjugates from injection to halting the cell cycle machinery and its therapeutic implications in oral cancer Background The concept of personalized therapy has been proven to be a promising approach. A popular technique is to utilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as drug delivery vectors for cytotoxic drugs and small molecule inhibitors to target and eradicate oral cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Both drug and nanocarrier designs play important roles in the treatment efficacy. In our study, we standardized the nanosystem regarding NPs type, size, surface ligands and coverage percentage leaving only the drugs mode of action as the confounding variable. We propose that similarly constructed nanoparticles (NPs) can selectively leverage different conjugated drugs irrelevant to their original mode of action. If proven, AuNPs may have a secondary role beyond bypassing cancer cell membrane and delivering their loaded drugs. Methods We conjugated 5- fluorouracil (5Fu), camptothecin (CPT), and a fibroblast growth factor receptor1-inhibitor (FGFR1i) to gold nanospheres (AuNSs). We followed their trajectories in Syrian hamsters with chemically induced buccal carcinomas. Results Flow cytometry and cell cycle data shows that 5Fu- and CPT- induced a similar ratio of S-phase cell cycle arrest as nanoconjugates and in their free forms. On the other hand, FGFR1i-AuNSs induced significant sub-G1 cell population compared with its free form. Despite cell cycle dynamics variability, there was no significant difference in tumor cells' proliferation rate between CPT-, 5Fu- and FGFR1i- AuNSs treated groups. In our in vivo model, FGFR1i-AuNSs induced the highest tumor reduction rates followed by 5Fu- AuNSs. CPT-AuNSs induced significantly lower tumor reduction rates compared with the 5Fu- and FGFR1i- AuNSs despite showing similar proliferative rates in tumor cells. Conclusions Our data indicates that the cellular biological events do not predict the outcome seen in our in vivo model. Furthermore, our results suggest that AuNSs selectively enhance the therapeutic effect of small molecule inhibitors such as FGFR1i than potent anticancer drugs. Future studies are required to better understand the underlying mechanism.
33596836/Integrated metabolic profiling and transcriptome analysis of pigment accumulation in Lonicera japonica flower petals during colour-transition Background Plants have remarkable diversity in petal colour through the biosynthesis and accumulation of various pigments. To better understand the mechanisms regulating petal pigmentation in Lonicera japonica, we used multiple approaches to investigate the changes in carotenoids, anthocyanins, endogenous hormones and gene expression dynamics during petal colour transitions, i.e., green bud petals (GB_Pe), white flower petals (WF_Pe) and yellow flower petals (YF_Pe). Results Metabolome analysis showed that YF_Pe contained a much higher content of carotenoids than GB_Pe and WF_Pe, with alpha-carotene, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin and gamma-carotene identified as the major carotenoid compounds in YF_Pe. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, such as phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase and zeta-carotene desaturase, were significantly upregulated in YF_Pe. The results indicated that upregulated carotenoid concentrations and carotenoid biosynthesis-related genes predominantly promote colour transition. Meanwhile, two anthocyanins (pelargonidin and cyanidin) were significantly increased in YF_Pe, and the expression level of an anthocyanidin synthase gene was significantly upregulated, suggesting that anthocyanins may contribute to vivid yellow colour in YF_Pe. Furthermore, analyses of changes in indoleacetic acid, zeatin riboside, gibberellic acid, brassinosteroid (BR), methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid (ABA) levels indicated that colour transitions are regulated by endogenous hormones. The DEGs involved in the auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, BR, jasmonic acid and ABA signalling pathways were enriched and associated with petal colour transitions. Conclusion Our results provide global insight into the pigment accumulation and the regulatory mechanisms underlying petal colour transitions during the flower development process in L. japonica.

33596851/Reprogramming of glutamine metabolism via glutamine synthetase silencing induces cisplatin resistance in A2780 ovarian cancer cells Background Cisplatin (CDDP) significantly prolongs survival in various cancers, but many patients also develop resistance that results in treatment failure. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which ovarian cancer cells acquire CDDP resistance. Methods We evaluated the metabolic profiles in CDDP-sensitive ovarian cancer A2780 cells and CDDP-resistant A2780cis cells using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). We further examined the expression of glutamine metabolism enzymes using real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Cell viability was accessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results The results showed that levels of glutamine, glutamate, and glutathione (GSH), a key drug resistance mediator synthesized from glutamate, were significantly elevated in A2780cis cells than those in A2780 cells. Furthermore, glutamine starvation decreased the GSH levels and CDDP resistance in A2780cis cells. Interestingly, the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS/GLUL), which synthesizes glutamine from glutamate and thereby negatively regulates GSH production, was almost completely suppressed in resistant A2780cis cells. In addition, treatment of A2780cis cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA-demethylating agent, restored GS expression and reduced CDDP resistance. In contrast, GS knockdown in CDDP-sensitive A2780 cells induced CDDP resistance. Conclusions The results indicate that upregulation of GSH synthesis from glutamine via DNA methylation-mediated silencing of GS causes CDDP resistance in A2780cis cells. Therefore, glutamine metabolism could be a novel therapeutic target against CDDP resistance.

33596923/Construction and comprehensive characterization of an EcLDCc-CatIB set:varying linkers and aggregation inducing tags Background  In recent years, the production of inclusion bodies that retained substantial catalytic activity was demonstrated. These catalytically active inclusion bodies (CatIBs) were formed by genetic fusion of an aggregation inducing tag to a gene of interest via short linker polypeptides and overproduction of the resulting gene fusion in Escherichia coli. The resulting CatIBs are known for their high stability, easy and cost efficient production, and recyclability and thus provide an interesting alternative to conventionally immobilized enzymes. Results Here, we present the construction and characterization of a CatIB set of the lysine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli (EcLDCc), constructed via Golden Gate Assembly. A total of ten EcLDCc variants consisting of combinations of two linker and five aggregation inducing tag sequences were generated. A flexible Serine/Glycine (SG)- as well as a rigid Proline/Threonine (PT)-Linker were tested in combination with the artificial peptides (18AWT, L6KD and GFIL8) or the coiled-coil domains (TDoT and 3HAMP) as aggregation inducing tags. The linkers were fused to the C-terminus of the EcLDCc to form a linkage between the enzyme and the aggregation inducing tags. Comprehensive morphology and enzymatic activity analyses were performed for the ten EcLDCc-CatIB variants and a wild type EcLDCc control to identify the CatIB variant with the highest activity for the decarboxylation of l-lysine to 1,5-diaminopentane. Interestingly, all of the CatIB variants possessed at least some activity, whilst most of the combinations with the rigid PT-Linker showed the highest conversion rates. EcLDCc-PT-L6KD was identified as the best of all variants allowing a volumetric productivity of 457 g L- 1 d- 1 and a specific volumetric productivity of 256 g L- 1 d- 1 gCatIB-1. Noteworthy, wild type EcLDCc, without specific aggregation inducing tags, also partially formed CatIBs, which, however showed lower activity compared to most of the newly constructed CatIB variants (volumetric productivity: 219 g L- 1 d- 1, specific volumetric activity: 106 g L- 1 d- 1 gCatIB- 1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that microscopic analysis can serve as a tool to find CatIB producing strains and thus allow for prescreening at an early stage to save time and resources. Conclusions Our results clearly show that the choice of linker and aggregation inducing tag has a strong influence on the morphology and the enzymatic activity of the CatIBs. Strikingly, the linker had the most pronounced influence on these characteristics.
33596930/Bacillus aryabhattai TFG5-mediated synthesis of humic substances from coir pith wastes Background Humic substances (HS) form the largest proportion among all the constituents of soil organic matter and are a key component of the terrestrial ecosystem. HS plays a multifunctional role in the environment by controlling the biogeochemical carbon cycle, providing nutrients and bio-stimulants for plant growth, and interacting with inorganic and organic pollutants. The rate of formation of HS in soils determines its productivity and carbon sequestration capacity. Enhancement of HS synthesis in the soil through the microbial route not only increases CO2 sequestration but also mitigates the greenhouse gas emissions in the environment. Result In this study, we attempted to understand the mechanism of formation and enhancement of HS from coir pith wastes using the tyrosinase produced by Bacillus aryabhattai TFG5. The bacterium TFG5 isolated from the termite garden produced the tyrosinase (1.34 U mL-1) and laccase (2.1 U mL-1) at 48 h and 60 h of fermentation, respectively. The extracellular tyrosinase from B. aryabhattai TFG5 was designated as TyrB. Homology modeling of TyrB revealed a structure with a predicted molecular mass of 35.23 kDa and two copper ions in the active center with its conserved residues required for the tyrosinase activity. TyrB efficiently transformed and polymerized standard phenols, such as p-cresol, p-hydroxyl benzoic acid, Levo DOPA, and 2,6 DMP, besides transforming free phenols in coir pith wash water (CWW). Additionally, UV-Vis and FT-IR spectra of the degradation products of the coir pith treated with TyrB revealed the formation of HS within 3 days of incubation. Furthermore, the E472/664 ratio of the degradation products revealed a higher degree of condensation of the aromatic carbons and the presence of more aliphatic structures in the HS. Conclusion The results confirmed the influence of TyrB for the effective synthesis of HS from coir pith wastes. The results of the present study also confirm the recently accepted theory of humification proposed by the International Humic Substances Society.
33600468/Secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid alters weight, the gut microbiota, and the bile acid pool in conventional mice Ursodeoxycholic acid (commercially available as ursodiol) is a naturally occurring bile acid that is used to treat a variety of hepatic and gastrointestinal diseases. Ursodiol can modulate bile acid pools, which have the potential to alter the gut microbiota community structure. In turn, the gut microbial community can modulate bile acid pools, thus highlighting the interconnectedness of the gut microbiota-bile acid-host axis. Despite these interactions, it remains unclear if and how exogenously administered ursodiol shapes the gut microbial community structure and bile acid pool in conventional mice. This study aims to characterize how ursodiol alters the gastrointestinal ecosystem in conventional mice. C57BL/6J wildtype mice were given one of three doses of ursodiol (50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 21 days. Alterations in the gut microbiota and bile acids were examined including stool, ileal, and cecal content. Bile acids were also measured in serum. Significant weight loss was seen in mice treated with the low and high dose of ursodiol. Alterations in the microbial community structure and bile acid pool were seen in ileal and cecal content compared to pretreatment, and longitudinally in feces following the 21-day ursodiol treatment. In both ileal and cecal content, members of the Lachnospiraceae Family significantly contributed to the changes observed. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive view of how exogenously administered ursodiol shapes the healthy gastrointestinal ecosystem in conventional mice. Further studies to investigate how these changes in turn modify the host physiologic response are important.
33600440/Sensitivity of wild-type and rifampicin-resistant O157 and non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli to elevated hydrostatic pressure and lactic acid in ground meat and meat homogenate Various serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli have been epidemiologically associated with foodborne disease episodes in the United States and around the globe, with E. coli O157: H7 as the dominant serogroup of public health concern. Serogroups other than O157 are currently associated with about 60% of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli related foodborne illness episodes. Current study evaluated sensitivity of the O157 and epidemiologically important non-O157 serogroups of the pathogen to elevated hydrostatic pressure and 1% lactic acid. Pressure intensity of 250 to 650 MPa were applied for 0 to 7 min for inactivation of strain mixtures of wild-type and rifampicin-resistant E. coli O157, as well as O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145 serogroups and ATCC  43895  strain in ground meat and 10% meat homogenate. E. coli O157 were reduced (p < 0.05) from 6.86 +- 0.2 to 4.56 +- 0.1 log CFU/g when exposed to pressure of 650 MPa for 7 min. Corresponding reductions (p < 0.05) for non-O157 E. coli were from 6.98 +- 0.3 to 4.72 +- 0.1. The D-values at 650 MPa were 3.71 and 3.47 min for O157 and non-O157 serogroups, respectively. Presence of 1% lactic acid to a great extent augmented (p < 0.05) decontamination efficacy of the treatment in meat homogenate resulting in up to 5.6 and 6.0 log CFU/mL reductions for O157 and non-O157 serogroups, respectively. Among the tested serogroups, the wild-type and rifampicin-resistant phenotypes exhibited (p >= 0.05) comparable pressure sensitivity. Thus, these two phenotypes could be used interchangeably in validation studies. Our results also illustrate that, application of elevated hydrostatic pressure could be utilized for assuring safety of ground and non-intact meat products against various serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Addition of 1% lactic acid additionally provided industrially appreciable augmentation in efficacy of the pressure-based treatments.
33602297/Assessing cross-resistance within the pyrethroids in terms of their interactions with key cytochrome P450 enzymes and resistance in vector populations Background It is important to understand whether the potential impact of pyrethroid resistance on malaria control can be mitigated by switching between different pyrethroids or whether cross-resistance within this insecticide class precludes this approach. Methods Here we assess the relationships among pyrethroids in terms of their binding affinity to, and depletion by, key cytochrome P450 enzymes (hereafter P450s) that are known to confer metabolic pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) and An. funestus, in order to identify which pyrethroids may diverge from the others in their vulnerability to resistance. We then investigate whether these same pyrethroids also diverge from the others in terms of resistance in vector populations. Results We found that the type I and II pyrethroids permethrin and deltamethrin, respectively, are closely related in terms of binding affinity to key P450s, depletion by P450s and resistance within vector populations. Bifenthrin, which lacks the common structural moiety of most pyrethroids, diverged from the other pyrethroids tested in terms of both binding affinity to key P450s and depletion by P450s, but resistance to bifenthrin has rarely been tested in vector populations and was not analysed here. Etofenprox, which also lacks the common structural moiety of most pyrethroids, diverged from the more commonly deployed pyrethroids in terms of binding affinity to key P450s and resistance in vector populations, but did not diverge from these pyrethroids in terms of depletion by the P450s. The analysis of depletion by the P450s indicated that etofenprox may be more vulnerable to metabolic resistance mechanisms in vector populations. In addition, greater resistance to etofenprox was found across Aedes aegypti populations, but greater resistance to this compound was not found in any of the malaria vector species analysed. The results for pyrethroid depletion by anopheline P450s in the laboratory were largely not repeated in the findings for resistance in malaria vector populations. Conclusion  Importantly, the prevalence of resistance to the pyrethroids alpha-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and permethrin was correlated across malaria vector populations, and switching between these compounds as a tool to mitigate against pyrethroid resistance is not advised without strong evidence supporting a true difference in resistance.
33602120/Genome-wide association of rice response to blast fungus identifies loci for robust resistance under high nitrogen Background Nitrogen fertilization is known to increase disease susceptibility, a phenomenon called Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility (NIS). In rice, this phenomenon has been observed in infections with the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. A previous classical genetic study revealed a locus (NIS1) that enhances susceptibility to rice blast under high nitrogen fertilization. In order to further address the underlying genetics of plasticity in susceptibility to rice blast after fertilization, we analyzed NIS under greenhouse-controlled conditions in a panel of 139 temperate japonica rice strains. A genome-wide association analysis was conducted to identify loci potentially involved in NIS by comparing susceptibility loci identified under high and low nitrogen conditions, an approach allowing for the identification of loci validated across different nitrogen environments. We also used a novel NIS Index to identify loci potentially contributing to plasticity in susceptibility under different nitrogen fertilization regimes. Results A global NIS effect was observed in the population, with the density of lesions increasing by 8%, on average, under high nitrogen fertilization. Three new QTL, other than NIS1, were identified. A rare allele of the RRobN1 locus on chromosome 6 provides robust resistance in high and low nitrogen environments. A frequent allele of the NIS2 locus, on chromosome 5, exacerbates blast susceptibility under the high nitrogen condition. Finally, an allele of NIS3, on chromosome 10, buffers the increase of susceptibility arising from nitrogen fertilization but increases global levels of susceptibility. This allele is almost fixed in temperate japonicas, as a probable consequence of genetic hitchhiking with a locus involved in cold stress adaptation. Conclusions Our results extend to an entire rice subspecies the initial finding that nitrogen increases rice blast susceptibility. We demonstrate the usefulness of estimating plasticity for the identification of novel loci involved in the response of rice to the blast fungus under different nitrogen regimes.

33628361/Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Is a Promising Method to Restore Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Relieve Neurological Deficits after Traumatic Brain Injury Background  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can induce persistent fluctuation in the gut microbiota makeup and abundance. The present study is aimed at determining whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can rescue microbiota changes and ameliorate neurological deficits after TBI in rats.  Methods  A controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was used to simulate TBI in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and FMT was performed for 7 consecutive days. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing of fecal samples was performed to analyze the effects of FMT on gut microbiota. Modified neurological severity score and Morris water maze were used to evaluate neurobehavioral functions. Metabolomics was used to screen differential metabolites from the rat serum and ipsilateral brains. The oxidative stress indices were measured in the brain.  Results  TBI induced significance changes in the gut microbiome, including the alpha- and beta-bacterial diversity, as well as the microbiome composition at 8 days after TBI. On the other hand, FMT could rescue these changes and relieve neurological deficits after TBI. Metabolomics results showed that the level of trimethylamine (TMA) in feces and the level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the ipsilateral brain and serum was increased after TBI, while FMT decreased TMA levels in the feces, and TMAO levels in the ipsilateral brain and serum. Antioxidant enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) in the ipsilateral hippocampus was decreased after TBI but increased after FMT. In addition, FMT elevated SOD and CAT activities and GSH/GSSG ratio and diminished ROS, GSSG, and MDA levels in the ipsilateral hippocampus after TBI.  Conclusions  FMT can restore gut microbiota dysbiosis and relieve neurological deficits possibly through the TMA-TMAO-MsrA signaling pathway after TBI.
33606722/Characterizing tramadol users with potentially inappropriate co-medications: A latent class analysis among older adults Background Although tramadol is an effective weak opioid analgesic, careful monitoring of potential central nervous system adverse reactions in older adults is needed, especially when used with concomitant medications which may trigger the adverse effects. We aimed to characterize tramadol users with potentially inappropriate co-medications in older adults using a latent class analysis (LCA). Method Patients aged 65 years or older using tramadol and receiving potentially inappropriate co-medications were included from a nationwide healthcare claims database. We defined antidepressants, first-generation antihistamines, and anxiolytics as potentially inappropriate co-medications. We applied an LCA for grouping tramadol users based on the common characteristics of medication use and healthcare utilization, and each patient was probabilistically assigned to a class. Patients' characteristics in different latent classes were compared. Potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was defined as the any visits for emergency department after the occurrence of potentially inappropriate co-medications. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between latent classes and potential ADRs. Results We identified four distinct latent classes of tramadol users representing different patterns of co-medications: multiple potential drug-drug interaction (pDDI) combination users, antihistamines-tramadol users, antidepressants-tramadol users, and anxiolytics-tramadol users. Multiple pDDI combination users showed high proportion of regular tramadol use, tended to visit more medical institutions, and had a high Charlson comorbidity score. The duration of use of potentially inappropriate co-medications with tramadol was the longest in multiple pDDI combination users and the shortest in antihistamines-tramadol users. When compared with antihistamines-tramadol users, increased potential ADR risk was observed in multiple pDDI combination users (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75-1.88), antidepressants-tramadol users (1.24; 1.19-1.29), and anxiolytics-tramadol users (1.04; 1.00-1.08). Conclusions Four distinct classes were identified among older adults using tramadol and potentially inappropriate co-medications. Differences in potential ADR risk were observed between these classes. These findings may help to identify patients at a high risk for ADRs owing to potentially inappropriate co-medications with tramadol.
33606677/Imeglimin amplifies glucose-stimulated insulin release from diabetic islets via a distinct mechanism of action Pancreatic islet beta-cell dysfunction is characterized by defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and is a predominant component of the pathophysiology of diabetes. Imeglimin, a novel first-in-class small molecule tetrahydrotriazine drug candidate, improves glycemia and GSIS in preclinical models and clinical trials in patients with Type 2 diabetes; however, the mechanism by which it restores beta-cell function is unknown. Here, we show that imeglimin acutely and directly amplifies GSIS in islets isolated from rodents with Type 2 diabetes via a mode of action that is distinct from other known therapeutic approaches. The underlying mechanism involves increases in the cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pool:potentially via the salvage pathway and induction of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) along with augmentation of glucose-induced ATP levels. Further, additional results suggest that NAD+ conversion to a second messenger, cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), via ADP ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase (CD38) is required for imeglimin's effects in islets, thus representing a potential link between increased NAD+ and enhanced glucose-induced Ca2+ mobilization which:in turn:is known to drive insulin granule exocytosis. Collectively, these findings implicate a novel mode of action for imeglimin that explains its ability to effectively restore:beta-cell function and provides for a new approach to treat patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes.
33606762/Serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level in general Korean population and its relationship with other vitamin D biomarkers Background Vitamin D status is presently assessed by measuring total serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. However, 25(OH)D concentration alone might not accurately reflect vitamin D status owing to its weak relationship with various clinical indices and inconsistency across races. Recently, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)2D] and vitamin D metabolite ratio [VMR; ratio of 24,25(OH)2D to 25(OH)D] have emerged as vitamin D biomarkers. The present study aimed to determine the values of 24,25(OH)2D and VMR in healthy Koreans and compare them with other vitamin D biomarkers, including 25(OH)D and bioavailable 25(OH)D. Methods Serum samples and medical information were collected from 200 individuals (100 females and 100 males) who underwent general health checks without self-reported symptoms. We measured 24,25(OH)2D concentration using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and concentrations of 25(OH)D and vitamin D binding protein using immunoassays. VMR and bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration were calculated using the above data. Serum parathyroid hormone level, and bone mineral density (BMD) data were collected as clinical outcomes, and the effects of the vitamin D markers on them were tested using multiple linear regression models. Results The mean values of 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, VMR, and bioavailable 25(OH)D were 24.3 +- 8.5 ng/mL, 1.9 +- 1.1 ng/mL, 7.6 +- 2.5, and 3.2 +- 1.2 ng/mL, respectively. The concentration of 25(OH)D closely correlated with 24,25(OH)2D (R = 0.868, P < 0.001) and bioavailable 25(OH)D (R = 0.862, P < 0.001). No significant effects of 24,25(OH)2D, VMR, and bioavailable 25(OH)D were observed on the prediction of PTH and BMD in the multiple linear regression models. Conclusion Our study presents the distribution of 24,25(OH)2D concentration and VMR in Korean population for the first time. Overall, our data reaffirm that 25(OH)D is the primary marker for determining vitamin D status in the general population.
33606769/Transcriptomic analysis elucidates the molecular processes associated with hydrogen peroxide-induced diapause termination in Artemia-encysted embryos Treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) raises the hatching rate through the development and diapause termination of Artemia cysts. To comprehend the upstream genetic regulation of diapause termination activated by exterior H2O2 elements, an Illumina RNA-seq analysis was performed to recognize and assess comparative transcript amounts to explore the genetic regulation of H2O2 in starting the diapause termination of cysts in Artemia salina. We examined three groupings treated with no H2O2 (control), 180 muM H2O2 (low) and 1800 muM H2O2 (high). The results showed a total of 114,057 unigenes were identified, 41.22% of which were functionally annotated in at least one particular database. When compared to control group, 34 and 98 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated in 180 muM and 1800 muM H2O2 treatments, respectively. On the other hand, 162 and 30 DEGs were downregulated in the 180 muM and 1800 muM H2O2 treatments, respectively. Cluster analysis of DEGs demonstrated significant patterns among these types of 3 groups. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed the DEGs involved in the regulation of blood coagulation (GO: 0030193; GO: 0050818), regulation of wound healing (GO:0061041), regulation of hemostasis (GO: 1900046), antigen processing and presentation (KO04612), the Hippo signaling pathway (KO04391), as well as the MAPK signaling pathway (KO04010). This research helped to define the diapause-related transcriptomes of Artemia cysts using RNA-seq technology, which might fill up a gap in the prevailing body of knowledge.
33606778/Spatial mapping of soil properties in Konkan region of India experiencing anthropogenic onslaught Soils of Indian Konkan region, part of ecologically sensitive Western Ghats have been subjected to anthropogenic activities of late. This has endangered the ecological security through conspicuous losses in topsoil quality. The rationale of the present study was to map the soil properties and create management zones for ensuring food and nutritional security. The study was conducted in South Goa district of the state of Goa located in Konkan region. A total of 258 geo-referenced soil samples were collected and analyzed for pH, EC, SOC, available N, P, K and DTPA extractable micronutrients viz., Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn. Soil pH was found to be in acidic range. A wide variability existed in SOC content ranging from 0.12-5.85%. EC was mostly neutral with mean value 0.08+-0.37 dSm-1, while available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) varied in range from 56.4-621.6 kg ha-1, 0.5-49.7 kg ha-1 and 31.5-786.2 kg ha-1 with mean values 211.2+-76.9, 8.4+-8.2 and 202.3+-137.6 kg ha-1, respectively. A wide range was exhibited by cationic DTPA extractable Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn with mean values, 0.22+-0.30, 0.44+-0.60, 7.78+-5.98 and 7.86+-5.86 mg kg-1, respectively. Soil pH exhibited significant positive correlation with EC, AP AK and Zn and negative correlation with Fe and Cu. SOC exhibited significantly correlated with AN, AP, AK, Zn and Fe. Geo-statistical analysis revealed J-Bessel as best fit semivariogram model for pH, AP and AK; Rational Quadratic for EC, SOC, Zn and Mn; Hole effect for AN; Stable for Cu and K-Bessel for Fe for their spatial mapping. Four principal components showed eigenvalues more than one and cumulative variability of 59.38%. Three distinct soil management zones showing significant variation in soil properties were identified and delineated for wider scale management of soils. Precision nutrient management based on spatial variation and their mapping would enable refined agricultural and environmental management practices in the region.
33606763/Protective effects of dapagliflozin against oxidative stress-induced cell injury in human proximal tubular cells Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in type 2 diabetes cause cellular damage in many organs. Recently, the new class of glucose-lowering agents, SGLT-2 inhibitors, have been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetic complications; however, the mechanisms of such beneficial effect are largely unknown. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on cell proliferation and cell death under oxidative stress conditions and explore its underlying mechanisms. Human proximal tubular cells (HK-2) were used. Cell growth and death were monitored by cell counting, water-soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, and flow cytometry. The cytosolic and mitochondrial (ROS) production was measured using fluorescent probes (H2DCFDA and MitoSOX) under normal and oxidative stress conditions mimicked by addition of H2O2. Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics was monitored by FlexStation 3 using cell-permeable Ca2+ dye Fura-PE3/AM. Dapagliflozin (0.1-10 muM) had no effect on HK-2 cell proliferation under normal conditions, but an inhibitory effect was seen at an extreme high concentration (100 muM). However, dapagliflozin at 0.1 to 5 muM showed remarkable protective effects against H2O2-induced cell injury via increasing the viable cell number at phase G0/G1. The elevated cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS under oxidative stress was significantly decreased by dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin increased the basal intracellular [Ca2+]i in proximal tubular cells, but did not affect calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum and store-operated Ca2+ entry. The H2O2-sensitive TRPM2 channel seemed to be involved in the Ca2+ dynamics regulated by dapagliflozin. However, dapagliflozin had no direct effects on ORAI1, ORAI3, TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. Our results suggest that dapagliflozin shows anti-oxidative properties by reducing cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production and altering Ca2+ dynamics, and thus exerts its protective effects against cell damage under oxidative stress environment.
33606706/Effects of parity, blood progesterone, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment on the dynamics of the uterine microbiota of healthy postpartum dairy cows This study evaluated the effects of treatment with meloxicam (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), parity, and blood progesterone concentration on the dynamics of the uterine microbiota of 16 clinically healthy postpartum dairy cows. Seven primiparous and 9 multiparous postpartum Holstein cows either received meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg SC, n = 7 cows) once daily for 4 days (10 to 13 days in milk (DIM)) or were untreated (n = 9 cows). Endometrial cytology samples were collected by cytobrush at 10, 21, and 35 DIM, from which the microbiota analysis was conducted using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A radioimmunoassay was used to measure progesterone concentration in blood serum samples at 35 DIM and cows were classified as   1 ng/mL (n = 10) or <= 1 ng/mL (n = 6). Alpha diversity for bacterial genera (Chao1, Shannon-Weiner, and Camargo's evenness indices) were not affected by DIM, meloxicam treatment, parity, or progesterone category. For beta diversity (genera level), principal coordinate analysis (Bray-Curtis) showed differences in microbiota between parity groups. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was greater in primiparous than multiparous cows. At the genus level, there was lesser relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Neisseriaceae, Paracoccus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus and greater relative abundance of Bacillus and Fusobacterium in primiparous than multiparous cows. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity did not differ by DIM at sampling, meloxicam treatment, or progesterone category at 35 DIM. In conclusion, uterine bacterial composition was not different at 10, 21, or 35 DIM, and meloxicam treatment or progesterone category did not affect the uterine microbiota in clinically healthy postpartum dairy cows. Primiparous cows presented a different composition of uterine bacteria than multiparous cows. The differences in microbiota associated with parity might be attributable to changes that occur consequent to the first calving, but this hypothesis should be investigated further.
33628375/The Beneficial Role of Filipendula ulmaria Extract in Prevention of Prodepressant Effect and Cognitive Impairment Induced by Nanoparticles of Calcium Phosphates in Rats Mineral components of dental composites are used in many medical and dental applications, including preventive, restorative, and regenerative dentistry. To evaluate the behavioural alterations induced by nanosized particles of novel dental composites, by means of depressive level and cognitive functions, experimental groups of rats were chronically administered with nanosized hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) with or without simultaneous application of Filipendula ulmaria L. (FU) methanolic extract. The significant prodepressant action was observed in groups solely treated with HA and ACP. Besides, prolonged treatment with ACP also resulted in a significant decline in cognitive functions estimated in the novel object recognition test. The adverse impact of calcium phosphates on estimated behavioural functions was accompanied by increased oxidative damage and apoptotic markers in the prefrontal cortex, as well as diminished specific neurotrophin (BDNF) and gabaergic expression. The results of our investigation showed that simultaneous antioxidant supplementation with FU extract prevented calcium phosphate-induced behavioural disturbances, as well as prooxidative and apoptotic actions, with the simultaneous restoration of BDNF and GABA-A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that FU may be useful in the prevention of prodepressant impact and cognitive decline as early as the manifestation of calcium phosphate-induced neurotoxicity.
33628369/Dexmedetomidine Alleviates Hypoxia-Induced Synaptic Loss and Cognitive Impairment via Inhibition of Microglial NOX2 Activation in the Hippocampus of Neonatal Rats Background  Perinatal hypoxia is a universal cause of death and neurological deficits in neonates worldwide. Activation of microglial NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) leads to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which may contribute to hypoxic damage in the developing brain. Dexmedetomidine has been reported to exert potent neuroprotection in several neurological diseases, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated whether dexmedetomidine acts through microglial NOX2 to reduce neonatal hypoxic brain damage.  Methods  The potential role of microglial NOX2 in dexmedetomidine-mediated alleviation of hypoxic damage was evaluated in cultured BV2 microglia and neonatal rats subjected to hypoxia. In vivo, neonatal rats received dexmedetomidine (25 mug/kg, i.p.) 30 min before or immediately after hypoxia (5% O2, 2 h). Apocynin-mediated NOX inhibition and lentivirus-mediated NOX2 overexpression were applied to further assess the involvement of microglial NOX2 activation.  Results  Pre- or posttreatment with dexmedetomidine alleviated hypoxia-induced cognitive impairment, restored damaged synapses, and increased postsynaptic density-95 and synaptophysin protein expression following neonatal hypoxia. Importantly, dexmedetomidine treatment suppressed hypoxia-induced microglial NOX2 activation and subsequent oxidative stress and the neuroinflammatory response, as reflected by reduced 4-hydroxynonenal and ROS accumulation, and decreased nuclear NF-kappaB p65 and proinflammatory cytokine levels in cultured BV2 microglia and the developing hippocampus. In addition, treating primary hippocampal neurons with conditioned medium (CM) from hypoxia-activated BV2 microglia resulted in neuronal damage, which was alleviated by CM from dexmedetomidine-treated microglia. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine was reversed in NOX2-overexpressing BV2 microglia and diminished in apocynin-pretreated neonatal rats.  Conclusion  Dexmedetomidine targets microglial NOX2 to reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and subsequently protects against hippocampal synaptic loss following neonatal hypoxia.
33612106/The effect of the mGlu8 receptor agonist, (S)-3,4-DCPG on acquisition and expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference in male rats Background The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a principal role in drug reward. It has been reported that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) play a key role in the rewarding pathway(s). Previous studies have shown the vast allocation of the different types of mGlu receptors, including mGlu8 receptors, in regions that are associated with opioid rewards, such as the NAc. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of mGlu8 receptors within the NAc in the acquisition and expression phases of morphine induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male Wistar rats were bilaterally implanted by two cannulas' in the NAc and were evaluated in a CPP paradigm. Selective mGlu8 receptor allosteric agonist (S-3,4-DCPG) was administered at doses of 0.03, 0.3, and 3 mug/0.5 muL saline per side into the NAc on both sides during the 3 days of morphine (5 mg/kg) conditioning (acquisition) phase, or before place preference test, or post-conditioning (expression) phase of morphine-induced CPP. Results The results revealed that intra-accumbal administration of S-3,4-DCPG (0.3 and 3 mug) markedly decreased the acquisition in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on expression of morphine-induced CPP. Conclusions The findings suggest that activation of mGlu8 receptors in the NAc dose-dependently blocks the establishment of morphine-induced CPP and reduces the rewarding properties of morphine which may be related to the glutamate activity into the NAc and in reward pathway(s). These data suggest that mGlu8 receptor may be involved in conditioned morphine reward.
33618706/Production of bio-xylitol from d-xylose by an engineered Pichia pastoris expressing a recombinant xylose reductase did not require any auxiliary substrate as electron donor Background Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol that has numerous beneficial health properties. It has almost the same sweetness as sucrose but has lower energy value compared to the sucrose. Metabolism of xylitol is insulin independent and thus it is an ideal sweetener for diabetics. It is widely used in food products, oral and personal care, and animal nutrition as well. Here we present a two-stage strategy to produce bio-xylitol from d-xylose using a recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing a heterologous xylose reductase gene. The recombinant P. pastoris cells were first generated by a low-cost, standard procedure. The cells were then used as a catalyst to make the bio-xylitol from d-xylose. Results Pichia pastoris expressing XYL1 from P. stipitis and gdh from B. subtilis demonstrated that the biotransformation was very efficient with as high as 80% (w/w) conversion within two hours. The whole cells could be re-used for multiple rounds of catalysis without loss of activity. Also, the cells could directly transform d-xylose in a non-detoxified hemicelluloses hydrolysate to xylitol at 70% (w/w) yield. Conclusions We demonstrated here that the recombinant P. pastoris expressing xylose reductase could transform d-xylose, either in pure form or in crude hemicelluloses hydrolysate, to bio-xylitol very efficiently. This biocatalytic reaction happened without the external addition of any NAD(P)H, NAD(P)+, and auxiliary substrate as an electron donor. Our experimental design & findings reported here are not limited to the conversion of d-xylose to xylitol only but can be used with other many oxidoreductase reactions also, such as ketone reductases/alcohol dehydrogenases and amino acid dehydrogenases, which are widely used for the synthesis of high-value chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates.
33618704/Effect of Guanxin V in animal model of acute myocardial infarction Background Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most serious and lethal manifestation of coronary heart disease worldwide, presenting extremely high disability and mortality. Our previous studies have shown that Guanxin V (GXV) could significantly improve the cardiac function and the blood flow dynamics, and reduce serum levels of inflammatory factors in AMI rats, thus triggering ventricular remodeling (VR) at post-AMI. Methods An in vivo AMI model was established in Syrian hamsters by performing the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Syrian hamsters were randomly divided into four groups, namely Sham operation group (n = 12), AMI group (n = 12), GXV group (GXV 6 g/Kg/d, n = 12), and Tranilast group (Tra 105 mg/Kg/d, n = 12). Drug intervention was conducted for consecutive 8 weeks. Relative biological indicators were measured in the 4th and 8th week, respectively. Results Cardiac functions were improved, and the infarcted size and heart weight index were limited in Syrian hamsters of GXV and Tra groups compared with those in AMI group. Furthermore, GXV was able to decrease the number of mast cells and chymase level in Syrian hamsters with AMI. Administration of GXV remarkably inactivated the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system, and alleviated myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, thus slowing down VR at post-AMI. Conclusion GXV slows down the process of VR at post-AMI by reducing chymase level and mast cells number, as well as inactivating the reninangiotension-aldosterone system..

33617569/Genetic variation in surfactant protein-A2 alters responses to ozone Background Increased exposure to Ozone (O3) is associated with adverse health effects in individuals afflicted with respiratory diseases. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A), encoded by SP-A1 and SP-A2, is the largest protein component in pulmonary surfactant and is functionally impaired by O3-oxidation. Objective We used humanized SP-A2 transgenic mice with allelic variation corresponding to a glutamine (Q) to lysine (K) amino acid substitution at position 223 in the lectin domain to determine the impact of this genetic variation in regards to O3 exposure. Methods Mice were exposed to 2ppm O3 or Filtered Air (FA) for 3 hours and 24 hrs post-challenge pulmonary function tests and other parameters associated with inflammation were assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue. Additionally, mouse tracheal epithelial cells were cultured and TEER measurements recorded for each genotype to determine baseline epithelial integrity. Results Compared to FA, O3 exposure led to significantly increased sensitivity to methacholine challenge in all groups of mice. SP-A2 223Q variant mice were significantly protected from O3-induced AHR compared to SP-A-/- and SP-A2 223K mice. Neutrophilia was observed in all genotypes of mice post O3-exposure, however, SP-A2 223Q mice had a significantly lower percentage of neutrophils compared to SP-A-/- mice. Albumin levels in BAL were unchanged in O3-exposed SP-A2 223Q mice compared to their FA controls, while levels were significantly increased in all other genotypes of O3-exposed mice. SP-A 223Q MTECS has significant higher TEER values than all other genotypes, and WT MTECS has significantly higher TEER than the SP-A KO and SP-A 223K MTECS. Significance Taken together, our study suggests that expression of a glutamine (Q) as position 223 in SP-A2, as opposed to expression of lysine (K), is more protective in acute exposures to ozone and results in attenuated O3-induced AHR, neutrophilia, and vascular permeability.
33628387/Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Crocin Ameliorate Doxorubicin-Induced Nephrotoxicity in Rats Doxorubicin is a drug that belongs to the anthracycline antibiotics. Nephrotoxicity is one of the serious side effects of doxorubicin treatment. Crocin, which is one of the most bioactive components of saffron, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects. The current study was aimed at investigating the possible protective effects of crocin against doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this effect. The study included four groups, six rats in each group: normal control, crocin control, doxorubicin, and crocin/doxorubicin. Doxorubicin and crocin/doxorubicin groups received intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin (3.5 mg/kg twice weekly for 3 weeks). Rats in the crocin control group and the crocin/doxorubicin group were treated with intraperitoneal injections of crocin (100 mg/kg body weight per day) for 3 weeks. Biomarkers of kidney function and oxidative stress as well as the abundance of mRNA for nuclear factor-kappabeta and inducible nitric oxide synthase were evaluated. In addition, the abundance of cyclooxygenase 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha immunoreactivity was evaluated. Crocin treatment had renoprotective effects manifested by significant improvement in kidney function as well as a reduction in the abundance of biomarkers of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, crocin has a protective effect against doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats by serving as an antioxidant and attenuating the expression of NF-kappaB, iNOS, COX2, and TNFalpha.
33628372/Senkyunolide I Protects against Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy by Attenuating Sleep Deprivation in a Murine Model of Cecal Ligation and Puncture Sepsis may lead to sleep deprivation, which will promote the development of neuroinflammation and mediate the progression of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Senkyunolide I, an active component derived from an herb medicine, has been shown to provide a sedative effect to improve sleep. However, its role in sepsis is unclear. The present study was performed to investigate whether Senkyunolide I protected against SAE in a murine model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Here, we showed that Senkyunolide I treatment improved the 7-day survival rate and reduced the excessive release of cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta. A fear conditioning test was performed, and the results showed that Senkyunolide I attenuated CLP-induced cognitive dysfunction. Senkyunolide I treatment also decreased the phosphorylation levels of inflammatory signaling proteins, including p-ERK, p-JNK, p-P38, and p-P65, and the level of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, in the hippocampus homogenate. Sleep deprivation was attenuated by Senkyunolide I administration, as demonstrated by the modification of the BDNF and c-FOS expression. When sleep deprivation was induced manually, the protective effect of Senkyunolide I against inflammatory responses and cognitive dysfunction was reversed. Our data demonstrated that Senkyunolide I could protect against sepsis-associated encephalopathy in a murine model of sepsis via relieving sleep deprivation.
33622330/Screening for optimal protease producing Bacillus licheniformis strains with polymer-based controlled-release fed-batch microtiter plates Background Substrate-limited fed-batch conditions have the favorable effect of preventing overflow metabolism, catabolite repression, oxygen limitation or inhibition caused by elevated substrate or osmotic concentrations. Due to these favorable effects, fed-batch mode is predominantly used in industrial production processes. In contrast, screening processes are usually performed in microtiter plates operated in batch mode. This leads to a different physiological state of the production organism in early screening and can misguide the selection of potential production strains. To close the gap between screening and production conditions, new techniques to enable fed-batch mode in microtiter plates have been described. One of these systems is the ready-to-use and disposable polymer-based controlled-release fed-batch microtiter plate (fed-batch MTP). In this work, the fed-batch MTP was applied to establish a glucose-limited fed-batch screening procedure for industrially relevant protease producing Bacillus licheniformis strains. Results To achieve equal initial growth conditions for different clones with the fed-batch MTP, a two-step batch preculture procedure was developed. Based on this preculture procedure, the standard deviation of the protease activity of glucose-limited fed-batch main culture cultivations in the fed-batch MTP was +- 10%. The determination of the number of replicates revealed that a minimum of 6 parallel cultivations were necessary to identify clones with a statistically significant increased or decreased protease activity. The developed glucose-limited fed-batch screening procedure was applied to 13 industrially-relevant clones from two B. licheniformis strain lineages. It was found that 12 out of 13 clones (92%) were classified similarly as in a lab-scale fed-batch fermenter process operated under glucose-limited conditions. When the microtiter plate screening process was performed in batch mode, only 5 out of 13 clones (38%) were classified similarly as in the lab-scale fed-batch fermenter process. Conclusion The glucose-limited fed-batch screening process outperformed the usual batch screening process in terms of the predictability of the clone performance under glucose-limited fed-batch fermenter conditions. These results highlight that the implementation of glucose-limited fed-batch conditions already in microtiter plate scale is crucial to increase the precision of identifying improved protease producing B. licheniformis strains. Hence, the fed-batch MTP represents an efficient high-throughput screening tool that aims at closing the gap between screening and production conditions.
33626072/Characteristics of bile acid composition in high fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese diabetic rats Bile acid has attracted attention as a signal transmission molecule in energy metabolism. Although a high-fat diet (HFD) or obesity is known to increase hepatic fat content and alter bile acid composition, the changes in bile acid composition due to HFD or obesity remain to be elucidated. We sought to examine the bile acid composition in high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obese diabetic rats. Eight-week-old male spontaneously diabetic Torii fatty (SDTF) rats or control rats were fed an HFD. Twelve weeks post the commencement of HFD, serum and hepatic bile acid compositions and serum GLP-1 levels, which is stimulated by the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), were measured. The correlation between the bile acid composition and serum GLP-1 levels was also examined. While serum and hepatic levels of cholic acid (CA), a primary bile acid, tended to decrease in HFD-fed control rats, they were significantly decreased in HFD-fed SDTF rats. Hepatic CYP8B1, which plays a role in CA synthesis, the mRNA levels were significantly decreased in HFD-fed control and SDTF rats. In contrast, while serum and hepatic DCA levels were not changed in HFD-fed control rats, they were decreased in HFD-fed SDTF rats. Hepatic DCA/CA did not change in HFD-fed SDTF rats, but significantly increased in HFD-fed control rats. While serum GLP-1 levels were not changed in SDTF rats, they were significantly increased in HFD-fed control rats. Hepatic DCA/CA tended to correlate with serum GLP-1 levels, which tended to negatively correlate with the hepatic triglyceride content in SDTF rats. These results indicate that relatively increased DCA might contribute to an increase in serum GLP-1 levels, which inhibits hepatic steatosis in NAFLD.
33626069/Cardiometabolic risks and atherosclerotic disease in ApoE knockout mice: Effect of spinal cord injury and Salsalate anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy Objective To test in mice with a double mutation of the ApoE gene (ApoE-/-) whether spinal cord injury (SCI) hastens the native trajectory of, and established component risks for, atherosclerotic disease (AD), and whether Salsalate anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy attenuates the impact of SCI. Methods ApoE-/- mice were anesthetized and underwent a T9 laminectomy. Exposed spinal cords were given a contusion injury (70 k-dynes). Sham animals underwent all surgical procedures, excluding injury. Injured animals were randomized to 2 groups: SCI or SCI+Salsalate [120 mg/Kg/day i.p.]. Mice were serially sacrificed at 20-, 24-, and 28-weeks post-SCI, and body mass was recorded. At sacrifice, heart and aorta were harvested intact, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, cleaned and cut longitudinally for en face preparation. The aortic tree was stained with oil-red-O (ORO). AD lesion histomorphometry was calculated from the proportional area of ORO. Plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and proatherogenic inflammatory cytokines (PAIC's) were analyzed. Results AD lesion in the aortic arch progressively increased in ApoE-/-, significant at 24- and 28-weeks. AD in SCI is significantly greater at 24- and 28-weeks compared to time-controlled ApoE-/-. Salsalate treatment attenuates the SCI-induced increase at these time points. Body mass in all SCI groups are significantly reduced compared to time-controlled ApoE-/-. Cholesterol and triglycerides are significantly higher with SCI by 24- and 28-weeks, compared to ApoE-/-, and Salsalate reduces the SCI-induced effect on cholesterol. PAIC's interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL-5) are significantly greater with SCI compared to ApoE-/- at varying timepoints. Salsalate confers a marginal reducing effect on PAIC's by 28-weeks compared to SCI. Regression models determine that each PAIC is a significant and positive predictor of lesion. (p's <0.05). Conclusions SCI accelerates aortic AD and associated risk factors, and anti-inflammatory treatment may attenuate the impact of SCI on AD outcomes. PAIC's IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, MCP-1, and CCL-5 may be effective predictors of AD.
33627166/Seasonal patterns and spatial variation of Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) infections in Ixodes ricinus in the Netherlands Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis varies over time and space through as yet incompletely understood mechanisms. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with a Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) genospecies, which is primarily transmitted by a bite of Ixodes ricinus nymphs. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in nymphal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) (NIP), density of questing nymphs (DON) and the resulting density of infected nymphs (DIN). Methods We investigated the infection rates in I. ricinus nymphs that were collected monthly between 2009 and 2016 in 12 locations in the Netherlands. Using generalized linear mixed models, we explored how the NIP, DON and DIN varied during the seasons, between years and between locations. We also determined the genospecies of the Borrelia infections and investigated whether the genospecies composition differed between locations. Results The overall NIP was 14.7%. A seasonal pattern in infection prevalence was observed, with higher estimated prevalences in the summer than in the spring and autumn. This, combined with higher nymphal densities in summer, resulted in a pronounced summer peak in the estimated DIN. Over the 7.5-year study period, a significant decrease in infection prevalence was found, as well as a significant increase in nymphal density. These two effects appear to cancel each other out; the density of infected nymphs, which is the product of NIP x DON, showed no significant trend over years. Mean infection prevalence (NIP, averaged over all years and all months) varied considerably between locations, ranging from 5 to 26%. Borrelia genospecies composition differed between locations: in some locations almost all infections consisted of B. afzelii, whereas other locations had more diverse genospecies compositions. Conclusion In the Netherlands, the summer peak in DIN is a result of peaks in both NIP and DON. No significant trend in DIN was observed over the years of the study, and variations in DIN between locations were mostly a result of the variation in DON. There were considerable differences in acarological risk between areas in terms of infection prevalence and densities of ticks as well as in Borrelia genospecies composition.
33630922/Deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer improves yield, nitrogen use efficiency and economic returns of transplanted fine rice Rice (Oryza sativa L.) feeds to two-third of the global population by serving as staple food. It is the main export commodity of several countries; thus, contributes towards foreign exchange earnings. Unfortunately, average global rice yield is far below than its genetic potential. Low nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) is among the major reasons for low average yield. Current study evaluated the impact of nitrogen fertilizer application methods (conventional and deep placement) on growth, yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, agronomic N-use efficiency (ANUE), partial factors productivity of applied N (PFP) and economic returns of two different transplanted rice varieties (Basmati-515 and Super-Basmati). Fertilizer application methods significantly affected allometry, yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP and economic returns. Deep placement of N-fertilizer (DPNF) observed better allometric traits, high chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP, yield attributes and economic returns compared to conventional application of N-fertilizer (CANF). Similarly, Basmati-515 had better allometric and yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP and economic returns than Super-Basmati. Regarding interactions among N-fertilizer application methods and rice varieties, Basmati-515 with DPNF resulted in higher chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP, allometric and yield related traits and economic returns than CANF. The lowest values of these traits were observed for Super-Basmati with no application of N-fertilizer. Both varieties had better yield and economic returns with DPNF compared to CANF. It is concluded that DPNF improved yield, ANUE and economic returns; therefore, should be opted to improve productivity of transplanted fine rice. Nonetheless, lower nitrogen doses need to be tested for DPNF to infer whether it could lower N use in rice crop.
33632196/Essential oils from Syzygium aromaticum and Zingiber officinale, administered alone or in combination with benznidazole, reduce the parasite load in mice orally inoculated with Trypanosoma cruzi II Background Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD) or American trypanosomiasis, an important public health problem in Latin America. Benznidazole (BZ), a drug available for its treatment, has limited efficacy and significant side effects. Essential oils (EOs) have demonstrated trypanocidal activity and may constitute a therapeutic alternative. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the EOs of clove (CEO - Syzygium aromaticum) and ginger (GEO - Zingiber officinale), administered alone and in combination with BZ, in Swiss mice infected with T. cruzi. Methods The animals were inoculated with 10,000 blood trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi II by gavage and divided into four groups (n = 12 to 15): 1) untreated control (NT); 2) treated with BZ; 3) treated with CEO or GEO; and 4) treated with BZ + CEO or GEO. The treatments consisted of oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day, from the 5th day after parasite inoculation, for 20 consecutive days. All groups were submitted to fresh blood examination (FBE), blood culture (BC), conventional PCR (cPCR) and real-time PCR (qPCR), before and after immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. Results Clove and ginger EOs, administered alone and in combination with BZ, promoted suppression of parasitemia (p < 0.0001), except for the animals treated with CEO alone, which presented a parasitemia curve similar to NT animals. However, there was a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (< 0.0001) in this group. Treatment with GEO alone, on the other hand, besides promoting a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (p < 0.01), this EO also resulted in a decrease in mortality rate (p < 0.05) of treated mice. Conclusions Decreased parasite load, as detected by qPCR, was observed in all treatment groups (BZ, CEO, GEO and BZ + EOs), demonstrating benefits even in the absence of parasitological cure, thus opening perspectives for further studies.

33637095/The value of the hedgehog signal in osteoblasts in fluoride-induced bone-tissue injury Objective This study was designed to observe the expression of important hedgehog (Hh) signal factors in the bone tissue of rats with chronic fluorosis and cultured osteoblasts in order to investigate the role and significance of the Hh signal in fluoride-induced bone injury. Methods Healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: the control group, the fluorosis group (F Group), the fluoride + blocker group (F + Cycl group: rats were treated with fluoride + cyclopamine), and the fluoride + blocker control group (F + DMSO group). After 6 months of intervention, the urinary fluoride content of rats in each group was detected. The primary osteoblasts of rats were selected for cell experiment, and the experiment was carried out after the cells were passaged from the second to the fourth generation. Results The proliferation rate of primary rat osteoblasts presented time-affected and dose-affected relationships in a short time under treatment with a low dose of sodium fluoride (NaF), but the proliferation of osteoblasts was inhibited by long-term and high-dose NaF exposure. In the F group, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of osteoblasts increased gradually. The ALP activity was lower in the F + Cycl group than in the F group, and there was no significant difference between the F + DMSO group and F group. With the increase in fluoride exposure, the expression of Hh signal factors and osteogenic-related factor proteins increased gradually. The expressions of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), smoothened (Smo), Glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli) 2, and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2)in the F + Cycl group increased with the dose of fluoride but they were significantly inhibited compared with the F group. Compared with the control group, the content of urinary fluoride in the F group was significantly higher (P < 0.05), but there was no significant change in urinary fluoride content in the F + Cycl group and the F + DMSO group. Compared with the control group, the serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) contents of rats in the other groups increased after 6 months' intake of fluoride water (P < 0.05). After drug blocking, the serum BALP content in the F + Cycl group was lower than that in the F + DMSO group (P < 0.05). The BALP content in the F + DMSO group was similar to that in the F group: it did not decrease. The mRNA expressions of Ihh, Smo, Gli2, and Runx2 in bone tissue of the F group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). After cyclopamine blocking, the expressions decreased (P < 0.05), but the differences between the F + DMSO group and F group were not statistically significant. Conclusion Hh signal plays an important role in fluoride-induced bone injury. The effective inhibition of cyclopamine is expected to be a new target for the treatment of skeletal damage caused by fluorosis.
33573276/Stratification of Volunteers According to Flavanone Metabolite Excretion and Phase II Metabolism Profile after Single Doses of 'Pera' Orange and 'Moro' Blood Orange Juices Large interindividual variations in the biological response to citrus flavanones have been observed, and this could be associated with high variations in their bioavailability. The aim of this study was to identify the main determinants underlying interindividual differences in citrus flavanone metabolism and excretion. In a randomized cross-over study, non-obese and obese volunteers, aged 19-40 years, ingested single doses of Pera and Moro orange juices, and urine was collected for 24 h. A large difference in the recovery of the urinary flavanone phase II metabolites was observed, with hesperetin-sulfate and hesperetin-sulfo-O-glucuronide being the major metabolites. Subjects were stratified according to their total excretion of flavanone metabolites as high, medium, and low excretors, but the expected correlation with the microbiome was not observed at the genus level. A second stratification was proposed according to phase II flavanone metabolism, whereby participants were divided into two excretion groups: Profiles A and B. Profile B individuals showed greater biotransformation of hesperetin-sulfate to hesperetin-sulfo-O-glucuronide, as well as transformation of flavanone-monoglucuronide to the respective diglucuronides, suggestive of an influence of polymorphisms on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. In conclusion, this study proposes a new stratification of volunteers based on their metabolic profiles. Gut microbiota composition and polymorphisms of phase II enzymes may be related to the interindividual variability of metabolism.
33499139/Beverages Based on Second Quality Citrus Fruits and Maqui Berry, a Source of Bioactive (Poly)phenols: Sorting Out Urine Metabolites upon a Longitudinal Study The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages has been associated with an augmented prevalence of metabolic diseases, namely, obesity, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. On the other hand, nowadays, it is broadly accepted that foods and beverages rich in (poly)phenols could contribute to reducing the incidence of these pathologies. In this sense, the objective of the work was to revalue second quality citrus fruits for the development of new beverages, rich in anthocyanins and flavanones (maqui berry and second qualities citrus-based), and evaluate the influence of alternative sweeteners (sucralose, sucrose, or stevia), regarding the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of these bioactive compounds in the frame of a chronic (longitudinal) intervention. To fulfill this objective, a longitudinal study of the urinary excretion of anthocyanins and flavanones, after 2-months of ingestion of the developed maqui-citrus beverage, by 138 volunteers (n = 46 per beverage) and the analysis of the resulting phenolic metabolites by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS) was carried out. As major results, the bioavailable metabolites of caffeic acid (CA), catechol (CAT), 3,4-di-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPAA), eriodictyol (E), homoeriodictyol (HE), hippuric acid (HA), naringenin (N), trans-ferulic acid (TFA), 2,4,6-tri-hydroxybenzaldehyde (THBA), trans-isoferulic acid (TIFA), and vanillic acid (VA) were detected. Accordingly, significantly different bioavailability was dependent on the sweetener used, allowing proposing stevia and, to a lower extent, sucralose, as valuable alternatives to sucrose.
33499406/The Usefulness of Serum Vitamin D Levels in the Assessment of IBD Activity and Response to Biologics The main role of vitamin D is calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, although its activity as an immuno-modulator and its anti-inflammatory effect is well-known. Low blood vitamin D levels are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whether low vitamin D levels could affect the disease activity or it is an effect of a worse condition of the disease is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of blood vitamin D levels to identify the clinical, endoscopic, and histological activity in a cohort of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) on therapy with biological drugs. In this retrospective cohort study, 50 IBD patients (24 UC and 26 CD) that underwent colonoscopy from January 2017 to January 2020 with a concomitant serological evaluation of vitamin D were included. Patients with clinical, endoscopic, and histological activity and those who lost their clinical response to the biological drug had lower vitamin D levels compared to patients in remission or patients that did not change therapeutic regimens. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Youden's Index were performed to assess the optimal vitamin D levels to identify patients with the active disease. The ROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.709 (p = 0.005; confidence interval (CI): 0.564-0.829), 0.769 (p < 0.001; CI: 0.628-0.876), and 0.810 (p < 0.001; CI: 0.670-0.910) for the clinical, endoscopic, and histological outcomes, respectively. The optimal vitamin D cut-off was <=25 ng/mL. The vitamin D level is an additional useful tool in the evaluation of IBD patients with good accuracy to predict their endoscopic and histological activity and clinical response to biologics.
33498837/Fractalkine, sICAM-1 and Kynurenine Pathway in Restrictive Anorexia Nervosa-Exploratory Study The link between the kynurenine pathway and immunomodulatory molecules:fractalkine and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1):in anorexia nervosa (AN) remains unknown. Fractalkine, sICAM-1, tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), neuroprotective kynurenic acid (KYNA), neurotoxic 3-OH-kynurenine (3-OH-KYN), and the expression of mRNA for kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT1-3) were studied in 20 female patients with restrictive AN (mostly drug-free, all during first episode of the disease) and in 24 controls. In AN, serum fractalkine, but not sICAM-1, KYNA, KYN, TRP or 3-OH-KYN, was higher; ratios TRP/KYN, KYN/KYNA, KYN/3-OH-KYN and KYNA/3-OH-KYN were unaltered. The expression of the gene encoding KAT3, but not of genes encoding KAT1 and KAT2 (measured in blood mononuclear cells), was higher in patients with AN. In AN, fractalkine positively correlated with TRP, while sICAM-1 was negatively associated with 3-OH-KYN and positively linked with the ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN. Furthermore, TRP and fractalkine were negatively associated with the body mass index (BMI) in AN. Expression of KAT1, KAT2 and KAT3 did not correlate with fractalkine, sICAM-1 or BMI, either in AN or control. Increased fractalkine may be an independent factor associated with the restrictive type of AN. Excessive physical activity probably underlies increased expression of KAT3 observed among enrolled patients. Further, longitudinal studies on a larger cohort of patients should be aimed to clarify the contribution of fractalkine and KAT3 to the pathogenesis of AN.
33525526/The Influence of Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid, Docosahexaenoic Acid, on Child Behavioral Functioning: A Review of Randomized Controlled Trials of DHA Supplementation in Pregnancy, the Neonatal Period and Infancy This is a review of randomized controlled trials using docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) interventions in the first 1000 days of life with assessments of behavioral functioning in childhood. Electronic databases were searched for trials with a DHA intervention (compared with a placebo group that received no or less DHA) at any time to either women or infants during the first 1000 days, with a subsequent assessment of child behavior. There were 25 trials involving 10,320 mother-child pairs, and 71 assessments of behavior in 6867 of the children (66.5% of those originally enrolled). From the 71 assessments administered, there were 401 comparisons between a DHA group and a control group, with most reporting a null effect. There were no findings of a positive effect of DHA, and 23 instances where the DHA group had worse scores compared with the control group. There was limited evidence that DHA supplementation had any effect on behavioral development, although two of the largest trials with behavioral measures detected adverse effects. Future trials, and future follow-ups of existing trials, should make an effort to evaluate the effect of DHA intervention on behavioral functioning.
33525622/Composition of Dietary Fatty Acids and Health Risks in Japanese Youths In the overall composition of dietary fatty acids (FAs), the quantity of each FA is interrelated with that of others. We examined the associations between dietary FA composition and cardiometabolic risk in Japanese youths. Risk factors (anthropometric characteristics, serum lipid and liver enzyme levels, and blood pressure) were measured in 5485 junior-high-school students. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. The mean saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and omega-3 PUFAs intake were 9.6%E, 10.3%E, 6.3%E, and 1.1%E, respectively. In compositional regression analysis controlled for confounders, a high intake of omega-6 PUFAs relative to others was associated with low low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C; p = 0.003), and relative SFA intake was associated with high levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (p = 0.019). Relative omega-3 PUFAs intake was associated with low blood pressure (p = 0.005-0.034) but had unfavorable effects on adiposity and alanine transaminase. Substitutional models showed similar results for omega-6 PUFAs on LDL-C, but MUFA had inconsistent effects on risk factors. The results from the compositional data analysis were consistent with previous studies and clinical practice/knowledge. Focusing on increasing omega-6 PUFAs in Japanese youths could have favorable consequences in the long term.
33499025/beta-Lactoglobulin Elevates Insulin and Glucagon Concentrations Compared with Whey Protein:A Randomized Double-Blinded Crossover Trial in Patients with Type Two Diabetes Mellitus Whey protein is an insulinotropic fraction of dairy that reduces postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We have recently shown that beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), the largest protein fraction of whey, elevates insulin concentrations compared with iso-nitrogenous whey protein isolate (WPI) in healthy individuals. We therefore hypothesized that BLG pre-meals would lower glucose levels compared with WPI in patients with T2DM. We investigated 16 participants with T2DM using a randomized double-blinded cross-over design with two pre-meal interventions, (i) 25 g BLG and (ii) 25 g WPI prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), followed by four days of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at home. BLG increased concentrations of insulin with 10%, glucagon with 20%, and glucose with 10% compared with WPI after the OGTT (all p < 0.05). Both BLG and WPI reduced the interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose concentrations (using CGM) with 2 mM and lowered glycemic variability with 10-15%, compared with tap-water (p < 0.05), and WPI lowered the ISF glucose with 0.5 mM compared with BLG from 120 min and onwards (p < 0.05). In conclusion, BLG pre-meals resulted in higher insulin, glucagon, and glucose concentrations compared with WPI in participants with T2DM. Pre-meal servings of WPI remains the most potent protein in terms of lowering postprandial glucose excursions.
33525653/Analytical Performance Specifications for 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Examinations Currently the 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration is thought to be the best estimate of the vitamin D status of an individual. Unfortunately, its measurement remains complex, despite recent technological advances. We evaluated the biological variation (BV) of 25(OH)D in order to set analytical performance specifications (APS) for measurement uncertainty (MU). Six European laboratories recruited 91 healthy participants. The 25(OH)D concentrations in K3-EDTA plasma were examined weekly for up to 10 weeks in duplicate on a Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). The linear regression of the mean 25(OH)D concentrations at each blood collection showed that participants were not in a steady state. The dissection of the 10-sample collection into two subsets, namely collections 1-5 and 6-10, did not allow for correction of the lack of homogeneity: estimates of the within-subject BV ranged from 5.8% to 7.1% and the between-subject BV ranged from 25.0% to 39.2%. Methods that would differentiate a difference induced by 25(OH)D supplementation at p < 0.05 should have MU < 13.6%, while at p < 0.01, the MU should be <9.6%. The development of APS using BV assumes a steady state of patients. The findings in this study suggest that patients are not in steady state. Therefore, APS that are based on MU appear to be more appropriate.
33498641/Effects of Three-Month Feeding High Fat Diets with Different Fatty Acid Composition on Myocardial Proteome in Mice Westernized diet is characterized by a high content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and a low level of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), often accompanied by an imbalance in the omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio. Since increased intake of SFA and n-6 PUFA is considered as a cardiovascular disease risk factor, this study was conducted to determine whether a three-month dietary supplementation of high-fat diets (HFDs) with saturated fatty acids and a significant proportion of various n-6 and n-3 PUFA ratios would affect the architecture and protein expression patterns of the murine heart. Therefore, three HFD (n = 6) feeding groups: rich in SFA, dominated by PUFA with the n-6/n-3-14:1, and n-6/n-3-5:1, ratios were compared to animals fed standard mouse chow. For this purpose, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis with MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry-based identification of differentially expressed cardiac proteins, and a histological examination of cardiac morphology. The results indicated that mice fed with all HFDs developed signs of hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. Animals fed SFA-rich HFD manifested the most severe cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis lesions, whereas less pronounced changes were observed in the group of animals that ingested the highest amount of omega-3 FA. In general, all HFDs, regardless of FA composition, evoked a comparable pattern of cardiac protein changes and affected the following biological processes: lipid metabolism and FA beta-oxidation, glycolysis, TCA cycle, respiratory chain, myocardium contractility, oxidative stress and PUFA eicosanoid metabolism. However, it should be noted that three proteins, namely IDH3A, LDHB, and AK1, were affected differently by various FA contents. High expression of these myocardial proteins found in the group of animals fed a HFD with the highest n-3 PUFA content could be closely related to the observed development of hypertrophy.
33499250/Effect of Calcium Fortified Foods on Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Calcium supplementation and fortification are strategies widely used to prevent adverse outcome in population with low-calcium intake which is highly frequent in low-income settings. We aimed to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of calcium fortified foods on calcium intake and related health, or economic outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis involving participants of any age or gender, drawn from the general population. We searched PubMed, Agricola, EMBASE, CINAHL, Global Health, EconLit, the FAO website and Google until June 2019, without language restrictions. Pair of reviewers independently selected, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies using Covidence software. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We performed meta-analyses using RevMan 5.4 and subgroup analyses by study design, age group, and fortification levels. We included 20 studies of which 15 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three were non-randomised studies and two were economic evaluations. Most RCTs had high risk of bias on randomization or blinding. Most represented groups were women and children from 1 to 72 months, most common intervention vehicles were milk and bakery products with a fortification levels between 96 and 1200 mg per 100 g of food. Calcium intake increased in the intervention groups between 460 mg (children) and 1200 mg (postmenopausal women). Most marked effects were seen in children. Compared to controls, height increased 0.83 cm (95% CI 0.00; 1.65), plasma parathyroid hormone decreased -1.51 pmol/L, (-2.37; -0.65), urine:calcium creatinine ratio decreased -0.05, (-0.07; -0.03), femoral neck and hip bone mineral density increased 0.02 g/cm2 (0.01; 0.04) and 0.03 g/cm2 (0.00; 0.06), respectively. The largest cost savings (43%) reported from calcium fortification programs came from prevented hip fractures in older women from Germany. Our study highlights that calcium fortification leads to a higher calcium intake, small benefits in children's height and bone health and also important evidence gaps for other outcomes and populations that could be solved with high quality experimental or quasi-experimental studies in relevant groups, especially as some evidence of calcium supplementation show controversial results on the bone health benefit on older adults.
33498618/Interaction between Vitamin D-Related Genetic Risk Score and Carbohydrate Intake on Body Fat Composition: A Study in Southeast Asian Minangkabau Women Metabolic diseases have been shown to be associated with low vitamin D status; however, the findings have been inconsistent. Hence, the objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between vitamin D status and metabolic disease-related traits in healthy Southeast Asian women and examine whether this relationship was modified by dietary factors using a nutrigenetic study. The study included 110 Minangkabau women (age: 25-60 years) from Padang, Indonesia. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were constructed based on five vitamin D-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (vitamin D-GRS) and ten metabolic disease-associated SNPs (metabolic-GRS). The metabolic-GRS was significantly associated with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations (p = 0.009) and higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.016). Even though the vitamin D-GRS had no effect on metabolic traits (p > 0.12), an interaction was observed between the vitamin D-GRS and carbohydrate intake (g) on body fat percentage (BFP) (pinteraction = 0.049), where those individuals who consumed a high carbohydrate diet (mean +- SD: 319 g/d +- 46) and carried >2 vitamin D-lowering risk alleles had significantly higher BFP (p = 0.016). In summary, we have replicated the association of metabolic-GRS with higher BMI and lower 25(OH)D concentrations and identified a novel interaction between vitamin D-GRS and carbohydrate intake on body fat composition.
33498897/Myricetin as a Promising Molecule for the Treatment of Post-Ischemic Brain Neurodegeneration The available drug therapy for post-ischemic neurodegeneration of the brain is symptomatic. This review provides an evaluation of possible dietary therapy for post-ischemic neurodegeneration with myricetin. The purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of what scientists have done regarding the benefits of myricetin in post-ischemic neurodegeneration. The data in this article contribute to a better understanding of the potential benefits of myricetin in the treatment of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration, and inform physicians, scientists and patients, as well as their caregivers, about treatment options. Due to the pleiotropic properties of myricetin, including anti-amyloid, anti-phosphorylation of tau protein, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and autophagous, as well as increasing acetylcholine, myricetin is a promising candidate for treatment after ischemia brain neurodegeneration with full-blown dementia. In this way, it may gain interest as a potential substance for the prophylaxis of the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration. It is a safe substance, commercially available, inexpensive and registered as a pro-health product in the US and Europe. Taken together, the evidence available in the review on the therapeutic potential of myricetin provides helpful insight into the potential clinical utility of myricetin in treating neurodegenerative disorders with full-blown dementia. Therefore, myricetin may be a promising complementary agent in the future against the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration. Indeed, there is a scientific rationale for the use of myricetin in the prevention and treatment of brain neurodegeneration caused by ischemia.
33498709/Association between Vitamin D and Heart Failure Mortality in 10,974 Hospitalized Individuals A broad range of chronic conditions, including heart failure (HF), have been associated with vitamin D deficiency. Existing clinical trials involving vitamin D supplementation in chronic HF patients have been inconclusive. We sought to evaluate the outcomes of patients with vitamin D supplementation, compared with a matched cohort using real-world big data of HF hospitalization. This study was based on the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Datasets (JROAD-DPC). After exclusion criteria, we identified 93,692 patients who were first hospitalized with HF between April 2012 and March 2017 (mean age was 79 +- 12 years, and 52.2% were male). Propensity score (PS) was estimated with logistic regression model, with vitamin D supplementation as the dependent variable and clinically relevant covariates. On PS-matched analysis with 10,974 patients, patients with vitamin D supplementation had lower total in-hospital mortality (6.5 vs. 9.4%, odds ratio: 0.67, p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality within 7 days and 30 days (0.9 vs. 2.5%, OR, 0.34, and 3.8 vs. 6.5%, OR: 0.56, both p < 0.001). In the sub-group analysis, mortalities in patients with age < 75, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial arrhythmia, cancer, renin-angiotensin system blocker, and beta-blocker were not affected by vitamin D supplementation. Patients with vitamin D supplementation had a lower in-hospital mortality for HF than patients without vitamin D supplementation in the propensity matched cohort. The identification of specific clinical characteristics in patients benefitting from vitamin D may be useful for determining targets of future randomized control trials.
33573299/Added Sugars in School Meals and the Diets of School-Age Children Research is limited on added sugars in school meals and children's dietary intakes after the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommended that added sugars be limited to less than 10% of total calories. This analysis uses data from the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS) to examine levels of added sugars in: (1) school meals and (2) children's dietary intakes at breakfast, lunch, and over 24 h on school days. SNMCS data were collected in the 2014-2015 school year after updated nutrition standards for school meals were implemented. Most schools exceeded the DGA limit for added sugars at breakfast (92%), while 69% exceeded the limit at lunch. The leading source of added sugars in school meals (both breakfasts and lunches) was flavored skim milk. More than 62% of children consumed breakfasts that exceeded the DGA limit, and almost half (47%) consumed lunches that exceeded the limit. Leading sources of added sugars in the breakfasts consumed by children were sweetened cold cereals and condiments and toppings; leading sources of added sugars in children's lunches were flavored skim milk and cake. Over 24 h, 63% of children exceeded the DGA limit. These findings show that school meals and children's dietary intakes are high in added sugars relative to the DGA limit and provide insights into the types of foods that should be targeted in order to decrease levels of added sugars.
33573133/Application of Molecular Hydrogen as an Antioxidant in Responses to Ventilatory and Ergogenic Adjustments during Incremental Exercise in Humans We investigated effects of molecular hydrogen (H2) supplementation on acid-base status, pulmonary gas exchange responses, and local muscle oxygenation during incremental exercise. Eighteen healthy, trained subjects in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design received H2-rich calcium powder (HCP) (1500 mg/day, containing 2.544 microg/day of H2) or H2-depleted placebo (1500 mg/day) for three consecutive days. They performed cycling incremental exercise starting at 20-watt work rate, increasing by 20 watts/2 min until exhaustion. Breath-by-breath pulmonary ventilation (E) and CO2 output (CO2) were measured and muscle deoxygenation (deoxy[Hb + Mb]) was determined via time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy in the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF). Blood gases' pH, lactate, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentrations were measured at rest and 120-, 200-, and 240-watt work rates. At rest, the HCP group had significantly lower E, CO2, and higher HCO3-, partial pressures of CO2 (PCO2) versus placebo. During exercise, a significant pH decrease and greater HCO3- continued until 240-watt workload in HCP. The E was significantly lower in HCP versus placebo, but HCP did not affect the gas exchange status of CO2 or oxygen uptake (O2). HCP increased absolute values of deoxy[Hb + Mb] at the RF but not VL. Thus, HCP-induced hypoventilation would lead to lower pH and secondarily impaired balance between O2 delivery and utilization in the local RF during exercise, suggesting that HCP supplementation, which increases the at-rest antioxidant potential, affects the lower ventilation and pH status during incremental exercise. HPC induced a significantly lower O2 delivery/utilization ratio in the RF but not the VL, which may be because these regions possess inherently different vascular/metabolic control properties, perhaps related to fiber-type composition.
33572579/Enhanced Zinc Intake Protects against Oxidative Stress and Its Consequences in the Brain: A Study in an In Vivo Rat Model of Cadmium Exposure We examined, in a rat model of moderate environmental human exposure to cadmium (Cd), whether the enhanced intake of zinc (Zn) may protect against Cd-caused destroying the oxidative/antioxidative balance and its consequences in the brain. The intoxication with Cd (5 mg/L, 6 months) weakened the enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase) and non-enzymatic (total thiol groups, reduced glutathione) antioxidative barrier decreasing the total antioxidative status and increased the concentrations of pro-oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, myeloperoxidase) in this organ and its total oxidative status. These resulted in the development of oxidative stress and oxidative modifications of lipids and proteins. The co-administration of Zn (30 and 60 mg/L enhancing this element intake by 79% and 151%, respectively) importantly protected against Cd accumulation in the brain tissue and this xenobiotic-induced development of oxidative stress and oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. Moreover, this bioelement also prevented Cd-mediated oxidative stress evaluated in the serum. The favorable effect of Zn was caused by its independent action and interaction with Cd. Concluding, the enhancement of Zn intake under oral exposure to Cd may prevent the oxidative/antioxidative imbalance and oxidative stress in the brain and thus protect against injury of cellular macromolecules in the nervous system.
33525516/Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999-2018 Low intakes of fruits and vegetables have resulted in suboptimal intakes of several micronutrients, including vitamin C. This cross-sectional study used data from 84,902 children/adults (>=1 y) who completed a 24-h dietary recall as part of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018). Mean vitamin C intakes from foods/beverages were calculated as were trends in major food/beverage sources of vitamin C. Percentages below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) were estimated. Overall, mean vitamin C consumption declined by 23% (97-75 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). 100% fruit juice was the leading source of vitamin C (25.6% of total or 21.7mg/d), but this declined by 48% (25-13 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). Whole fruit increased among children/adolescents (+75.8%;10-17 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001), but not adults, while the vegetable contribution was generally unchanged. The proportion of the population below the EAR increased by 23.8% on a relative scale or 9 percentage points on an absolute scale (38.3-47.4%). Declines in vitamin C intake is driven largely by decreases in fruit juice coupled with modest increases in whole fruit. Due to associations between vitamin C intake and numerous health outcomes these trends warrant careful monitoring moving forward.
33498991/Butyrate Protects Porcine Colon Epithelium from Hypoxia-Induced Damage on a Functional Level The large intestinal epithelium is confronted with the necessity to adapt quickly to varying levels of oxygenation. In contrast to other tissues, it meets this requirement successfully and remains unharmed during (limited) hypoxic periods. The large intestine is also the site of bacterial fermentation producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Amongst these SCFA, butyrate has been reported to ameliorate many pathological conditions. Thus, we hypothesized that butyrate protects the colonocytes from hypoxic damage. We used isolated porcine colon epithelium mounted in Ussing chambers, incubated it with or without butyrate and simulated hypoxia by changing the gassing regime to test this hypothesis. We found an increase in transepithelial conductance and a decrease in short-circuit current across the epithelia when simulating hypoxia for more than 30 min. Incubation with 50 mM butyrate significantly ameliorated these changes to the epithelial integrity. In order to characterize the protective mechanism, we compared the effects of butyrate to those of iso-butyrate and propionate. These two SCFAs exerted similar effects to butyrate. Therefore, we propose that the protective effect of butyrate on colon epithelium under hypoxia is not (only) based on its nutritive function, but rather on the intracellular signaling effects of SCFA.
33573205/Nutritional Importance of Selected Fresh Fishes, Shrimps and Mollusks to Meet Compliance with Nutritional Guidelines of n-3 LC-PUFA Intake in Spain Fishery products are the main source of dietary n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA). Following the European Commission's request to address the risks and benefits of seafood consumption, and taking into account the great variability of nutrient and contaminant levels in fishery products, the present work aims to estimate the n-3 LC-PUFA provided per serving of selected fishes, shrimps and mollusks that are commonly consumed in Spain. This would enable the establishment of a risk-benefit analysis of fish consumption and provide recommendations for fish intake to comply with nutritional guidelines of n-3 LC-PUFA intake. We confirmed high variation in the pattern and contents of fatty acids for different species. n-6 PUFA were minor fatty acids, whereas palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1 n-9), and mainly eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6 n-3) acids were the major fatty acids in the sample. Therefore, consumption of 2-3 servings per week of a variety of fishery products may contribute to compliance with the recommended daily n-3 LC-PUFA intake while maintaining an adequate balance to avoid contaminant-derived potential risks (metals and others). Taking the fatty acid content of fishery products described in this study into consideration, it is advisable to include one serving of fatty fish per week in order to meet recommended n-3 LC-PUFA levels.
33525601/Interactions of Oxysterols with Atherosclerosis Biomarkers in Subjects with Moderate Hypercholesterolemia and Effects of a Nutraceutical Combination (Bifidobacterium longum BB536, Red Yeast Rice Extract) (Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study) Background: Oxysterol relationship with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors is poorly explored, especially in moderately hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Moreover, the impact of nutraceuticals controlling hypercholesterolaemia on plasma levels of 24-, 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC, 25-OHC, 27-OHC) is unknown. Methods: Subjects (n = 33; 18-70 years) with moderate hypercholesterolaemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C:): 130-200 mg/dL), in primary CV prevention as well as low CV risk were studied cross-sectionally. Moreover, they were evaluated after treatment with a nutraceutical combination (Bifidobacterium longum BB536, red yeast rice extract (10 mg/dose monacolin K)), following a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. We evaluated 24-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC levels by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Results: 24-OHC and 25-OHC were significantly correlated, 24-OHC was correlated with apoB. 27-OHC and 27-OHC/total cholesterol (TC) were higher in men (median 209 ng/mL and 77 ng/mg, respectively) vs. women (median 168 ng/mL and 56 ng/mg, respectively); 27-OHC/TC was significantly correlated with abdominal circumference, visceral fat and, negatively, with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Triglycerides were significantly correlated with 24-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC and with 24-OHC/TC and 25-OHC/TC. After intervention, 27-OHC levels were significantly reduced by 10.4% in the nutraceutical group Levels of 24-OHC, 24-OHC/TC, 25-OHC, 25-OHC/TC and 27-OHC/TC were unchanged. Conclusions: In this study, conducted in moderate hypercholesterolemic subjects, we observed novel relationships between 24-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC and CV risk biomarkers. In addition, no adverse changes of OHC levels upon nutraceutical treatment were found.
33498674/Epidemiology and (Patho)Physiology of Folic Acid Supplement Use in Obese Women before and during Pregnancy Preconception folic acid supplement use is a well-known method of primary prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs). Obese women are at a higher risk for having a child with a NTD. As different international recommendations on folic acid supplement use for obese women before and during pregnancy exist, this narrative review provides an overview of epidemiology of folate deficiency in obese (pre)pregnant women, elaborates on potential mechanisms underlying folate deficiency, and discusses considerations for the usage of higher doses of folic acid supplements. Women with obesity more often suffer from an absolute folate deficiency, as they are less compliant to periconceptional folic acid supplement use recommendations. In addition, their dietary folate intake is limited due to an unbalanced diet (relative malnutrition). The association of obesity and NTDs also seems to be independent of folate intake, with studies suggesting an increased need of folate (relative deficiency) due to derangements involved in other pathways. The relative folate deficiency, as a result of an increased metabolic need for folate in obese women, can be due to: (1) low-grade chronic inflammation (2) insulin resistance, (3) inositol, and (4) dysbiotic gut microbiome, which plays a role in folate production and uptake. In all these pathways, the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is involved. In conclusion, scientific evidence of the involvement of several folate-related pathways implies to increase the recommended folic acid supplementation in obese women. However, the physiological uptake of synthetic folic acid is limited and side-effects of unmetabolized folic acid in mothers and offspring, in particular variations in epigenetic (re)programming with long-term health effects, cannot be excluded. Therefore, we emphasize on the urgent need for further research and preconception personalized counseling on folate status, lifestyle, and medical conditions.
33498924/The Consumption of Caffeine-Containing Products to Enhance Sports Performance: An Application of an Extended Model of the Theory of Planned Behavior Caffeine is the most-used psychoactive substance in the world. About 80% of the world's population consumes caffeine every day, including athletes and lifestyle users. Thus, it is important to understand the consumer drivers of caffeine-containing beverages and food. This research study aims to explore consumers' behaviors, perceptions, attitudes, and drivers towards caffeine-containing products to enhance sports performance. The research applies the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in order to understand consumers' behavior, extended with utilitarian aspects for a comprehensive understanding of consumers' behavior and attitudes. We interviewed consumers with the support of Qualtrics online software. The data were then processed with SPSS (statistical analysis software). The data elaboration includes a multivariate linear regression model to analyze the consumers' intention to consume caffeine to enhance the sports performance, and to explore consumers' preference of marketing leverages for this product category. The results contribute to an understanding of consumers' consumption and purchasing behavior towards caffeine, and support the validity of the extended TPB to develop a more comprehensive picture of consumer behavior. Consumers have a positive attitude towards caffeine-containing products to enhance sports performance. The main consumer behavior drivers are subjective norms and utilitarian aspects. The present research results may support companies in the development of caffeine-containing products to enhance sports performance.
33573164/Magnesium in Aging, Health and Diseases Several changes of magnesium (Mg) metabolism have been reported with aging, including diminished Mg intake, impaired intestinal Mg absorption and renal Mg wasting. Mild Mg deficits are generally asymptomatic and clinical signs are usually non-specific or absent. Asthenia, sleep disorders, hyperemotionality, and cognitive disorders are common in the elderly with mild Mg deficit, and may be often confused with age-related symptoms. Chronic Mg deficits increase the production of free radicals which have been implicated in the development of several chronic age-related disorders. Numerous human diseases have been associated with Mg deficits, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and stroke, cardio-metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, airways constrictive syndromes and asthma, depression, stress-related conditions and psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementia syndromes, muscular diseases (muscle pain, chronic fatigue, and fibromyalgia), bone fragility, and cancer. Dietary Mg and/or Mg consumed in drinking water (generally more bioavailable than Mg contained in food) or in alternative Mg supplements should be taken into consideration in the correction of Mg deficits. Maintaining an optimal Mg balance all through life may help in the prevention of oxidative stress and chronic conditions associated with aging. This needs to be demonstrated by future studies.
33499257/Maternal Factors Associated with Levels of Fatty Acids, Specifically n-3 PUFA during Pregnancy: ECLIPSES Study An optimal fatty acid (FA) profile during pregnancy, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is essential for the health of the mother and child. Our aim was to identify the socioeconomic and maternal lifestyle factors associated with serum FA concentration in pregnant women. A longitudinal study was conducted on 479 pregnant women, who were assessed during the first (T1) and third (T3) trimesters of pregnancy. Data on maternal characteristics, food consumption, and lifestyle were collected. Serum FA concentrations were analysed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combination. The multiple linear regression showed that high educational level and older age were significantly associated with higher EPA and DHA concentrations and lower values of n-6/n-3 and arachidonic acid (AA)/EPA in T1 and/or T3. Regarding diet:fish and seafood consumption increased EPA concentration and reduced n-6/n-3 and AA/EPA values in both trimesters, whereas its consumption increased DHA concentration only in T1. Smoking was associated with lower DHA concentration in T1 and higher values of n-6/n-3 ratio in both trimester. Overweight and obesity were associated with higher values of n-6/n-3 ratio and AA/EPA ratio in T1. A statistically non-significant association was observed with saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). In conclusion, high educational levels, older age, fish, seafood consumption, and/or non-smoking, are factors that influence better omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) profile in both trimesters of pregnancy. Further research is needed to go in-depth into these findings and their health consequences.
33573174/Eicosapentaenoic Acid Is Associated with Decreased Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia in the Oldest Old Background. Omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have different effects on cognitive health due to their anti- or pro-inflammatory properties. Methods. We aimed to prospectively examine the relationships between n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents in serum phospholipids with incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD). We included 1264 non-demented participants aged 84 +- 3 years from the German Study on Ageing, Cognition, and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe) multicenter-cohort study. We investigated whether fatty acid concentrations in serum phospholipids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), and arachidonic acid (AA), were associated with risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Results. During the follow-up window of seven years, 233 participants developed dementia. Higher concentrations of EPA were associated with a lower incidence of AD (hazard ratio (HR) 0.76 (95% CI 0.63; 0.93)). We also observed that higher concentrations of EPA were associated with a decreased risk for all-cause dementia (HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.61; 0.94)) and AD (HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51; 0.85)) among apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) non-carriers but not among APOE epsilon4 carriers. No other fatty acids were significantly associated with AD or dementia. Conclusions. Higher concentrations of EPA were associated with a lower risk of incident AD. This further supports a beneficial role of n-3 PUFAs for cognitive health in old age.
33572630/Hypothalamic Renin-Angiotensin System and Lipid Metabolism: Effects of Virgin Olive Oil versus Butter in the Diet The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been recently involved in the homeostatic regulation of energy. Our goal was to analyse the influence of a diet rich in saturated fatty acids (butter) against one enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (olive oil) on hypothalamic RAS, and their relationship with the metabolism of fatty acids. Increases in body weight and visceral fat, together with an increase in aminopeptidase A expression and reductions in AngII and AngIV were observed in the hypothalamus of animals fed with the butter diet. In this group, a marked reduction in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism (LPL, CD36, and CPT-1) was observed in liver and muscle. No changes were found in terms of body weight, total visceral fat and the expression of hepatic genes related to fatty acid metabolism in the olive oil diet. The expressions of LPL and CD36 were reduced in the muscles, although the decrease was lower than in the butter diet. At the same time, the fasting levels of leptin were reduced, no changes were observed in the hypothalamic expression of aminopeptidase A and decreases were noted in the levels of AngII, AngIV and AngIII. These results support that the type of dietary fat is able to modify the hypothalamic profile of RAS and the body energy balance, related to changes in lipid metabolism.
33639986/Etoricoxib is safe and effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after primary total hip arthroplasty Background Heterotopic ossifications are a common complication after total hip arthroplasty. Low-dose radiation therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have proven to effectively reduce the rate of heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. However, a low number of studies describe an equal efficiency of etoricoxib. This work shows first results on the examination of a larger group with 194 subjects to analyze efficiency and rate of side effects under treatment with etoricoxib. Methods Clinical examinations were performed the day before surgery and after at least 12 months. The survey of clinical and functional outcome was done with Harris Hip Score (HHS). Conventional antero-posterior radiographs and second plane in frog leg position were assessed. Results In total, 14 undesirable side effects (7.4%) and only four early terminations of therapy (2.1%) were documented. A complete 1-year follow-up examination including radiographs could be done in 143 subjects (79.4%). Only 28 subjects (19.6%) developed heterotopic ossifications from which 92.9% were classified in type 1 and 7.1% in type 2 using the method described by Brooker. The results do not show correlations with body mass index, extended treatment (more than ten days), or clinical and functional outcome (measured by "Harris Hip Score"). However, male subjects show a significantly higher rate of heterotopic ossifications. Conclusions The investigations presented in this study confirm a good efficiency of etoricoxib for the prevention of heterotopic ossifications in comparison with classical methods such as radiation or drug therapy and show a low rate of undesirable side effects.
33639957/The efficacy and safety of fast track surgery (FTS) in patients after hip fracture surgery: a meta-analysis Background Fast track surgery (FTS) has been gradually applied in perioperative management of orthopedic surgery, but there still some research suspected that the prognosis of patients is not as expected and the cost is high, the effect of the FTS still urgently needed for support by evidence-based medicine. Methods We retrieved RCTs from medical research literature databases. Risk ratios (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the primary and safety endpoints. Results Overall, a total of 8886 patients were retrieved from 57 articles, of which 4448 patients (50.06%) were randomized to experimental group whereas 4438 patients (49.94%) were randomized to control group. The result showed that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay (LOS), decrease the visual analog scale (VAS), reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve Harris hip joint function score. The incidence of complications such as respiratory system infection, urinary system infection, venous thrombus embolism (VTE), pressure sore, incision infection, constipation, and prosthesis dislocation also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS improved patients' satisfaction apparently. Conclusions This meta-analysis reveals that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay, alleviate the pain, reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve hip function. The incidence of complications also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS has been spoken highly in patients in terms of nursing satisfaction. Its efficacy and safety were proved to be reliable. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13018-021-02277-w.
33562891/Do Only Calcium and Vitamin D Matter? Micronutrients in the Diet of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Patients and the Risk of Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is one of the most common extraintestinal complications among patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases. The role of vitamin D and calcium in the prevention of a decreased bone mineral density is well known, although other nutrients, including micronutrients, are also of extreme importance. Despite the fact that zinc, copper, selenium, iron, cadmium, silicon and fluorine have not been frequently discussed with regard to the prevention of osteoporosis, it is possible that a deficiency or excess of the abovementioned elements may affect bone mineralization. Additionally, the risk of malnutrition, which is common in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, as well as the composition of gut microbiota, may be associated with micronutrients status.
33562644/Na+/H+ Exchangers Involve in Regulating the pH-Sensitive Ion Channels in Mouse Sperm Sperm-specific K+ ion channel (KSper) and Ca2+ ion channel (CatSper), whose elimination causes male infertility in mice, determine the membrane potential and Ca2+ influx, respectively. KSper and CatSper can be activated by cytosolic alkalization, which occurs during sperm going through the alkaline environment of the female reproductive tract. However, which intracellular pH (pHi) regulator functionally couples to the activation of KSper/CatSper remains obscure. Although Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) have been implicated to mediate pHi in sperm, there is a lack of direct evidence confirming the functional coupling between NHEs and KSper/CatSper. Here, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), an NHEs inhibitor that firstly proved not to affect KSper/CatSper directly, was chosen to examine NHEs function on KSper/CatSper in mouse sperm. The results of patch clamping recordings showed that, when extracellular pH was at the physiological level of 7.4, DMA application caused KSper inhibition and the depolarization of membrane potential when pipette solutions were not pH-buffered. In contrast, these effects were minimized when pipette solutions were pH-buffered, indicating that they solely resulted from pHi acidification caused by NHEs inhibition. Similarly, DMA treatment reduced CatSper current and intracellular Ca2+, effects also dependent on the buffer capacity of pH in pipette solutions. The impairment of sperm motility was also observed after DMA incubation. These results manifested that NHEs activity is coupled to the activation of KSper/CatSper under physiological conditions.
33562750/Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation in Early Life on Children's Growth and Body Composition: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Background: Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy or infancy is associated with adverse growth in children. No systematic review has been conducted to summarize available evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and infancy on growth and body composition in children. Objective: We aim to summarize the available evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and infancy on child growth and body composition. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the effects of vitamin D supplementation during early life on children's growth and body composition (bone, lean and fat). A literature search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to identify relevant studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and infancy on children's body composition (bone, lean and fat) in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library from inception to 31 December 2020. A Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool was used for quality assessment. The comparison was vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo or standard care. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted. The effects are presented as mean differences (MDs) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 3960 participants from eleven randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was associated with higher triceps skinfold thickness (mm) (MD 0.33, 95% CI, 0.12, 0.54; I2 = 34%) in neonates. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy or infancy was associated with significantly increased length for age z-score in infants at 1 year of age (MD 0.29, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.54; I2 = 0%), and was associated with lower body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.34, -0.04; I2 = 0%) and body mass index z-score (BMIZ) (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.21, -0.04; I2 = 0%) in offspring at 3-6 years of age. Vitamin D supplementation during early life was not observed to be associated with children's bone, lean or fat mass. Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy or infancy may be associated with reduced adiposity in childhood. Further large clinical trials of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on childhood body composition are warranted.
33562813/Cells Lacking PA200 Adapt to Mitochondrial Dysfunction by Enhancing Glycolysis via Distinct Opa1 Processing The conserved Blm10/PA200 proteins are proteasome activators. Previously, we identified PA200-enriched regions in the genome of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq analysis. We also found that selective mitochondrial inhibitors induced PA200 redistribution in the genome. Collectively, our data indicated that PA200 regulates cellular homeostasis at the transcriptional level. In the present study, our aim is to investigate the impact of stable PA200 depletion (shPA200) on the overall transcriptome of SH-SY5Y cells. RNA-seq data analysis reveals that the genetic ablation of PA200 leads to overall changes in the transcriptional landscape of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. PA200 activates and represses genes regulating metabolic processes, such as the glycolysis and mitochondrial function. Using metabolic assays in live cells, we showed that stable knockdown of PA200 does not change basal respiration. Spare respiratory capacity and proton leak however are slightly, yet significantly, reduced in PA200-deficient cells by 99.834% and 84.147%, respectively, compared to control. Glycolysis and glycolytic capacity show a 42.186% and 26.104% increase in shPA200 cells, respectively, compared to control. These data suggest a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis especially when cells are exposed to oligomycin-induced stress. Furthermore, we observed a preserved long and compact tubular mitochondrial morphology after inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin, which might be associated with the glycolytic change of shPA200 cells. The present study also demonstrates that the proteolytic cleavage of Opa1 is affected, and that the level of OMA1 is significantly reduced in shPA200 cells upon oligomycin-induced mitochondrial insult. Together, these findings suggest a role for PA200 in the regulation of metabolic changes in response to selective inhibition of ATP synthase in an in vitro cellular model.
33562503/The "Fat but Fit" Paradigm and Bone Health in Young Adults: A Cluster Analysis The fat but fit paradox has suggested that obese individuals with good fitness levels have lower cardiometabolic risk compared to individuals with normal weight but lower fitness levels. This paradigm has not been explored in the context of bone health. The aim of this study was to test whether categories of fat but fit paradigm assessed by body fat percentage and handgrip strength holds up in young adults and to analyze the relationship between fat but fit categories and bone outcomes. Cluster cross-sectional analyses of data from 499 young adults aged 18 to 30 from Toledo and Cuenca, Spain were conducted. Body fat percentage, handgrip strength, bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and dietary nutrients such as, proteins, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamin D were assessed. Cluster analysis of body fat percentage and handgrip z scores resulted in a classification of four clusters that could be interpreted according to Fat Unfit (FU), Unfat Unfit (UU), Fat Fit (FF) and Unfat Fit (UF) categories. ANCOVA models showed that young adults in clusters with higher handgrip strength levels (FF, UF) and with higher key bone nutrients levels (UF) had significantly higher total BMC values than their peers in the UU and FU cluster categories, after controlling for sex, age and height. This study provides two novel conclusions in relation to the fat but fit paradigm: first, it confirms the construct of the four clusters of body fat percentage and handgrip strength, and second, it reinforces the predictive validity of the fat but fit paradigm categories, indicating the positive effect, although it may not just be a causal relationship, of muscular strength and key bone nutrients on counteracting the negative effect of obesity on bone health.
33572076/PEG-Coated Large Mesoporous Silicas as Smart Platform for Protein Delivery and Their Use in a Collagen-Based Formulation for 3D Printing Silica-based mesoporous systems have gained great interest in drug delivery applications due to their excellent biocompatibility and high loading capability. However, these materials face challenges in terms of pore-size limitations since they are characterized by nanopores ranging between 6-8 nm and thus unsuitable to host large molecular weight molecules such as proteins, enzymes and growth factors (GFs). In this work, for an application in the field of bone regeneration, large-pore mesoporous silicas (LPMSs) were developed to vehicle large biomolecules and release them under a pH stimulus. Considering bone remodeling, the proposed pH-triggered mechanism aims to mimic the release of GFs encased in the bone matrix due to bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCs) and the associated pH drop. To this aim, LPMSs were prepared by using 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene (TMB) as a swelling agent and the synthesis solution was hydrothermally treated and the influence of different process temperatures and durations on the resulting mesostructure was investigated. The synthesized particles exhibited a cage-like mesoporous structure with accessible pores of diameter up to 23 nm. LPMSs produced at 140  C for 24 h showed the best compromise in terms of specific surface area, pores size and shape and hence, were selected for further experiments. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as model protein to evaluate the ability of the LPMSs to adsorb and release large biomolecules. After HRP-loading, LPMSs were coated with a pH-responsive polymer, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), allowing the release of the incorporated biomolecules in response to a pH decrease, in an attempt to mimic GFs release in bone under the acidic pH generated by the resorption activity of OCs. The reported results proved that PEG-coated carriers released HRP more quickly in an acidic environment, due to the protonation of PEG at low pH that catalyzes polymer hydrolysis reaction. Our findings indicate that LPMSs could be used as carriers to deliver large biomolecules and prove the effectiveness of PEG as pH-responsive coating. Finally, as proof of concept, a collagen-based suspension was obtained by incorporating PEG-coated LPMS carriers into a type I collagen matrix with the aim of designing a hybrid formulation for 3D-printing of bone scaffolds.
33572217/Maternal Diet Influences Fetal Growth but Not Fetal Kidney Volume in an Australian Indigenous Pregnancy Cohort Suboptimal nutrition during pregnancy is recognised as a significant modifiable determinant in the development of chronic disease in offspring in later life. The current study aimed: (i) to assess the dietary intakes of pregnant Indigenous Australian women against national recommendations and (ii) to investigate the associations between maternal nutrition during pregnancy and the growth of the offspring, including kidney development in late gestation in the Gomeroi gaaynggal cohort (n = 103). Maternal dietary intake in the third trimester was assessed using the Australian Eating Survey Food Frequency Questionnaire. Estimated fetal weight (EFW) and kidney size were obtained by ultrasound. Birth weight was retrieved from hospital birth records. Of the five key nutrients for optimal reproductive health (folate, iron, calcium, zinc and fibre), the nutrients with the highest percentage of pregnant women achieving the nutrient reference values (NRVs) were zinc (75.7%) and folate (57.3%), whereas iron was the lowest. Only four people achieved all NRVs (folate, iron, calcium, zinc and fibre) important in pregnancy. Sodium and saturated fat intake exceeded recommended levels and diet quality was low, with a median score of 28 out of 73 points. After adjusting for smoking and pre-pregnancy body mass index, only maternal intake of retinol equivalents and the proportion of energy from nutrient-dense or energy-dense, nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods were associated with fetal growth. EFW decreased by 0.13 g and birth weight decreased by 0.24 g for every microg increase in maternal dietary retinol intake. Interestingly, EFW, but not actual birth weight, was positively associated with percentage energy from nutrient dense foods and negatively associated with percentage energy from EDNP foods. Dietary supplement usage was associated with increased birthweight, most significantly iron and folate supplementation. Current dietary intakes of pregnant Australian women from this cohort do not align with national guidelines. Furthermore, current findings show that maternal retinol intake and diet composition during pregnancy can influence fetal growth, but not fetal kidney growth in late gestation. Strategies that aim to support and optimise nutrient intakes of Indigenous pregnant women are urgently needed. Future studies with long-term follow-up of the children in the current cohort to assess renal damage and blood pressure are imperative.
33561995/Minocycline Impact on Redox Homeostasis of Normal Human Melanocytes HEMn-LP Exposed to UVA Radiation and Hydrogen Peroxide Minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic. In addition to its antibacterial activity, minocycline shows many non-antibiotic, beneficial effects, including antioxidative action. The property is responsible, e.g., for anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects of the drug. However, long-term pharmacotherapy with minocycline may lead to hyperpigmentation of the skin. The reasons for the pigmentation disorders include the deposition of the drug and its metabolites in melanin-containing cells and the stimulation of melanogenesis. The adverse drug reaction raises a question about the influence of the drug on melanocyte homeostasis. The study aimed to assess the effect of minocycline on redox balance in human normal melanocytes HEMn-LP exposed to hydrogen peroxide and UVA radiation. The obtained results indicate that minocycline induced oxidative stress in epidermal human melanocytes. The drug inhibited cell proliferation, decreased the level of reduced thiols, and stimulated the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The described changes were accompanied by an increase in the intracellular level of ROS. On the other hand, pretreatment with minocycline at the same concentrations increased cell viability and significantly attenuated the oxidative stress in melanocytes exposed to hydrogen peroxide and UVA radiation. Moreover, the molecular docking analysis revealed that the different influence of minocycline and other tetracyclines on CAT activity can be related to the location of the binding site.
33562610/The Ribosome-Binding Mode of Trichothecene Mycotoxins Rationalizes Their Structure:Activity Relationships Trichothecenes are the most prevalent mycotoxins contaminating cereal grains. Some of them are also considered as the virulence factors of Fusarium head blight disease. However, the mechanism behind the structure-activity relationship for trichothecenes remains unexplained. Filling this information gap is a crucial step for developing strategies to manage this large family of mycotoxins in food and feed. Here, we perform an in-depth re-examination of the existing structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome complexed with three different trichothecenes. Multiple binding interactions between trichothecenes and 25S rRNA, including hydrogen bonds, nonpolar pi stacking interactions and metal ion coordination interactions, are identified as important binding determinants. These interactions are mainly contributed by the key structural elements to the toxicity of trichothecenes, including the oxygen in the 12,13-epoxide ring and a double bond between C9 and C10. In addition, the C3-OH group also participates in binding. The comparison of three trichothecenes binding to the ribosome, along with their binding pocket architecture, suggests that the substitutions at different positions impact trichothecenes binding in two different patterns. Moreover, the binding of trichothecenes induced conformation changes of several nucleotide bases in 25S rRNA. This then provides a structural framework for understanding the structure-activity relationships apparent in trichothecenes. This study will facilitate the development of strategies aimed at detoxifying mycotoxins in food and feed and at improving the resistance of cereal crops to Fusarium fungal diseases.
33562431/Reciprocal Changes in miRNA Expression with Pigmentation and Decreased Proliferation Induced in Mouse B16F1 Melanoma Cells by l-Tyrosine and 5-Bromo-2'-Deoxyuridine Background: Many microRNAs have been identified as critical mediators in the progression of melanoma through its regulation of genes involved in different cellular processes such as melanogenesis, cell cycle control, and senescence. However, microRNAs' concurrent participation in syngeneic mouse B16F1 melanoma cells simultaneously induced decreased proliferation and differential pigmentation by exposure to 5-Brd-2'-dU (5'Bromo-2-deoxyuridine) and L-Tyr (L-Tyrosine) respectively, is poorly understood. Aim: To evaluate changes in the expression of microRNAs and identify which miRNAs in-network may contribute to the functional bases of phenotypes of differential pigmentation and reduction of proliferation in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to 5-Brd-2'-dU and L-Tyr. Methods: Small RNAseq evaluation of the expression profiles of miRNAs in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to 5-Brd-2'-dU (2.5 mug/mL) and L-Tyr (5 mM), as well as the expression by qRT-PCR of some molecular targets related to melanogenesis, cell cycle, and senescence. By bioinformatic analysis, we constructed network models of regulation and co-expression of microRNAs. Results: We confirmed that stimulation or repression of melanogenesis with L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2'-dU, respectively, generated changes in melanin concentration, reduction in proliferation, and changes in expression of microRNAs 470-3p, 470-5p, 30d-5p, 129-5p, 148b-3p, 27b-3p, and 211-5p, which presented patterns of coordinated and reciprocal co-expression, related to changes in melanogenesis through their putative targets Mitf, Tyr and Tyrp1, and control of cell cycle and senescence: Cyclin D1, Cdk2, Cdk4, p21, and p27. Conclusions: These findings provide insights into the molecular biology of melanoma of the way miRNAs are coordinated and reciprocal expression that may operate in a network as molecular bases for understanding changes in pigmentation and decreased proliferation induced in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2'-dU.
33562632/Diphlorethohydroxycarmalol Isolated from Ishige okamurae Exerts Vasodilatory Effects via Calcium Signaling and PI3K/Akt/eNOS Pathway Nitric oxide (NO) is released by endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to enhance vasodilation. Marine polyphenols are known to have protective effects against vascular dysfunction and hypertension. The present study is the first to investigate how diphlorethohydroxycarmalol (DPHC) isolated from Ishige okamurae affects calcium levels, resulting in enhanced vasodilation. We examined calcium modulation with the well-known receptors, acetylcholine receptor (AchR) and vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2), which are related to NO formation, and further confirmed the vasodilatory effect of DPHC. We confirmed that DPHC stimulated NO production by increasing calcium levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. DPHC affected AchR and VEGFR2 expression, thereby influencing transient calcium intake. Specific antagonists, atropine and SU5416, were used to verify our findings. Furthermore, based on the results of in vivo experiments, we treated Tg(flk:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish with DPHC to confirm its vasodilatory effect. In conclusion, the present study showed that DPHC modulated calcium transit through AchR and VEGFR2, increasing endothelial-dependent NO production. Thus, DPHC, a natural marine component, can efficiently ameliorate cardiovascular diseases by improving vascular function.
33562049/HVCN1 but Not Potassium Channels Are Related to Mammalian Sperm Cryotolerance Little data exist about the physiological role of ion channels during the freeze-thaw process in mammalian sperm. Herein, we determined the relevance of potassium channels, including SLO1, and of voltage-gated proton channels (HVCN1) during mammalian sperm cryopreservation, using the pig as a model and through the addition of specific blockers (TEA: tetraethyl ammonium chloride, PAX: paxilline or 2-GBI: 2-guanidino benzimidazole) to the cryoprotective media at either 15  C or 5  C. Sperm quality of the control and blocked samples was performed at 30- and 240-min post-thaw, by assessing sperm motility and kinematics, plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, membrane lipid disorder, intracellular calcium levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular O2-- and H2O2 levels. General blockade of K+ channels by TEA and specific blockade of SLO1 channels by PAX did not result in alterations in sperm quality after thawing as compared to control samples. In contrast, HVCN1-blocking with 2-GBI led to a significant decrease in post-thaw sperm quality as compared to the control, despite intracellular O2-- and H2O2 levels in 2-GBI blocked samples being lower than in the control and in TEA- and PAX-blocked samples. We can thus conclude that HVCN1 channels are related to mammalian sperm cryotolerance and have an essential role during cryopreservation. In contrast, potassium channels do not seem to play such an instrumental role.
33562782/Contribution of Drugs Interfering with Protein and Cell Wall Synthesis to the Persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms: An In Vitro Model   The occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) persisters, including viable but non-culturable (VBNC) forms, subpopulations of tolerant cells that can survive high antibiotic doses, is the main reason for PA lung infections failed eradication and recurrence in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, subjected to life-long, cyclic antibiotic treatments. In this paper, we investigated the role of subinhibitory concentrations of different anti-pseudomonas antibiotics in the maintenance of persistent (including VBNC) PA cells in in vitro biofilms. Persisters were firstly selected by exposure to high doses of antibiotics and their abundance over time evaluated, using a combination of cultural, qPCR and flow cytometry assays. Two engineered GFP-producing PA strains were used. The obtained results demonstrated a major involvement of tobramycin and bacterial cell wall-targeting antibiotics in the resilience to starvation of VBNC forms, while the presence of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime/avibactam lead to their complete loss. Moreover, a positive correlation between tobramycin exposure, biofilm production and c-di-GMP levels was observed. The presented data could allow a deeper understanding of bacterial population dynamics during the treatment of recurrent PA infections and provide a reliable evaluation of the real efficacy of the antibiotic treatments against the bacterial population within the CF lung.
33562216/A Randomized Pilot Study of DASH Patterned Groceries on Serum Urate in Individuals with Gout The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet reduces serum urate (SU); however, the impact of the DASH diet has not been previously evaluated among patients with gout. We conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover pilot study to test the effects of ~$105/week ($15/day) of dietitian-directed groceries (DDG), patterned after the DASH diet, on SU, compared with self-directed grocery shopping (SDG). Participants had gout and were not taking urate lowering therapy. Each intervention period lasted 4 weeks; crossover occurred without a washout period. The primary endpoint was SU. Compliance was assessed by end-of-period fasting spot urine potassium and sodium measurements and self-reported consumption of daily servings of fruit and vegetables. We randomized 43 participants (19% women, 49% black, mean age 59 years) with 100% follow-up. Mean baseline SU was 8.1 mg/dL (SD, 0.8). During Period 1, DDG lowered SU by 0.55 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.07, 1.04) compared to SDG by 0.0 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.44, 0.44). However, after crossover (Period 2), the SU difference between groups was the opposite: SDG reduced SU by -0.48 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.98, 0.01) compared to DDG by -0.05 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.48, 0.38; P for interaction by period = 0.11). Nevertheless, DDG improved self-reported intake of fruit and vegetables (3.1 servings/day; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.8) and significantly reduced total spot urine sodium excretion by 22 percentage points (95% CI: -34.0, -8.6). Though relatively small in scale, this pilot study suggests that dietitian-directed, DASH-patterned groceries may lower SU among gout patients not on urate-lowering drugs. However, behavior intervention crossover trials without a washout period are likely vulnerable to strong carryover effects. Definitive evaluation of the DASH diet as a treatment for gout will require a controlled feeding trial, ideally with a parallel-design.
33562398/Association of Serum Levels of Zinc, Copper, and Iron with Risk of Metabolic Syndrome The association between serum concentrations of zinc, copper, or iron and the risk of metabolic syndrome are inconclusive. Therefore, we conduct a case-control study to explore the relationship between serum levels of zinc, copper, or iron and metabolic syndrome as well as each metabolic factor and insulin resistance. We enrolled 1165 adults, aged >= 40 (65.8 +- 10) years in a hospital-based population to compare the serum levels of zinc, copper, and iron between subjects with and without metabolic syndrome by using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The least square means were computed by general linear models to compare serum concentrations of zinc, copper, and iron in relation to the number of metabolic factors. The mean serum concentrations of zinc, copper, and iron were 941.91 +- 333.63 mug/L, 1043.45 +- 306.36 mug/L, and 1246.83 +- 538.13 mug/L, respectively. The odds ratios (ORs) of metabolic syndrome for the highest versus the lowest quartile were 5.83 (95% CI: 3.35-10.12; p for trend < 0.001) for zinc, 2.02 (95% CI: 1.25-3.25; p for trend: 0.013) for copper, and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.24-3.62; p for trend: 0.021) for iron after adjusting for age, sex, personal habits, body mass index, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance. Additionally, the serum zinc, copper, and iron concentrations increased as the number of metabolic factors rose (p for trend < 0.001). This was the first study to clearly demonstrate that higher serum levels of zinc, copper, and iron were associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome and the number of metabolic factors independent of BMI and insulin resistance.
33572283/Comparison of Vitamin D and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations in Human Breast Milk between 1989 and 2016-2017 Background: Breast milk is considered the optimal source of nutrition during infancy. Although the vitamin D concentration in human breast milk is generally considered poor for infants, vitamin D in breast milk is an important source for exclusively breastfed infants. Increases in vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in lactating mothers may reduce vitamin D concentrations in breast milk. This study aimed to compare vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in breast milk collected in 1989 and 2016-2017 and simultaneously analyze them with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); the association between the lifestyle of recent lactating mothers (2016-2017) and vitamin D status in human breast milk was also evaluated. Method: Lactating mothers were recruited from three regions of Japan in 1989 (n = 72) and 2016-2017 (n = 90), and milk from 3-4 months was collected in summer and winter. The samples were strictly sealed and stored at -80C until measurement. Breast milk vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Vitamin D intake, sun exposure, and sunscreen use of the lactating mothers in 2016-2017 were assessed. Results: Both vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations in breast milk were higher in the summer regardless of the survey year. Significantly lower vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations were observed in 2016-2017 compared with 1989 in summer, but no survey year difference was observed in winter. The stepwise multiple regression analyses identified season, daily outdoor activity, and suntan in the last 12 months as independent factors associated with vitamin D3 concentrations. Conclusion: The results suggest that low vitamin D status in recent lactating mothers may have decreased vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations in breast milk compared with the 1980s. These results are helpful for developing public health strategies to improve vitamin D status in lactating mothers and infants.
33562744/Antioxidant vs. Prooxidant Properties of the Flavonoid, Kaempferol, in the Presence of Cu(II) Ions: A ROS-Scavenging Activity, Fenton Reaction and DNA Damage Study Kaempferol is a flavonoid that occurs in tea and in many vegetables and fruits, including broccoli, cabbage, beans, grapes, apples, and strawberries. The efficacy of Kaempferol has been demonstrated in the treatment of breast, esophageal, cervical, ovarian, and liver cancers and leukemia, which very likely arises from its prooxidant properties and the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways. Indeed, this matter has already been the focus of a number of published studies and reviews. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the antioxidant vs. prooxidant properties of flavonoids in the presence of the redox-active metal, copper (II) ion, by means of the Fenton reaction. The specific motivation of this work is that, since an increased level of Cu(II) ions is known to be associated with many disease states such as neurological conditions (Alzheimer's disease) and cancer, any interaction between these ions and flavonoids might affect the outcome of therapeutic uses of the latter. The structure of the Cu-kaempferol complex in DMSO was investigated by means of low temperature EPR spectroscopy, which confirmed the existence of at least two distinct coordination environments around the copper (II) ion. UV vis-spectra of kaempferol and its Cu(II) complex in DMSO revealed an interaction between the 5-OH (A ring) group and the 4-CO (C ring) group of kaempferol with Cu(II) ions. An ABTS assay confirmed that kaempferol acted as an effective radical scavenger, and that this effect was further enhanced in the form of the Cu(II)-kaempferol complex. Quantitative EPR spin trapping experiments, using DMPO as the spin trap, confirmed suppression of the formation of a mixture of hydroxyl, superoxide, and methyl radicals, in a Fenton reaction system, upon coordination of kaempferol to the redox-active Cu(II) ions, by 80% with respect to the free Cu(II) ions. A viscometric study revealed a better DNA-intercalating ability of the Cu-kaempferol complex than for free kaempferol, essential for conferring anticancer activity of these substances. The results of the viscometric measurements were compared with those from a DNA damage study of Cu-kaempferol complexes in a Fenton reaction system, using gel electrophoresis. At low concentrations of kaempferol (Cu-kaempferol ratios of 1:1 and 1:2), a very weak protective effect on DNA was noted, whereas when kaempferol was present in excess, a significant DNA-protective effect was found. This can be explained if the weakly intercalated kaempferol molecules present at the surface of DNA provide protection against attack by ROS that originate from the Fenton reaction involving intercalated Cu(II)-kaempferol complexes. Following the application of ROS scavengers, L-histidine, DMSO, and SOD, gel electrophoresis confirmed the formation of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radical anions, respectively. We propose that the prooxidant properties of Cu-kaempferol complexes may provide anticancer activity of these substances. When present in excess, kaempferol displays antioxidant properties under Cu-Fenton conditions. This suggests that kaempferol might prove a suitable candidate for the prevention or treatment of oxidative stress related medical conditions that involve a disturbed metabolism of redox metals such as copper, for example, Menkes disease, and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. For the potential use of kaempferol in clinical practice, it will be necessary to optimize the dose size and critical age of the patient so that this flavonoid may be beneficial as a preventive drug against cancer and neurological disorders.
33572090/Effect of Selected Factors on the Serum 25(OH)D Concentration in Women Treated for Breast Cancer Maintaining an optimal vitamin D concentration reduces the risk of recurrence and extends survival time in patients after breast cancer treatment. Data on vitamin D deficiency among Polish women after breast cancer therapy are limited. Thus, the aim of the study was the analysis of vitamin D status in post-mastectomy patients, considering such factors as seasons, social habits, vitamin D supplementation and its measurements. The study involved 94 women after breast cancer treatment. Serum vitamin D concentration was measured, and a questionnaire, gathering demographic and clinical data regarding cancer, diet, exposure to sun radiation, and knowledge of recommendations on vitamin D supplementation, was delivered twice, in both winter and in summer. The control group consisted of 94 age-matched women with no oncological history. In women after breast cancer treatment, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency was much more frequent than in the general population. Only about half of the patients supplemented vitamin D at the beginning of the study. After the first test and the issuing of recommendations on vitamin D supplementation, the percentage of vitamin D supplemented patients increased by about 30% in study groups. The average dose of supplement also increased. None of the women that were not supplementing vitamin D and were tested again in winter had optimal 25(OH)D concentration. It was concluded that vitamin deficiency is common in women treated for breast cancer. Medical advising about vitamin D supplementation and monitoring of 25(OH)D concentration should be improved.
33562369/Folate and Cobalamin Serum Levels in Healthy Children and Adolescents and Their Association with Age, Sex, BMI and Socioeconomic Status This study proposes age- and sex-specific percentiles for serum cobalamin and folate, and analyzes the effects of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and socioeconomic status (SES) on cobalamin and folate concentrations in healthy children and adolescents. In total, 4478 serum samples provided by healthy participants (2 months-18.0 years) in the LIFE (Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases) Child population-based cohort study between 2011 and 2015 were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Continuous age-and sex-related percentiles (2.5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 97.5th) were estimated, applying Cole's LMS method. In both sexes, folate concentrations decreased continuously with age, whereas cobalamin concentration peaked between three and seven years of age and declined thereafter. Female sex was associated with higher concentrations of both vitamins in 13- to 18-year-olds and with higher folate levels in one- to five-year-olds. BMI was inversely correlated with concentrations of both vitamins, whilst SES positively affected folate but not cobalamin concentrations. To conclude, in the assessment of cobalamin and folate status, the age- and sex-dependent dynamic of the respective serum concentrations must be considered. While BMI is a determinant of both vitamin concentrations, SES is only associated with folate concentrations.
33562685/Spermatozoa Transcriptional Response and Alterations in PL Proteins Properties after Exposure of Mytilus galloprovincialis to Mercury Mercury (Hg) is an environmental pollutant that impacts human and ecosystem health. In our previous works, we reported alterations in the properties of Mytilus galloprovincialis protamine-like (PL) proteins after 24 h of exposure to subtoxic doses of toxic metals such as copper and cadmium. The present work aims to assess the effects of 24 h of exposure to 1, 10, and 100 pM HgCl2 on spermatozoa and PL proteins of Mytilus galloprovincialis. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry indicated accumulation of this metal in the gonads of exposed mussels. Further, RT-qPCR analyses showed altered expression levels of spermatozoa mt10 and hsp70 genes. In Mytilus galloprovincialis, PL proteins represent the major basic component of sperm chromatin. These proteins, following exposure of mussels to HgCl2, appeared, by SDS-PAGE, partly as aggregates and showed a decreased DNA-binding capacity that rendered them unable to prevent DNA damage, in the presence of CuCl2 and H2O2. These results demonstrate that even these doses of HgCl2 exposure could affect the properties of PL proteins and result in adverse effects on the reproductive system of this organism. These analyses could be useful in developing rapid and efficient chromatin-based genotoxicity assays for pollution biomonitoring programs.
33572115/The Effect of Neddylation Inhibition on Inflammation-Induced MMP9 Gene Expression in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Inhibition of the protein neddylation process by the small-molecule inhibitor MLN4924 has been recently indicated as a promising direction for cancer treatment. However, the knowledge of all biological consequences of MLN4924 for cancer cells is still incomplete. Here, we report that MLN4924 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-driven cell migration. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gelatin zymography, we found that MLN4924 inhibited expression and activity of MMP9 at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in both resting cells and cells stimulated with TNF-alpha, and this inhibition was closely related to impaired cell migration. We also revealed that MLN4924, similar to TNF-alpha, induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B-alpha (IkappaB-alpha). However, contrary to TNF-alpha, MLN4924 did not induce IkappaB-alpha degradation in treated cells. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear IkappaB-alpha which formed complexes with nuclear factor kappa B p65 subunit (NFkappaB/p65) was found to be highly phosphorylated at Ser32 in the cells treated with MLN4924, but not in the cells treated with TNF-alpha alone. Moreover, in the presence of MLN4924, nuclear NFkappaB/p65 complexes were found to be enriched in c-Jun and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (CDKN1A/p21) proteins. In these cells, NFkappaB/p65 was unable to bind to the MMP9 gene promoter, which was confirmed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Taken together, our findings identified MLN4924 as a suppressor of TNF-alpha-induced MMP9-driven cell migration in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), likely acting by affecting the nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system that governs NFkappaB/p65 complex formation and its DNA binding activity in regard to the MMP9 promoter, suggesting that inhibition of neddylation might be a new therapeutic strategy to prevent invasion/metastasis in ESCC patients.
33562493/Characterization and Reconstitution of Human Lipoyl Synthase (LIAS) Supports ISCA2 and ISCU as Primary Cluster Donors and an Ordered Mechanism of Cluster Assembly Lipoyl synthase (LIAS) is an iron-sulfur cluster protein and a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily that catalyzes the final step of lipoic acid biosynthesis. The enzyme contains two [4Fe-4S] centers (reducing and auxiliary clusters) that promote radical formation and sulfur transfer, respectively. Most information concerning LIAS and its mechanism has been determined from prokaryotic enzymes. Herein, we detail the expression, isolation, and characterization of human LIAS, its reactivity, and evaluation of natural iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster reconstitution mechanisms. Cluster donation by a number of possible cluster donor proteins and heterodimeric complexes has been evaluated. [2Fe-2S]-cluster-bound forms of human ISCU and ISCA2 were found capable of reconstituting human LIAS, such that complete product turnover was enabled for LIAS, as monitored via a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of native LIAS and substituted derivatives that lacked the ability to bind one or the other of LIAS's two [4Fe-4S] clusters revealed a likely order of cluster addition, with the auxiliary cluster preceding the reducing [4Fe-4S] center. These results detail the trafficking of Fe-S clusters in human cells and highlight differences with respect to bacterial LIAS analogs. Likely in vivo Fe-S cluster donors to LIAS are identified, with possible connections to human disease states, and a mechanistic ordering of [4Fe-4S] cluster reconstitution is evident. 
33572228/Potential of Creatine in Glucose Management and Diabetes Creatine is one of the most popular supplements worldwide, and it is frequently used by both athletic and non-athletic populations to improve power, strength, muscle mass and performance. A growing body of evidence has been identified potential therapeutic effects of creatine in a wide variety of clinical conditions, such as cancer, muscle dystrophy and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence has suggested that creatine supplementation alone, and mainly in combination with exercise training, may improve glucose metabolism in health individuals and insulin-resistant individuals, such as in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Creatine itself may stimulate insulin secretion in vitro, improve muscle glycogen stores and ameliorate hyperglycemia in animals. In addition, exercise induces numerous metabolic benefits, including increases in insulin-independent muscle glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. It has been speculated that creatine supplementation combined with exercise training could result in additional improvements in glucose metabolism when compared with each intervention separately. The possible mechanism underlying the effects of combined exercise and creatine supplementation is an enhanced glucose transport into muscle cell by type 4 glucose transporter (GLUT-4) translocation to sarcolemma. Although preliminary findings from small-scale trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are promising, the efficacy of creatine for improving glycemic control is yet to be confirmed. In this review, we aim to explore the possible therapeutic role of creatine supplementation on glucose management and as a potential anti-diabetic intervention, summarizing the current knowledge and highlighting the research gaps.
33572199/Development of Atropa belladonna L. Plants with High-Yield Hyoscyamine and without Its Derivatives Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System Atropa belladonna L. is one of the most important herbal plants that produces hyoscyamine or atropine, and it also produces anisodamine and scopolamine. However, the in planta hyoscyamine content is very low, and it is difficult and expensive to independently separate hyoscyamine from the tropane alkaloids in A. belladonna. Therefore, it is vital to develop A. belladonna plants with high yields of hyoscyamine, and without anisodamine and scopolamine. In this study, we generated A. belladonna plants without anisodamine and scopolamine, via the CRISPR/Cas9-based disruption of hyoscyamine 6beta-hydroxylase (AbH6H), for the first time. Hyoscyamine production was significantly elevated, while neither anisodamine nor scopolamine were produced, in the A. belladonna plants with homozygous mutations in AbH6H. In summary, new varieties of A. belladonna with high yields of hyoscyamine and without anisodamine and scopolamine have great potential applicability in producing hyoscyamine at a low cost.
33562121/Differential Regulation of Bilastine Affinity for Human Histamine H1 Receptors by Lys 179 and Lys 191 via Its Binding Enthalpy and Entropy Bilastine, a zwitterionic second-generation antihistamine containing a carboxyl group, has higher selectivity for H1 receptors than first-generation antihistamines. Ligand-receptor docking simulations have suggested that the electrostatic interaction between the carboxyl group of second-generation antihistamines and the amino group of Lys179ECL2 and Lys1915.39 of human H1 receptors might contribute to increased affinity of these antihistamines to H1 receptors. In this study, we evaluated the roles of Lys179ECL2 and Lys1915.39 in regulating the electrostatic and hydrophobic binding of bilastine to H1 receptors by thermodynamic analyses. The binding enthalpy and entropy of bilastine were estimated from the van 't Hoff equation using the dissociation constants. These constants were obtained from the displacement curves against the binding of [3H] mepyramine to membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type human H1 receptors and their Lys179ECL2 or Lys1915.39 mutants to alanine at various temperatures. We found that the binding of bilastine to wild-type H1 receptors occurred by enthalpy-dependent binding forces and, more dominantly, entropy-dependent binding forces. The mutation of Lys179ECL2 and Lys1915.39 to alanine reduced the affinity of bilastine to H1 receptors by reducing enthalpy- and entropy-dependent binding forces, respectively. These results suggest that Lys179ECL2 and Lys1915.39 differentially contribute to the increased binding affinity to bilastine via electrostatic and hydrophobic binding forces.
33572290/CD9 Upregulation-Decreased CCL21 Secretion in Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reduces Cancer Cell Migration Tetraspanin CD9 is widely expressed on various cell types, such as cancer cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and/or cell-released exosomes. It has been reported that exosomal CD9 plays an important role in intercellular communications involved in cancer cell migration and metastasis. However, reports on the effect of the CD9 of MSCs or MSC-derived exosomes on cancer cell migration are still lacking. In this study, using a transwell migration assay, we found that both dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (dex-IO NPs) and ionomycin stimulated exosomal CD9 expression in human MSCs (hMSCs); however, hMSCs could not deliver them to melanoma cells to affect cell migration. Interestingly, a reduced migration of melanoma cell line was observed when the ionomycin-incubated hMSC-conditioned media but not dex-IO NP-labeled hMSC-conditioned media were in the bottom chamber. In addition, we found that dex-IO NPs decreased cellular CD9 expression in hMSCs but ionomycin increased this. Simultaneously, we found that ionomycin suppressed the expression and secretion of the chemokine CCL21 in hMSCs. The silencing of CD9 demonstrated an inhibitory role of cellular CD9 in CCL21 expression in hMSCs, suggesting that ionomycin could upregulate cellular CD9 to decrease CCL21 expression and secretion of hMSCs, which would reduce the migration of B16F10, A549 and U87MG cancer cell lines due to chemoattraction reduction of CCL21. The present study not only highlights the important role of bone marrow-derived hMSCs' CD9-mediated CCL21 regulation in cancer bone metastasis but also suggests a new distinct pharmaceutical strategy for prevention or/and therapy of cancer metastasis.
33562002/Inhibitors of Nucleotide Excision Repair Decrease UVB-Induced Mutagenesis:An In Vitro Study The high incidence of skin cancers in the Caucasian population is primarily due to the accumulation of DNA damage in epidermal cells induced by chronic ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure. UVB-induced DNA photolesions, including cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), promote mutations in skin cancer driver genes. In humans, CPDs are repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Several commonly used and investigational medications negatively influence NER in experimental systems. Despite these molecules' ability to decrease NER activity in vitro, the role of these drugs in enhancing skin cancer risk is unclear. In this study, we investigated four molecules (veliparib, resveratrol, spironolactone, and arsenic trioxide) with well-known NER-inhibitory potential in vitro, using UVB-irradiated CHO epithelial and HaCaT immortalized keratinocyte cell lines. Relative CPD levels, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene mutation frequency, cell viability, cell cycle progression, and protein expression were assessed. All four molecules significantly elevated CPD levels in the genome 24 h after UVB irradiation. However, veliparib, spironolactone, and arsenic trioxide reduced the mutagenic potential of UVB, while resveratrol did not alter UVB-induced mutation formation. UVB-induced apoptosis was enhanced by spironolactone and arsenic-trioxide treatment, while veliparib caused significantly prolonged cell cycle arrest and increased autophagy. Spironolactone also enhanced the phosphorylation level of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), while arsenic trioxide modified UVB-driven mitochondrial fission. Resveratrol induced only mild changes in the cellular UVB response. Our results show that chemically inhibited NER does not result in increased mutagenic effects. Furthermore, the UVB-induced mutagenic potential can be paradoxically mitigated by NER-inhibitor molecules. We identified molecular changes in the cellular UVB response after NER-inhibitor treatment, which may compensate for the mitigated DNA repair. Our findings show that metabolic cellular response pathways are essential to consider in evaluating the skin cancer risk-modifying effects of pharmacological compounds.
33572104/Robust Ruthenium Catalysts Supported on Mesoporous Cyclodextrin-Templated TiO2-SiO2 Mixed Oxides for the Hydrogenation of Levulinic Acid to gamma-Valerolactone In this paper, we present a versatile template-directed colloidal self-assembly method for the fabrication in aqueous phase of composition-tuned mesoporous RuO2@TiO2-SiO2 catalysts. Randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin/Pluronic F127 supramolecular assemblies were used as soft templates, TiO2 colloids as building blocks, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as a silica source. Catalysts were characterized at different stages of their synthesis using dynamic light scattering, N2-adsorption analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, high-angle annular bright-field and dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, together with EDS elemental mapping. Results revealed that both the supramolecular template and the silica loading had a strong impact on the pore characteristics and crystalline structure of the mixed oxides, as well as on the morphology of the RuO2 nanocrystals. Their catalytic performance was then evaluated in the aqueous phase hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to gamma-valerolactone (GVL) under mild conditions (50  C, 50 bar H2). Results showed that the cyclodextrin-derived catalyst displayed almost quantitative LA conversion and 99% GVL yield in less than one hour. Moreover, this catalyst could be reused at least five times without loss of activity. This work offers an effective approach to the utilization of cyclodextrins for engineering the surface morphology of Ru nanocrystals and pore characteristics of TiO2-based materials for catalytic applications in hydrogenation reactions.
33562748/Discovery of a Small Molecule Inhibitor of Human Adenovirus Capable of Preventing Escape from the Endosome Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) display a wide range of tissue tropism and can cause an array of symptoms from mild respiratory illnesses to disseminated and life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. However, no antiviral drug has been approved specifically for the treatment of HAdV infections. Herein, we report our continued efforts to optimize salicylamide derivatives and discover compound 16 (JMX0493) as a potent inhibitor of HAdV infection. Compound 16 displays submicromolar IC50 values, a higher selectivity index (SI > 100) and 2.5-fold virus yield reduction compared to our hit compound niclosamide. Moreover, unlike niclosamide, our mechanistic studies suggest that the antiviral activity of compound 16 against HAdV is achieved through the inhibition of viral particle escape from the endosome, which bars subsequent uncoating and the presentation of lytic protein VI.
33562048/Preclinical Evaluation of [18F]FACH in Healthy Mice and Piglets: An 18F-Labeled Ligand for Imaging of Monocarboxylate Transporters with PET The expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) is linked to pathophysiological changes in diseases, including cancer, such that MCTs could potentially serve as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets. We recently developed [18F]FACH as a radiotracer for non-invasive molecular imaging of MCTs by positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to evaluate further the specificity, metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetics of [18F]FACH in healthy mice and piglets. We measured the [18F]FACH plasma protein binding fractions in mice and piglets and the specific binding in cryosections of murine kidney and lung. The biodistribution of [18F]FACH was evaluated by tissue sampling ex vivo and by dynamic PET/MRI in vivo, with and without pre-treatment by the MCT inhibitor alpha-CCA-Na or the reference compound, FACH-Na. Additionally, we performed compartmental modelling of the PET signal in kidney cortex and liver. Saturation binding studies in kidney cortex cryosections indicated a KD of 118 +- 12 nM and Bmax of 6.0 pmol/mg wet weight. The specificity of [18F]FACH uptake in the kidney cortex was confirmed in vivo by reductions in AUC0-60min after pre-treatment with alpha-CCA-Na in mice (-47%) and in piglets (-66%). [18F]FACH was metabolically stable in mouse, but polar radio-metabolites were present in plasma and tissues of piglets. The [18F]FACH binding potential (BPND) in the kidney cortex was approximately 1.3 in mice. The MCT1 specificity of [18F]FACH uptake was confirmed by displacement studies in 4T1 cells. [18F]FACH has suitable properties for the detection of the MCTs in kidney, and thus has potential as a molecular imaging tool for MCT-related pathologies, which should next be assessed in relevant disease models.
33562773/Hiltonol Cocktail Kills Lung Cancer Cells by Activating Cancer-Suppressors, PKR/OAS, and Restraining the Tumor Microenvironment NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Clinical trials showed that Hiltonol, a stable dsRNA representing an advanced form of polyI:C (polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid), is an adjuvant cancer-immunomodulator. However, its mechanisms of action and effect on lung cancer have not been explored pre-clinically. Here, we examined, for the first time, how a novel Hiltonol cocktail kills NSCLC cells. By retrospective analysis of NSCLC patient tissues obtained from the tumor biobank; pre-clinical studies with Hiltonol alone or Hiltonol+++ cocktail [Hiltonol+anti-IL6+AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor)+Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor)]; cytokine analysis; gene knockdown and gain/loss-of-function studies, we uncovered the mechanisms of action of Hiltonol+++. We demonstrated that Hiltonol+++ kills the cancer cells and suppresses the metastatic potential of NSCLC through: (i) upregulation of pro-apoptotic Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, (ii) induction of cytosolic cytochrome c, (iii) modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (GRO, MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-6) and anticancer IL-24 in NSCLC subtypes, and (iv) upregulation of tumor suppressors, PKR (protein kinase R) and OAS (2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase). In silico analysis showed that Lys296 of PKR and Lys66 of OAS interact with Hiltonol. These Lys residues are purportedly involved in the catalytic/signaling activity of the tumor suppressors. Furthermore, knockdown of PKR/OAS abrogated the anticancer action of Hiltonol, provoking survival of cancer cells. Ex vivo analysis of NSCLC patient tissues corroborated that loss of PKR and OAS is associated with cancer advancement. Altogether, our findings unraveled the significance of studying tumor biobank tissues, which suggests PKR and OAS as precision oncological suppressor candidates to be targeted by this novel Hiltonol+++ cocktail which represents a prospective drug for development into a potent and tailored therapy for NSCLC subtypes.
33572364/Effect of Monosodium Glutamate on Saltiness and Palatability Ratings of Low-Salt Solutions in Japanese Adults According to Their Early Salt Exposure or Salty Taste Preference Using umami can help reduce excessive salt intake, which contributes to cardiovascular disease. Differences in salt-exposed environment at birth and preference for the salty taste might affect the sense of taste. Focusing on these two differences, we investigated the effect of monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) on the saltiness and palatability of low-salt solutions. Japanese participants (64 men, 497 women, aged 19-86 years) tasted 0.3%, 0.6%, and 0.9% NaCl solutions with or without 0.3% MSG to evaluate saltiness and palatability. They were also asked about their birthplace, personal salty preference, and family salty preference. Adding MSG enhanced saltiness, especially in the 0.3% NaCl solution, while the effect was attenuated in the 0.6% and 0.9% NaCl solutions. Palatability was rated higher with MSG than without MSG for each NaCl solution, with a peak value for the 0.3% NaCl solution with MSG. There was no difference in the effect of umami ingredients on palatability between the average salt intake by the regional block at birth and salty preference (all p > 0.05). Thus, adding an appropriate amount of umami ingredients can facilitate salt reduction in diet while maintaining palatability regardless of the salt-exposed environment in early childhood or salty preference.
33562655/Cutting Edge of the Pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis: Sphingomyelin Deacylase, the Enzyme Involved in Its Ceramide Deficiency, Plays a Pivotal Role Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized clinically by severe dry skin and functionally by both a cutaneous barrier disruption and an impaired water-holding capacity in the stratum corneum (SC) even in the nonlesional skin. The combination of the disrupted barrier and water-holding functions in nonlesional skin is closely linked to the disease severity of AD, which suggests that the barrier abnormality as well as the water deficiency are elicited as a result of the induced dermatitis and subsequently trigger the recurrence of dermatitis. These functional abnormalities of the SC are mainly attributable to significantly decreased levels of total ceramides and the altered ceramide profile in the SC. Clinical studies using a synthetic pseudo-ceramide (pCer) that can function as a natural ceramide have indicated the superior clinical efficacy of pCer and, more importantly, have shown that the ceramide deficiency rather than changes in the ceramide profile in the SC of AD patients plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. Clinical studies of infants with AD have shown that the barrier disruption due to the ceramide deficiency is not inherent and is essentially dependent on postinflammatory events in those infants. Consistently, the recovery of trans-epidermal water loss after tape-stripping occurs at a significantly slower rate only at 1 day post-tape-stripping in AD skin compared with healthy control (HC) skin. This resembles the recovery pattern observed in Niemann-Pick disease, which is caused by an acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) deficiency. Further, comparison of ceramide levels in the SC between before and after tape-stripping revealed that whereas ceramide levels in HC skin are significantly upregulated at 4 days post-tape-stripping, their ceramide levels remain substantially unchanged at 4 days post-tape-stripping. Taken together, the sum of these findings strongly suggests that an impaired homeostasis of a ceramide-generating process may be associated with these abnormalities. We have discovered a novel enzyme, sphingomyelin (SM) deacylase, which cleaves the N-acyl linkage of SM and glucosylceramide (GCer). The activity of SM deacylase is significantly increased in AD lesional epidermis as well as in the involved and uninvolved SC of AD skin, but not in the skin of patients with contact dermatitis or chronic eczema, compared with HC skin. SM deacylase competes with aSMase and beta-glucocerebrosidase (BGCase) to hydrolyze their common substrates, SM and GCer, to yield their lysoforms sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and glucosylsphingosine (GSP), respectively, instead of ceramide. Consistently, those reaction products (SPC and GSP) accumulate to a greater extent in the involved and uninvolved SC of AD skin compared with chronic eczema or contact dermatitis skin as well as HC skin. Successive chromatographies were used to purify SM deacylase to homogeneity with a single band of  43 kDa and with an enrichment of >14,000-fold. Analysis of a protein spot with SM deacylase activity separated by 2D-SDS-PAGE using MALDI-TOF MS/MS allowed its amino acid sequence to be determined and to identify it as the beta-subunit of acid ceramidase (aCDase), an enzyme consisting of alpha- and beta-subunits linked by amino-bonds and a single S-S bond. Western blotting of samples treated with 2-mercaptoethanol revealed that whereas recombinant human aCDase was recognized by antibodies to the alpha-subunit at  56 and  13 kDa and the beta-subunit at  43 kDa, the purified SM deacylase was detectable only by the antibody to the beta-subunit at  43 kDa. Breaking the S-S bond of recombinant human aCDase with dithiothreitol elicited the activity of SM deacylase with an apparent size of  40 kDa upon gel chromatography in contrast to aCDase activity with an apparent size of  50 kDa in untreated recombinant human aCDase. These results provide new insights into the essential role of SM deacylase as the beta-subunit aCDase that causes the ceramide deficiency in AD skin.
33572312/Efficient Chitosan/Nitrogen-Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide Composite Membranes for Direct Alkaline Ethanol Fuel Cells Herein, we prepared a series of nanocomposite membranes based on chitosan (CS) and three compositionally and structurally different N-doped graphene derivatives. Two-dimensional (2D) and quasi 1D N-doped reduced graphene oxides (N-rGO) and nanoribbons (N-rGONRs), as well as 3D porous N-doped graphitic polyenaminone particles (N-pEAO), were synthesized and characterized fully to confirm their graphitic structure, morphology, and nitrogen (pyridinic, pyrrolic, and quaternary or graphitic) group contents. The largest (0.07%) loading of N-doped graphene derivatives impacted the morphology of the CS membrane significantly, reducing the crystallinity, tensile properties, and the KOH uptake, and increasing (by almost 10-fold) the ethanol permeability. Within direct alkaline ethanol test cells, it was found that CS/N rGONRs (0.07 %) membrane (Pmax. = 3.7 mWcm-2) outperformed the pristine CS membrane significantly (Pmax. = 2.2 mWcm-2), suggesting the potential of the newly proposed membranes for application in direct ethanol fuel cells.
33572317/Electron-Induced Repair of 2'-Deoxyribose Sugar Radicals in DNA: A Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study In this work, we used omegaB97XD density functional and 6-31++G** basis set to study the structure, electron affinity, populations via Boltzmann distribution, and one-electron reduction potentials (E ) of 2'-deoxyribose sugar radicals in aqueous phase by considering 2'-deoxyguanosine and 2'-deoxythymidine as a model of DNA. The calculation predicted the relative stability of sugar radicals in the order C4'  > C1'  > C5'  > C3'  > C2' . The Boltzmann distribution populations based on the relative stability of the sugar radicals were not those found for ionizing radiation or OH-radical attack and are good evidence the kinetic mechanisms of the processes drive the products formed. The adiabatic electron affinities of these sugar radicals were in the range 2.6-3.3 eV which is higher than the canonical DNA bases. The sugar radicals reduction potentials (E ) without protonation (-1.8 to -1.2 V) were also significantly higher than the bases. Thus the sugar radicals will be far more readily reduced by solvated electrons than the DNA bases. In the aqueous phase, these one-electron reduced sugar radicals (anions) are protonated from solvent and thus are efficiently repaired via the "electron-induced proton transfer mechanism". The calculation shows that, in comparison to efficient repair of sugar radicals by the electron-induced proton transfer mechanism, the repair of the cyclopurine lesion, 5',8-cyclo-2'-dG, would involve a substantial barrier.
33572433/In Vitro and In Vivo Efficacy of a Novel Glucose-Methotrexate Conjugate in Targeted Cancer Treatment Methotrexate (MTX) is a commonly used antimetabolite, which inhibits folate and DNA synthesis to be effective in the treatment of various malignancies. However, MTX therapy is hindered by the lack of target tumor selectivity. We have designed, synthesized and evaluated a novel glucose-methotrexate conjugate (GLU-MTX) both in vitro and in vivo, in which a cleavable linkage allows intracellular MTX release after selective uptake through glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1). GLU-MTX inhibited the growth of colorectal (DLD-1), breast (MCF-7) and lung (A427) adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-25), osteosarcoma (MG63) cell lines, but not in WI-38 healthy fibroblasts. In tumor cells, GLU-MTX uptake increased 17-fold compared to unconjugated MTX. 4,6-O-ethylidene-alpha-D-glucose (EDG), a GLUT1 inhibitor, significantly interfered with GLU-MTX induced growth inhibition, suggesting a glucose-mediated drug uptake. Glu-MTX also caused significant tumor growth delay in vivo in breast cancer-bearing mice. These results show that our GLUT-MTX conjugate can be selectively uptake by a range of tumor cells to cause their significant growth inhibition in vitro, which was also confirmed in a breast cancer model in vivo. GLUT1 inhibitor EDG interfered with these effects verifying the selective drug uptake. Accordingly, GLU-MTX offers a considerable tumor selectivity and may offer cancer growth inhibition at reduced toxicity.
33648494/Structure-dependent absorption of atypical sphingoid long-chain bases from digestive tract into lymph Background Dietary sphingolipids have various biofunctions, including skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinoma properties. Long-chain bases (LCBs), the essential backbones of sphingolipids, are expected to be important for these bioactivities, and they vary structurally between species. Given these findings, however, the absorption dynamics of each LCB remain unclear. Methods In this study, five structurally different LCBs were prepared from glucosylceramides (GlcCers) with LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH and LCB 18:2(4E,8E);2OH moieties derived from konjac tuber (Amorphophallus konjac), from GlcCers with an LCB 18(9Me):2(4E,8E);2OH moiety derived from Tamogi mushroom (Pleurotus cornucopiae var. citrinopileatus), and from ceramide 2-aminoethyphosphonate with LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety and LCB 18(9Me):3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety derived from giant scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis), and their absorption percentages and metabolite levels were analyzed using a lymph-duct-cannulated rat model via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with a multistage fragmentation method. Results The five orally administered LCBs were absorbed and detected in chyle (lipid-containing lymph) as LCBs and several metabolites including ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingomyelins. The absorption percentages of LCBs were 0.10-1.17%, depending on their structure. The absorption percentage of LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH was the highest (1.17%), whereas that of LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH was the lowest (0.10%). The amount of sphingomyelin with an LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH moiety in chyle was particularly higher than sphingomyelins with other LCB moieties. Conclusions Structural differences among LCBs, particularly geometric isomerism at the C8-C9 position, significantly affected the absorption percentages and ratio of metabolites. This is the first report to elucidate that the absorption and metabolism of sphingolipids are dependent on their LCB structure. These results could be used to develop functional foods that are more readily absorbed.

33647040/CXCR4 inhibition with AMD3100 attenuates amphetamine induced locomotor activity in adolescent Long Evans male rats Adolescent psychostimulant abuse has been on the rise over the past decade. This trend has demonstrable ramifications on adolescent behavior and brain morphology, increasing risk for development of addiction during adolescence and in later adulthood. Neuroimmune substrates are implicated in the etiology of substance use disorders. To add to this body of work, the current study was developed to explore the role of a chemokine receptor, CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4), in the development of amphetamine (AMPH) sensitization. We targeted CXCR4 as it is implicated in developmental processes, dopaminergic transmission, neuroimmune responses, and the potentiation of psychostimulant abuse pathology. To evaluate the role of CXCR4 activity on the development of AMPH sensitization, a CXCR4 antagonist (Plerixafor; AMD3100) was administered to rats as a pretreatment variable. Specifically, adolescent Long Evans male rats (N = 37) were divided into four groups: (1) AMD3100 (IP, 4.0 mg/kg) + AMPH (IP, 4.0 mg/kg), (2) saline (SAL; 0.9% NaCl) + AMPH, (3) AMD3100 + SAL, and (4) SAL + SAL. Animals were first habituated to locomotor activity (LMA) chambers, then injected with a pretreatment drug (AMD3100 or SAL) followed by AMPH or SAL every other for four days. After a one-week withdrawal period, all animals were administered a low challenge dose of AMPH (IP, 1.0 mg/kg). AMPH-injected rats displayed significantly more locomotor activity compared to controls across all testing days. CXCR4 antagonism significantly attenuated AMPH-induced locomotor activity. On challenge day, AMD3100 pre-treated animals exhibited diminutive AMPH-induced locomotor activity compared to SAL pre-treated animals. Postmortem analyses of brain tissue revealed elevated CXCR4 protein levels in the striatum of all experimental groups. Our results implicate CXCR4 signaling in the development of AMPH sensitization and may represent an important therapeutic target for future research in psychostimulant abuse.
33647045/EGFR mutation-guided use of afatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in Hong Kong - A cost-effectiveness analysis Introduction Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy targets at epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to compare the EGFR mutation-guided target therapy versus empirical chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in the public healthcare setting of Hong Kong. Methods A Markov model was designed to simulate outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC adult patients with un-tested EGFR-sensitizing mutation status. Four treatment strategies were evaluated: Empirical first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin-pemetrexed (empirical chemotherapy group), and EGFR mutation-guided use of a TKI (afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib). Model outcome measures were direct medical cost, progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost per QALY gained (ICER) was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of model results. Results Empirical chemotherapy and EGFR mutation-guided gefitinib gained lower QALYs at higher costs than the erlotinib group. Comparing with EGFR mutation-guided erlotinib, the afatinib strategy gained additional QALYs with ICER (540,633 USD/QALY). In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic sensitivity analysis, EGFR mutation-guided afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and empirical chemotherapy were preferred strategy in 0%, 98%, 0% and 2% of time at willingness-to-pay (WTP) 47,812 USD/QALY (1x gross domestic product (GDP) per capita), and in 30%, 68%, 2% and 0% of time at WTP 143,436 USD/QALY (3x GDP per capita), respectively. Conclusions EGFR mutation-guided erlotinib appears to be the cost-effective strategy from the perspective of Hong Kong public healthcare provider over a broad range of WTP.
33647046/Population genetic structure and association mapping for iron toxicity tolerance in rice Iron (Fe) toxicity is a major abiotic stress which severely reduces rice yield in many countries of the world. Genetic variation for this stress tolerance exists in rice germplasms. Mapping of gene(s)/QTL controlling the stress tolerance and transfer of the traits into high yielding rice varieties are essential for improvement against the stress. A panel population of 119 genotypes from 352 germplasm lines was constituted for detecting the candidate gene(s)/QTL through association mapping. STRUCTURE, GenAlEx and Darwin softwares were used to classify the population. The marker-trait association was detected by considering both the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Mixed Linear Model (MLM) analyses. Wide genetic variation was observed among the genotypes present in the panel population for the stress tolerance. Linkage disequilibrium was detected in the population for iron toxicity tolerance. The population was categorized into three genetic structure groups. Marker-trait association study considering both the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Mixed Linear Model (MLM) showed significant association of leaf browning index (LBI) with markers RM471, RM3, RM590 and RM243. Three novel QTL controlling Fe-toxicity tolerance were detected and designated as qFeTox4.3, qFeTox6.1 and qFeTox10.1. A QTL reported earlier in the marker interval of C955-C885 on chromosome 1 is validated using this panel population. The present study showed that QTL controlling Fe-toxicity tolerance to be co-localized with the QTL for Fe-biofortification of rice grain indicating involvement of common pathway for Fe toxicity tolerance and Fe content in rice grain. Fe-toxicity tolerance QTL qFeTox6.1 was co-localized with grain Fe-biofortification QTLs qFe6.1 and qFe6.2 on chromosome 6, whereas qFeTox10.1 was co-localized with qFe10.1 on chromosome 10. The Fe-toxicity tolerance QTL detected from this mapping study will be useful in marker-assisted breeding programs.
33653373/Application of WALANT technique for repairing finger skin defect with a random skin flap Background Wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) technique has emerged among hand surgeons with other indications. Surgeries involving pedicled flap and revascularization are no longer used as contraindications. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and merits of the WALANT technique in random skin flap surgery. Methods From May 2018 to March 2019, 12 patients with finger skin defects repaired with random skin flaps were reviewed. Abdominal skin flaps or thoracic skin flaps were used to cover the wound. Both the fingers and the donor sites were anesthetized by the WALANT technique. A 40-mL conventional volume consisted of a mixture of epinephrine and lidocaine. A volume of 5 mL was injected at the distal palmar for nerve block, the other 5 mL was injected around the wound for hemostasis, and the remaining was injected at the donor site of flaps for both analgesia and hemostasis. Baseline data with respect to sex, age, side, type of finger, donor sites, flap size, dosage of anesthetics, usage of finger tourniquet, intraoperative and postoperative pain, hemostasis effect, operation time, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH) score, and hospitalization expense, were collected. Results All patients tolerated the procedure, and none of them needed sedation. Single finger skin defect in 8 patients and double finger skin defect occurred in 4 patients; 5 patients were repaired by abdominal skin flaps, and 7 patients were repaired by thoracic skin flaps. The good surgical field visibility was 91.7%. All flaps survived adequately, without necrosis, pulling fingers out, and other complications. The average visual analog scale (VAS) score of the maximal pain was 1.1 in fingers vs. 2.1 in donor sites during the operation. On postoperative day one, the average VAS score of the maximal pain in fingers and donor sites was 1.3 and 1.1, respectively. The average hospitalization expense before reimbursement of the whole treatment was 11% less expensive compared to the traditional method. The average QuickDASH score was 9.1. Conclusions Under wide-awake anesthesia, patients have the ability to control their injured upper extremities consciously, avoiding the complications due to pulling flap pedicles. With the merits of safety, painlessness, less bleeding, and effectivity, the WALANT technique in random skin flaps is feasible and a reliable alternative to deal with finger skin defect.
33648500/Protective role of Clitoria ternatea L. flower extract on methylglyoxal-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to DNA Background Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl precursor for the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) associated with age-related diseases, including diabetes and its complications. Clitoria ternatea L. flower has been reported to possess antioxidant and antiglycating properties. Evidence indicates that the extract of Clitoria ternatea L. flower inhibits fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to bovine serum albumin (BSA). However, there is no evidence to support the inhibitory effect of CTE against MG-mediated protein glycation and oxidative damage to protein and DNA. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether C. ternatea flower extract (CTE) prevents MG-induced protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage. Methods The formation of fluorescent AGEs in BSA was evaluated using spectrofluorometer. The protein carbonyl and thiol group content were used for detecting protein oxidation. DNA strand breakage in a glycation model comprising of MG, lysine and Cu2+ or a free radical generator 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) systems was investigated using gel electrophoresis. Generation of superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals in the MG/lysine system was assessed by the cytochrome c reduction assay and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure the MG-trapping ability. Results In the BSA/MG system, CTE (0.25-1 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs and protein oxidation by reducing protein carbonyl content as well as preventing the protein thiol depletion. The concentration of CTE at 0.125-1 mg/mL prevented oxidative DNA cleavage in MG/lysine and AAPH systems associated with the inhibition of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical formation. It also directly trapped MG in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from 15 to 43%. Conclusions The study findings suggest that the direct carbonyl trapping ability and the free radical scavenging activity of CTE are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the prevention of protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage.

33653319/Fermentative production of enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolically engineered Pantoea ananatis Background Linalool, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is extensively used in the flavor and fragrance industries and exists as two enantiomers, (S)- and (R)-linalool, which have different odors and biological properties. Linalool extraction from natural plant tissues suffers from low product yield. Although linalool can also be chemically synthesized, its enantioselective production is difficult. Microbial production of terpenes has recently emerged as a novel, environmental-friendly alternative. Stereoselective production can also be achieved using this approach via enzymatic reactions. We previously succeeded in producing enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolically engineered Pantoea ananatis, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, via the heterologous mevalonate pathway with the highest linalool titer ever reported from engineered microbes. Results Here, we genetically modified a previously developed P. ananatis strain expressing the (S)-linalool synthase (AaLINS) from Actinidia arguta to further improve (S)-linalool production. AaLINS was mostly expressed as an insoluble form in P. ananatis; its soluble expression level was increased by N-terminal fusion of a halophilic beta-lactamase from Chromohalobacter sp. 560 with hexahistidine. Furthermore, in combination with elevation of the precursor supply via the mevalonate pathway, the (S)-linalool titer was increased approximately 1.4-fold (4.7 +- 0.3 g/L) in comparison with the original strain (3.4 +- 0.2 g/L) in test-tube cultivation with an aqueous-organic biphasic fermentation system using isopropyl myristate as the organic solvent for in situ extraction of cytotoxic and semi-volatile (S)-linalool. The most productive strain, IP04S/pBLAAaLINS-ispA*, produced 10.9 g/L of (S)-linalool in "dual-phase" fed-batch fermentation, which was divided into a growth-phase and a subsequent production-phase. Thus far, this is the highest reported titer in the production of not only linalool but also all monoterpenes using microbes. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of our metabolically engineered P. ananatis strain as a platform for economically feasible (S)-linalool production and provides insights into the stereoselective production of terpenes with high efficiency. This system is an environmentally friendly and economically valuable (S)-linalool production alternative. Mass production of enantiopure (S)-linalool can also lead to accurate assessment of its biological properties by providing an enantiopure substrate for study.

33653345/Improving l-threonine production in Escherichia coli by elimination of transporters ProP and ProVWX Background Betaine, an osmoprotective compatible solute, has been used to improve l-threonine production in engineered Escherichia coli l-threonine producer. Betaine supplementation upregulates the expression of zwf encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to the increase of NADPH, which is beneficial for l-threonine production. In E. coli, betaine can be taken through ProP encoded by proP or ProVWX encoded by proVWX. ProP is a H+-osmolyte symporter, whereas ProVWX is an ABC transporter. ProP and ProVWX mediate osmotic stress protection by transporting zwitterionic osmolytes, including glycine betaine. Betaine can also be synthesized in E. coli by enzymes encoded by betABIT. However, the influence of ProP, ProVWX and betABIT on l-threonine production in E. coli has not been investigated. Results In this study, the influence of ProP, ProVWX and betABIT on l-threonine production in E. coli has been investigated. Addition of betaine slightly improved the growth of the l-threonine producing E. coli strain TWF001 as well as the l-threonine production. Deletion of betABIT retarded the growth of TWF001 and slightly decreased the l-threonine production. However, deletion of proP or/and proVWX significantly increased the l-threonine production. When proP was deleted, the l-threonine production increased 33.3%; when proVWX was deleted, the l-threonine production increased 40.0%. When both proP and proVWX were deleted, the resulting strain TSW003 produced 23.5 g/l l-threonine after 36 h flask cultivation. The genes betABIT, proC, fadR, crr and ptsG were individually deleted from TSW003, and it was found that further absence of either crr (TWS008) or ptsG (TWS009) improved l-threonine production. TSW008 produced 24.9 g/l l-threonine after 36 h flask cultivation with a yield of 0.62 g/g glucose and a productivity of 0.69 g/l/h. TSW009 produced 26 g/l l-threonine after 48 h flask cultivation with a yield of 0.65 g/g glucose and a productivity of 0.54 g/l/h, which is 116% increase compared to the control TWF001. Conclusions In this study, l-threonine-producing E. coli strains TSW008 and TSW009 with high l-threonine productivity were developed by regulating the intracellular osmotic pressure. This strategy could be used to improve the production of other products in microorganisms.
33498488/Synthesis and Structure of Nido-Carboranyl Azide and Its "Click" Reactions Novel zwitter-ionic nido-carboranyl azide 9-N3(CH2)3Me2N-nido-7,8-C2B9H11 was prepared by the reaction of 9-Cl(CH2)3Me2N-nido-7,8-C2B9H11 with NaN3. The solid-state molecular structure of nido-carboranyl azide was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 9-N3(CH2)3Me2N-nido-7,8-C2B9H11 was used for the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition with phenylacetylene, alkynyl-3beta-cholesterol and cobalt/iron bis(dicarbollide) terminal alkynes to form the target 1,2,3-triazoles. The nido-carborane-cholesterol conjugate 9-3beta-Chol-O(CH2)C-CH-N3(CH2)3Me2N-nido-7,8-C2B9H11 with charge-compensated group in a linker can be used as a precursor for preparation of liposomes for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). A series of novel zwitter-ionic boron-enriched cluster compounds bearing a 1,2,3-triazol-metallacarborane-carborane conjugated system was synthesized. Prepared conjugates contain a large amount of boron atom in the biomolecule and potentially can be used for BNCT.
33658026/Effects of mineral complex material treatment on 2,4- dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis like-skin lesions in mice model Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic allergic inflammatory skin disease characterized by complex pathogenesis including skin barrier dysfunction, immune-redox disturbances, and pruritus. Prolonged topical treatment with medications such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and T-cell inhibitors may have some potential side-effects. To this end, many researchers have explored numerous alternative therapies using natural products and mineral compounds with antioxidant or immunomodulatory effects to minimize toxicity and adverse-effects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of mineral complex material (MCM) treatment on 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD-like skin lesions in SKH-1 hairless mice. Methods Animals were divided into four groups; normal control (NC), negative control treated with DNCB only (DNCB only), positive control treated with DNCB and tacrolimus ointment (PC) and experimental group treated with DNCB and MCM patch (MCM). Skin inflammation and lesion severity were investigated through analyses of skin parameters (barrier score and strength, moisture and trans-epidermal water loss level), histopathology, immunoglobulin E, and cytokines. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) levels were measured in both serum and skin lysate. Results Our results demonstrates that MCM patch improved the progression of AD-like skin lesions by significantly increasing skin barrier strength and decreasing trans-epidermal water loss. Additionally, dermal administration of MCM patch significantly reduced epidermal thickness, ROS, and NO levels in skin lysate. Furthermore, we found that MCM suppressed the levels of AD-involved (Th1 and Th2) cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 in blood. In addition, the levels of other Th1, and Th2 and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12(p70) and IL-10 were found lowest in the MCM group than in the DNCB only and PC groups. Moreover, we found total serum IgE level significantly increased after DNCB treatment, but decreased in the PC and MCM groups. Conclusion Taken together, our findings suggest that MCM application may have beneficial effects either systemic or regional on DNCB-induced AD lesional skin via regulation of the skin barrier function and immune-redox response.

33662039/Radon-220 diffusion from 224Ra-labeled calcium carbonate microparticles: Some implications for radiotherapeutic use Alpha-particle emitting radionuclides continue to be the subject of medical research because of their high energy and short range of action that facilitate effective cancer therapies. Radium-224 (224Ra) is one such candidate that has been considered for use in combating micrometastatic disease. In our prior studies, a suspension of 224Ra-labeled calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles was designed as a local therapy for disseminated cancers in the peritoneal cavity. The progenies of 224Ra, of which radon-220 (220Rn) is the first, together contribute three of the four alpha particles in the decay chain. The proximity of the progenies to the delivery site at the time of decay of the 224Ra-CaCO3 microparticles can impact its therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we show that the diffusion of 220Rn was reduced in labeled CaCO3 suspensions as compared with cationic 224Ra solutions, both in air and liquid volumes. Furthermore, free-floating lead-212 (212Pb), which is generated from released 220Rn, had the potential to be re-adsorbed onto CaCO3 microparticles. Under conditions mimicking an in vivo environment, more than 70% of the 212Pb was adsorbed onto the CaCO3 at microparticle concentrations above 1 mg/mL. Further, the diffusion of 220Rn seemed to occur whether the microparticles were labeled by the surface adsorption of 224Ra or if the 224Ra was incorporated into the bulk of the microparticles. The therapeutic benefit of differently labeled 224Ra-CaCO3 microparticles after intraperitoneal administration was similar when examined in mice bearing intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenografts. In conclusion, both the release of 220Rn and re-adsorption of 212Pb are features that have implications for the radiotherapeutic use of 224Ra-labeled CaCO3 microparticles. The release of 220Rn through diffusion may extend the effective range of alpha-particle dose deposition, and the re-adsorption of the longer lived 212Pb onto the CaCO3 microparticles may enhance the retention of this nuclide in the peritoneal cavity.
33667254/Effects of GABA/beta-glucan supplements on melatonin and serotonin content extracted from natural resources Objective This study aimed to monitor the secretion of serotonin and melatonin in the blood serum of rats in the presence of rice bran (RB), and Sarcodon aspratus (S) extracts for sleep promotion. Background Sleep is a natural physiological phenomenon, and sleep disorders may cause severe mental hazards leading to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and beta-glucan are the essential active ingredients of RB and mushroom, respectively, exhibited stress-reduction and nerve stabilizing potential through regulation of melatonin and serotonin hormones. Methods Cytotoxicity of the extracts (RBS) was evaluated through WST-1 assay. The melatonin and serotonin concentrations in the blood serum were measured through ELISA kits. The Ig ELISA kit measured the immunoglobulin's (IgG, IgM, and IgA) concentrations. Results Improved cell viability was observed in RBS treated groups than control, indicating their biocompatibility. The melatonin and serotonin levels were high in RBS (5:5 and 7:3) treated groups compared to the control. Enhanced expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G level was observed in RBS treated rats. The serotonergic genes (5-HTT, 5-HT 1B, and MAO-A) expression levels were upregulated in RBS treated groups vis-a-vis the control. Conclusion Based on these results, we anticipated that RBS supplements could promote the sleep phenomenon by elevating the serotonin/melatonin level in the blood through the serotonergic system. Therefore, RBS supplements can be utilized as functional food material for sleep promotion.
33050144/Role of Glutathione in Cancer: From Mechanisms to Therapies Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant non-protein thiol present at millimolar concentrations in mammalian tissues. As an important intracellular antioxidant, it acts as a regulator of cellular redox state protecting cells from damage caused by lipid peroxides, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and xenobiotics. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of GSH in key signal transduction reactions as a controller of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, ferroptosis and immune function. Molecular changes in the GSH antioxidant system and disturbances in GSH homeostasis have been implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and treatment response. Hence, GSH has both protective and pathogenic roles. Although in healthy cells it is crucial for the removal and detoxification of carcinogens, elevated GSH levels in tumor cells are associated with tumor progression and increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Recently, several novel therapies have been developed to target the GSH antioxidant system in tumors as a means for increased response and decreased drug resistance. In this comprehensive review we explore mechanisms of GSH functionalities and different therapeutic approaches that either target GSH directly, indirectly or use GSH-based prodrugs. Consideration is also given to the computational methods used to describe GSH related processes for in silico testing of treatment effects.
33036284/Detection and Characterization of Antibacterial Siderophores Secreted by Endophytic Fungi from Cymbidium aloifolium Endophytic fungi from orchid plants are reported to secrete secondary metabolites which include bioactive antimicrobial siderophores. In this study endophytic fungi capable of secreting siderophores were isolated from Cymbidium aloifolium, a medicinal orchid plant. The isolated extracellular siderophores from orchidaceous fungi act as chelating agents forming soluble complexes with Fe3+. The 60% endophytic fungi of Cymbidium aloifolium produced hydroxamate siderophore on CAS agar. The highest siderophore percentage was 57% in Penicillium chrysogenum (CAL1), 49% in Aspergillus sydowii (CAR12), 46% in Aspergillus terreus (CAR14) by CAS liquid assay. The optimum culture parameters for siderophore production were 30  C, pH 6.5, maltose and ammonium nitrate and the highest resulting siderophore content was 73% in P. chrysogenum. The total protein content of solvent-purified siderophore increased four-fold compared with crude filtrate. The percent Fe3+ scavenged was detected by atomic absorption spectra analysis and the highest scavenging value was 83% by P. chrysogenum. Thin layer chromatography of purified P. chrysogenum siderophore showed a wine-colored spot with Rf value of 0.54. HPLC peaks with Rts of 10.5 and 12.5 min were obtained for iron-free and iron-bound P. chrysogenum siderophore, respectively. The iron-free P. chrysogenum siderophore revealed an exact mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 400.46 and iron-bound P. chrysogenum siderophore revealed a m/z of 453.35. The solvent-extracted siderophores inhibited the virulent plant pathogens Ralstonia solanacearum, that causes bacterial wilt in groundnut and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae which causes bacterial blight disease in rice. Thus, bioactive siderophore-producing endophytic P. chrysogenum can be exploited in the form of formulations for development of resistance against other phytopathogens in crop plants.
33050104/Identification of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Synthesis Pathways in the Toxic Dinophyte Alexandrium minutum Using 13C-Labelling The synthetic pathways responsible for the production of the polyunsaturated fatty acids 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3 were studied in the Dinophyte Alexandrium minutum. The purpose of this work was to follow the progressive incorporation of an isotopic label (13CO2) into 11 fatty acids to better understand the fatty acid synthesis pathways in A. minutum. The Dinophyte growth was monitored for 54 h using high-frequency sampling. A. minutum presented a growth in two phases. A lag phase was observed during the first 30 h of development and had been associated with the probable temporary encystment of Dinophyte cells. An exponential growth phase was then observed after t30. A. minutum rapidly incorporated 13C into 22:6n-3, which ended up being the most 13C-enriched polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in this experiment, with a higher 13C atomic enrichment than 18:4n-3, 18:5n-3, 20:5n-3, and 22:5n-3. Overall, the 13C atomic enrichment (AE) was inversely proportional to number of carbons in n-3 PUFA. C18 PUFAs, 18:4n-3, and 18:5n-3, were indeed among the least 13C-enriched FAs during this experiment. They were assumed to be produced by the n-3 PUFA pathway. However, they could not be further elongated or desaturated to produce n-3 C20-C22 PUFA, because the AEs of the n-3 C18 PUFAs were lower than those of the n-3 C20-C22 PUFAs. Thus, the especially high atomic enrichment of 22:6n-3 (55.8% and 54.9% in neutral lipids (NLs) and polar lipids (PLs), respectively) led us to hypothesize that this major PUFA was synthesized by an O2-independent Polyketide Synthase (PKS) pathway. Another parallel PKS, independent of the one leading to 22:6n-3, was also supposed to produce 20:5n-3. The inverse order of the 13C atomic enrichment for n-3 PUFAs was also suspected to be related to the possible beta-oxidation of long-chain n-3 PUFAs occurring during A. minutum encystment.
32998255/A Diamine-PEGylated Oleanolic Acid Derivative Induced Efficient Apoptosis through a Death Receptor and Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway in HepG2 Human Hepatoma Cells Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. Our recent studies have shown that the diamine-(PEG)ylated oleanolic acid (OADP) has strong anti-tumor effects in HCCs. In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor mechanisms of OADP in the HepG2 HCC cell line. The cytotoxicity results showed that HepG2 cell viability was markedly reduced, with a very low 50% of cell growth inhibitory concentration (IC50, 0.14 microg/mL). We then investigated the anti-tumor mechanisms of OADP in HepG2 cells. The flow-cytometry analysis was used to evaluate cell apoptosis, indicating that 74-95% of cells were apoptotic. OADP caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression levels of key proteins associated with the underlying molecular mechanism. The results showed the clear upregulation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, Bak, p21, and p53, accompanied by the downregulation of Bcl-2. Similar results were obtained by the cotreatment with OADP and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. Agents such as OADP, which are capable of activating extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, may represent potential HCC cancer therapies.
33050050/Photodynamic Activation of Cholecystokinin 1 Receptor with Different Genetically Encoded Protein Photosensitizers and from Varied Subcellular Sites Cholecystokinin 1 receptor (CCK1R) is activated by singlet oxygen (1O2) generated in photodynamic action with sulphonated aluminum phthalocyanine (SALPC) or genetically encoded protein photosensitizer (GEPP) KillerRed or mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG). A large number of GEPP with varied 1O2 quantum yields have appeared recently; therefore, in the present work, the efficacy of different GEPP to photodynamically activate CCK1R was examined, as monitored by Fura-2 calcium imaging. KillerRed, miniSOG, miniSOG2, singlet oxygen protein photosensitizer (SOPP), flavin-binding fluorescent protein from Methylobacterium radiotolerans with point mutation C71G (Mr4511C71G), and flavin-binding fluorescent protein from Dinoroseobacter shibae (DsFbFP) were expressed at the plasma membrane (PM) in AR4-2J cells, which express endogenous CCK1R. Light irradiation (KillerRed: white light 85.3 mW cm-2, 4' and all others: LED 450 nm, 85 mW cm-2, 1.5') of GEPPPM-expressing AR4-2J was found to all trigger persistent calcium oscillations, a hallmark of permanent photodynamic CCK1R activation; DsFbFP was the least effective, due to poor expression. miniSOG was targeted to PM, mitochondria (MT) or lysosomes (LS) in AR4-2J in parallel experiments; LED light irradiation was found to all induce persistent calcium oscillations. In miniSOGPM-AR4-2J cells, light emitting diode (LED) light irradiation-induced calcium oscillations were readily inhibited by CCK1R antagonist devazepide 2 nM; miniSOGMT-AR4-2J cells were less susceptible, but miniSOGLS-AR4-2J cells were not inhibited. In conclusion, different GEPPPM could all photodynamically activate CCK1R. Intracellular GEPP photodynamic action may prove particularly suited to study intracellular GPCR. 
33066432/GluN2 Subunit-Dependent Redox Modulation of NMDA Receptor Activation by Homocysteine Homocysteine (HCY) molecule combines distinct pharmacological properties as an agonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a reducing agent. Whereas NMDAR activation by HCY was elucidated, whether the redox modulation contributes to its action is unclear. Here, using patch-clamp recording and imaging of intracellular Ca2+, we study dithiothreitol (DTT) effects on currents and Ca2+ responses activated by HCY through native NMDARs and recombinant diheteromeric GluN1/2A, GluN1/2B, and GluN1/2C receptors. Within a wide range (1-800 muM) of [HCY]s, the concentration-activation relationships for recombinant NMDARs revealed a biphasicness. The high-affinity component obtained between 1 and 100 microM [HCY]s corresponding to the NMDAR activation was not affected by 1 mM DTT. The low-affinity phase observed at [HCY]s above 200 muM probably originated from thiol-dependent redox modulation of NMDARs. The reduction of NMDAR disulfide bonds by either 1 mM DTT or 1 mM HCY decreased GluN1/2A currents activated by HCY. In contrast, HCY-elicited GluN1/2B currents were enhanced due to the remarkable weakening of GluN1/2B desensitization. In fact, cleaving NMDAR disulfide bonds in neurons reversed the HCY-induced Ca2+ accumulation, making it dependent on GluN2B- rather than GluN2A-containing NMDARs. Thus, estimated concentrations for the HCY redox effects exceed those in the plasma during intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia but may occur during severe hyperhomocysteinemia.
33066380/Erinacine C Activates Transcription from a Consensus ETS DNA Binding Site in Astrocytic Cells in Addition to NGF Induction Medicinal mushrooms of the genus Hericium are known to produce secondary metabolites with homeostatic properties for the central nervous system. We and others have recently demonstrated that among these metabolites cyathane diterpenoids and in particular erinacine C possess potent neurotrophin inducing properties in astrocytic cells. Yet, the signaling events downstream of erinacine C induced neurotrophin acitivity in neural-like adrenal phaeochromocytoma cells (PC12) cells have remained elusive. Similar, signaling events activated by erinacine C in astrocytic cells are unknown. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological inhibitors we show that erinacine C induced neurotrophic activity mediates PC12 cell differentiation via the TrkA receptor and likely its associated PLCgamma-, PI3K-, and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, a small library of transcriptional activation reporters revealed that erinacine C induces transcriptional activation mediated by DNA consensus binding sites of selected conserved transcription factor families. Among these, transcription is activated from an ETS consensus in a concentration dependent manner. Interestingly, induced ETS-consensus transcription occurs in parallel and independent of neurotrophin induction. This finding helps to explain the many pleiotropic functions of cyathane diterpenoids. Moreover, our studies provide genetic access to cyathane diterpenoid functions in astrocytic cells and help to mechanistically understand the action of cyathanes in glial cells.
33076219/Preventive Effect of Muscone against Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity in LLC-PK1 Cells Cisplatin, one of the most common antitumor agents, is widely applied to treat various cancerous diseases and is included in the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines. Cisplatin therapy is used to treat 10-20% of all cancerous cases, and its cure rate is especially high in testicular cancer (over 90%). However, a major side effect of this anticancer drug is nephrotoxicity, limiting treatment effect and reducing the quality of life in cancer patients. Muscone, an odoriferous constituent of musk, was confirmed to inhibit cisplatin-induced LLC-PK1 kidney proximal tubule cell death in a dose-dependent manner. In term of renal protective mechanism, muscone inhibited cisplatin oxidative toxicity by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and stimulating HO-1 expression. Muscone also exerted anti-inflammation effect through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, muscone mitigated cisplatin-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by inhibiting pro-apoptotic protein Bax expression, and cleaved caspase-3, 7, and 8; and increase of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 level. In addition, the anti-apoptotic effect of muscone also was enhanced by preventing p53 expression and its phosphorylation. Our study showed that muscone may be a potential protective agent against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
33131487/beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa from Qatar Background The distribution of beta-lactam resistance genes in P. aeruginosa is often closely related to the distribution of certain high-risk international clones. We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the predominant sequence types (ST) and beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-P. aeruginosa from Qatar Methods Microbiological identification and susceptibility tests were performed by automated BD Phoenix  system and manual Liofilchem MIC Test Strips. Results Among 75 MDR-P. aeruginosa isolates; the largest proportions of susceptibility were to ceftazidime-avibactam (n = 36, 48%), followed by ceftolozane-tazobactam (30, 40%), ceftazidime (n = 21, 28%) and aztreonam (n = 16, 21.3%). All isolates possessed Class C and/or Class D beta-lactamases (n = 72, 96% each), while metallo-beta-lactamases were detected in 20 (26.7%) isolates. Eight (40%) metallo-beta-lactamase producers were susceptible to aztreonam and did not produce any concomitant extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. High risk ST235 (n = 16, 21.3%), ST357 (n = 8, 10.7%), ST389 and ST1284 (6, 8% each) were most frequent. Nearly all ST235 isolates (15/16; 93.8%) were resistant to all tested beta-lactams. Conclusion MDR-P. aeruginosa isolates from Qatar are highly resistant to antipseudomonal beta-lactams. High-risk STs are predominant in Qatar and their associated MDR phenotypes are a cause for considerable concern.
33129262/Neurologic effects of short-term treatment with a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor after cardiac arrest in pediatric swine Background Cardiac arrest (CA) is the most common cause of acute neurologic insult in children. Many survivors have significant neurocognitive deficits at 1 year of recovery. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are multifunctional endogenous lipid signaling molecules that are involved in brain pathobiology and may be therapeutically relevant. However, EETs are rapidly metabolized to less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), limiting their bioavailability. We hypothesized that sEH inhibition would improve outcomes after CA in an infant swine model. Male piglets (3-4 kg, 2 weeks old) underwent hypoxic-asphyxic CA. After resuscitation, they were randomized to intravenous treatment with an sEH inhibitor (TPPU, 1 mg/kg; n = 8) or vehicle (10% poly(ethylene glycol); n = 9) administered at 30 min and 24 h after return of spontaneous circulation. Two sham-operated groups received either TPPU (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 8). Neurons were counted in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections from putamen and motor cortex in 4-day survivors. Results Piglets in the CA + vehicle groups had fewer neurons than sham animals in both putamen and motor cortex. However, the number of neurons after CA did not differ between vehicle- and TPPU-treated groups in either anatomic area. Further, 20% of putamen neurons in the Sham + TPPU group had abnormal morphology, with cell body attrition and nuclear condensation. TPPU treatment also did not reduce neurologic deficits. Conclusion Treatment with an sEH inhibitor at 30 min and 24 h after resuscitation from asphyxic CA does not protect neurons or improve acute neurologic outcomes in piglets.
33129273/Short chain fatty acids induced the type 1 and type 2 fimbrillin-dependent and fimbrillin-independent initial attachment and colonization of Actinomyces oris monoculture but not coculture with streptococci Background Actinomyces oris is an early colonizer and has two types of fimbriae on its cell surface, type 1 fimbriae (FimP and FimQ) and type 2 fimbriae (FimA and FimB), which contribute to the attachment and coaggregation with other bacteria and the formation of biofilm on the tooth surface, respectively. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolic products of oral bacteria including A. oris and regulate pH in dental plaques. To clarify the relationship between SCFAs and fimbrillins, effects of SCFAs on the initial attachment and colonization (INAC) assay using A. oris wild type and fimbriae mutants was investigated. INAC assays using A. oris MG1 strain cells were performed with SCFAs (acetic, butyric, propionic, valeric and lactic acids) or a mixture of them on human saliva-coated 6-well plates incubated in TSB with 0.25% sucrose for 1 h. The INAC was assessed by staining live and dead cells that were visualized with a confocal microscope. Results Among the SCFAs, acetic, butyric and propionic acids and a mixture of acetic, butyric and propionic acids induced the type 1 and type 2 fimbriae-dependent and independent INAC by live A. oris, but these cells did not interact with streptococci. The main effects might be dependent on the levels of the non-ionized acid forms of the SCFAs in acidic stress conditions. GroEL was also found to be a contributor to the FimA-independent INAC by live A. oris cells stimulated with non-ionized acid. Conclusion SCFAs affect the INAC-associated activities of the A. oris fimbrillins and non-fimbrillins during ionized and non-ionized acid formations in the form of co-culturing with other bacteria in the dental plaque but not impact the interaction of A. oris with streptococci.
33139720/Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer The FDA-approved anti-androgen Enzalutamide (Enz) has been used successfully as the last line therapy to extend castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients' survival by an extra 4.8 months. However, CRPC patients eventually develop Enz-resistance that may involve the induction of the androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant ARv7. Here we found that Cisplatin (Cis) or Carboplatin, currently used in chemotherapy/radiation therapy to suppress tumor progression, could restore the Enz sensitivity in multiple Enz-resistant (EnzR) CRPC cells via directly degrading/suppressing the ARv7. Combining Cis or Carboplatin with Enz therapy can also delay the development of Enz-resistance in CRPC C4-2 cells. Mechanism dissection found that Cis or Carboplatin might decrease the ARv7 expression via multiple mechanisms including targeting the lncRNA-Malat1/SF2 RNA splicing complex and increasing ARv7 degradation via altering ubiquitination. Preclinical studies using in vivo mouse model with implanted EnzR1-C4-2 cells also demonstrated that Cis plus Enz therapy resulted in better suppression of EnzR CRPC progression than Enz treatment alone. These results not only unveil the previously unrecognized Cis mechanism to degrade ARv7 via targeting the Malat1/SF2 complex and ubiquitination signals, it may also provide a novel and ready therapy to further suppress the EnzR CRPC progression in the near future.
33139695/Copanlisib promotes growth inhibition and apoptosis by modulating the AKT/FoxO3a/PUMA axis in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the type of cancer with the third highest incidence and is associated with high mortality and low 5-year survival rates. We observed that copanlisib, an inhibitor of PI3K (pan-class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that preferentially inhibits PI3Kdelta and PI3Kalpha, impedes the growth of CRC cells by inducing apoptosis via PUMA. There was a marked increase in the expression of PUMA independent of p53 after treatment with copanlisib. The response of CRC cells to copanlisib could be predicted by PUMA expression. Copanlisib was found to induce PUMA expression through FoxO3a by directly binding to the PUMA promoter after inhibiting AKT signaling. PUMA deficiency mitigated the apoptosis induced by copanlisib. Caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction led to copanlisib resistance, as observed through a clonogenic assay, whereas enhanced expression of PUMA increased the copanlisib-induced susceptibility to apoptosis. Moreover, the antitumor effects of copanlisib were suppressed by a deficiency of PUMA in a xenograft model, and caspase activation and reduced apoptosis were also observed in vivo. Copanlisib-mediated chemosensitization seemed to involve the concurrent induction of PUMA expression via mechanisms that were both dependent and independent of p53. These observations indicate that apoptosis mediated by PUMA is crucial for the anticancer effects of copanlisib and that manipulation of PUMA may aid in enhancing anticancer activities.
33143648/Usefulness of sialic acid for diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients: a retrospective study Background Early diagnosis of sepsis is very important. It is necessary to find effective and adequate biomarkers in order to diagnose sepsis. In this study, we compared the value of sialic acid and procalcitonin for diagnosing sepsis. Methods Newly admitted intensive care unit patients were enrolled from January 2019 to June 2019. We retrospectively collected patient data, including presence of sepsis or not, procalcitonin level and sialic acid level. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the ability of sialic acid, procalcitonin and combination of sialic acid and procalcitonin to diagnose sepsis were carried out. Results A total of 644 patients were admitted to our department from January 2019 to June 2019. The incomplete data were found in 147 patients. Finally, 497 patients data were analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve for the diagnosis of sepsis with sialic acid, procalcitonin and combination of sialic acid and procalcitonin were 64.2, 78.3%, 0.763; 67.9, 84.0%, 0.816 and 75.2, 84.6%, 0.854. Moreover, sialic acid had good values for diagnosing septic patients with viral infection, with 87.5% sensitivity, 82.2% specificity, and 0.882 the area under the curve. Conclusions Compared to procalcitonin, sialic acid had a lower diagnostic efficacy for diagnosing sepsis in critically ill patients. However, the combination of sialic acid and procalcitonin had a higher diagnostic efficacy for sepsis. Moreover, sialic acid had good value for diagnosing virus-induced sepsis.
33148329/Fluoroquinolone resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from healthy conjunctiva and analysis of their mutations in quinolone-resistance determining region Background Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common pathogen in postoperative endophthalmitis and causes various infectious eye diseases. However, there is very little information on fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance to S. epidermidis identified in conjunctival microbe and analysis of related genes. Here, the authors investigated the rate of resistance to fluoroquinolones of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from normal conjunctival microbes and mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR).  Methods 377 eye samples from 187 patients who underwent intravitreal injection and cataract surgery were included. Specimens were taken from the bilateral lower conjunctival sacs using a cotton swab and cultured. The cultures were identified using MALDI-TOP MS and gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE gene mutations of QRDR were confirmed by DNA extraction from resistant strains of S. epidermidis with a micro-dilution method using ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Results The culture positive rate was 61.8% (231) for 374 eye samples. Of the 303 total strains cultured, S. epidermidis was the most common with 33.7% (102). Ten types of gene mutations were observed in the resistant S. epidermidis of 21 strains. One-point mutation was observed mainly in gyrA and parC, and a small number of mutations were observed in parE in the form of a double point mutations. When there were multiple point mutations in both gyrA and parC, the highest minimum inhibitory concentration was observed. Conclusions The quinolone resistance rate of S. epidermidis increased in comparison with previous studies, and resistant S. epidermidis showed mostly QRDR mutations, which were mainly found in gyrA and parC, and showed strong resistance when mutated in both genes.
33143710/Differential effects of antibiotics on neutrophils exposed to lipoteichoic acid derived from Staphylococcus aureus Background Persistent bacteremia occurs in at least 30% of patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) and may be attributable to a dysregulated host immune response. Neutrophils interact with a variety of S. aureus microbial factors, including lipoteichoic acid (LTA), to activate phagocytic function in a concentration-dependent manner. Antibiotics have been shown to exert both direct antimicrobial action as well as immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we compared the effects of different anti-staphylococcal antibiotics on LTA-mediated immune activation of neutrophils. Methods Neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteers were exposed to two levels of LTA (1 and 10 mug/ml) with or without addition of antibiotics from different pharmacologic classes (vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline). Neutrophil function was assessed by examining phagocytic response, activation (CD11b, CD62L expression), Toll-like receptor-2 expression, cell survival and apoptosis, and CXCL8 release. Results Differential LTA-mediated antibiotic effects on neutrophil function were observed primarily at the high LTA exposure level. Ceftaroline in the presence of 10 mug/ml LTA had the most prominent effects on phagocytosis and CD11b and CD62L expression, with trends towards increased neutrophil survival and preservation of CXCL8 release when compared to daptomycin and vancomycin with the latter significantly dampening PMN CXCL8 release. Conclusions Select antimicrobial agents, such as ceftaroline, exert immunostimulatory effects on neutrophils exposed to S. aureus LTA, which when confirmed in vivo, could be leveraged for its dual immunomodulatory and antibacterial actions for the treatment of persistent SAB mediated by a dysregulated host response.
33144562/Combined treatment of mitoxantrone sensitizes breast cancer cells to rapalogs through blocking eEF-2K-mediated activation of Akt and autophagy Oncogenic activation of the mTOR signaling pathway occurs frequently in tumor cells and contributes to the devastating features of cancer, including breast cancer. mTOR inhibitors rapalogs are promising anticancer agents in clinical trials; however, rapalogs resistance remains an unresolved clinical challenge. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which cells become resistant to rapalogs may guide the development of successful mTOR-targeted cancer therapy. In this study, we found that eEF-2K, which is overexpressed in cancer cells and is required for survival of stressed cells, was involved in the negative-feedback activation of Akt and cytoprotective autophagy induction in breast cancer cells in response to mTOR inhibitors. Therefore, disruption of eEF-2K simultaneously abrogates the two critical resistance signaling pathways, sensitizing breast cancer cells to rapalogs. Importantly, we identified mitoxantrone, an admitted anticancer drug for a wide range of tumors, as a potential inhibitor of eEF-2K via a structure-based virtual screening strategy. We further demonstrated that mitoxantrone binds to eEF-2K and inhibits its activity, and the combination treatment of mitoxantrone and mTOR inhibitor resulted in significant synergistic cytotoxicity in breast cancer. In conclusion, we report that eEF-2K contributes to the activation of resistance signaling pathways of mTOR inhibitor, suggesting a novel strategy to enhance mTOR-targeted cancer therapy through combining mitoxantrone, an eEF-2K inhibitor.
33144375/In Vivo Emergence of a Novel Protease Inhibitor Resistance Signature in HIV-1 Matrix Protease inhibitors (PIs) are the second- and last-line therapy for the majority of HIV-infected patients worldwide. Only around 20% of individuals who fail PI regimens develop major resistance mutations in protease. We sought to explore the role of mutations in gag-pro genotypic and phenotypic changes in viruses from six Nigerian patients who failed PI-based regimens without known drug resistance-associated protease mutations in order to identify novel determinants of PI resistance. ABSTRACT Protease inhibitors (PIs) are the second- and last-line therapy for the majority of HIV-infected patients worldwide. Only around 20% of individuals who fail PI regimens develop major resistance mutations in protease. We sought to explore the role of mutations in gag-pro genotypic and phenotypic changes in viruses from six Nigerian patients who failed PI-based regimens without known drug resistance-associated protease mutations in order to identify novel determinants of PI resistance. Target enrichment and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with the Illumina MiSeq system were followed by haplotype reconstruction. Full-length Gag-protease gene regions were amplified from baseline (pre-PI) and virologic failure (VF) samples, sequenced, and used to construct gag-pro-pseudotyped viruses. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum-likelihood methods. Susceptibility to lopinavir (LPV) and darunavir (DRV) was measured using a single-cycle replication assay. Western blotting was used to analyze Gag cleavage. In one of six participants (subtype CRF02_AG), we found 4-fold-lower LPV susceptibility in viral clones during failure of second-line treatment. A combination of four mutations (S126del, H127del, T122A, and G123E) in the p17 matrix of baseline virus generated a similar 4-fold decrease in susceptibility to LPV but not darunavir. These four amino acid changes were also able to confer LPV resistance to a subtype B Gag-protease backbone. Western blotting demonstrated significant Gag cleavage differences between sensitive and resistant isolates in the presence of drug. Resistant viruses had around 2-fold-lower infectivity than sensitive clones in the absence of drug. NGS combined with haplotype reconstruction revealed that resistant, less fit clones emerged from a minority population at baseline and thereafter persisted alongside sensitive fitter viruses. We used a multipronged genotypic and phenotypic approach to document emergence and temporal dynamics of a novel protease inhibitor resistance signature in HIV-1 matrix, revealing the interplay between Gag-associated resistance and fitness.
33144377/The Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Major Adhesin Hia Is a Dual-Function Lectin That Binds to Human-Specific Respiratory Tract Sialic Acid Glycan Receptors Host-adapted bacterial pathogens like NTHi have evolved specific mechanisms to colonize their restricted host niche. Relatively few of the adhesins expressed by NTHi have been characterized as regards their binding affinity at the molecular level. In this work, we show that the major NTHi adhesin Hia preferentially binds to Neu5Ac-alpha2-6-sialyllactosamine, the form of sialic acid expressed in humans. The receptors targeted by Hia in the human airway mirror those targeted by influenza A virus and indicates the broad importance of sialic acid glycans as receptors for microbes that colonize the human airway. ABSTRACT NTHi is a human-adapted pathogen that colonizes the human respiratory tract. Strains of NTHi express multiple adhesins; however, there is a unique, mutually exclusive relationship between the major adhesins Hia and HMW1 and HMW2 (HMW1/2). Approximately 25% of NTHi strains express Hia, a phase-variable autotransporter protein that has a critical role in colonization of the host nasopharynx. The remaining 75% of strains express HMW1/2. Previous work has shown that the HMW1 and HMW2 proteins mediate binding to 2-3- and 2-6-linked sialic acid glycans found in the human respiratory tract. Here, we show that the high-affinity binding domain of Hia, binding domain 1 (BD1), is responsible for binding to alpha2-6-sialyllactosamine (2-6 SLN) glycans. BD1 is highly specific for glycans that incorporate the form of sialic acid expressed by humans, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). We further show that Hia has lower-affinity binding activity for 2-3-linked sialic acid and that this binding activity is mediated via a distinct domain. Thus, Hia with its dual binding activities functionally mimics the combined activities of the HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins. In addition, we show that Hia has a role in biofilm formation by strains of NTHi that express the adhesin. Knowledge of the binding affinity of this major NTHi adhesin and putative vaccine candidate will direct and inform development of future vaccines and therapeutic strategies for this important pathogen.
33155133/Development and validation of a sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for the simultaneous determination of ten kinase inhibitors in human serum and plasma A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of ten kinase inhibitors (afatinib, axitinib, bosutinib, cabozantinib, dabrafenib, lenvatinib, nilotinib, osimertinib, ruxolitinib, and trametinib) in human serum and plasma for the application in daily clinical routine has been developed and validated according to the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency validation guidelines for bioanalytical methods. After protein precipitation of plasma samples with acetonitrile, chromatographic separation was performed at ambient temperature using a Waters XBridge  Phenyl 3.5 mum (2.1 x 50 mm) column. The mobile phases consisted of water-methanol (9:1, v/v) with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate as phase A and methanol-water (9:1, v/v) with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate as phase B. Gradient elution was applied at a flow rate of 400 muL/min. Analytes were detected and quantified using multiple reaction monitoring in electrospray ionization positive mode. Stable isotopically labeled compounds of each kinase inhibitor were used as internal standards. The acquisition time was 7.0 min per run. All analytes and internal standards eluted within 3.0 min. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 2-500 ng/mL for afatinib, axitinib, bosutinib, lenvatinib, ruxolitinib, and trametinib, and 6-1500 ng/mL for cabozantinib, dabrafenib, nilotinib, and osimertinib (coefficients of correlation >= 0.99). Validation assays for accuracy and precision, matrix effect, recovery, carryover, and stability were appropriate according to regulatory agencies. The rapid and sensitive assay ensures high throughput and was successfully applied to monitor concentrations of kinase inhibitors in patients.

33154352/GDC-0349 inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell growth Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related human mortality with a clear need for new therapeutic intervention. GDC-0349 is a potent and selective ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor. In A549 cells and primary human NSCLC cells, GDC-0349 inhibited cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion, while inducing significant apoptosis activation. Although GDC-0349 blocked Akt-mTORC1/2 activation in NSCLC cells, it also exerted cytotoxicity in Akt1-knockout A549 cells. Furthermore, restoring Akt-mTOR activation by a constitutively-active Akt1 only partially attenuated GDC-0349-induced A549 cell apoptosis, indicating the existence of Akt-mTOR-independent mechanisms. In NSCLC cells GDC-0349 induced sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) inhibition, ceramide accumulation, JNK activation and oxidative injury. Conversely, N-acetylcysteine, the JNK inhibitor and sphingosine 1-phosphate alleviated GDC-0349-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis. In vivo, daily oral administration of GDC-0349 potently inhibited NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. Akt-mTOR in-activation, SphK1 inhibition, JNK activation and oxidative stress were detected in NSCLC xenograft tissues with GDC-0349 administration. In summary, GDC-0349 inhibits NSCLC cell growth via Akt-mTOR-dependent and Akt-mTOR-independent mechanisms.
33158454/Forced exercise activates the NrF2 pathway in the striatum and ameliorates motor and behavioral manifestations of Parkinson's disease in rotenone-treated rats Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leading to dopamine depletion and problems of movement, emotions, and cognition. While the pathogenesis of PD is not clear, damage of dopaminergic neurons by oxygen-derived free radicals is considered an important contributing mechanism. This study aimed to evaluate the role of treadmill exercise in male Wister rats as a single treatment and as an aid-therapy with L-dopa for rotenone-induced PD. To study the role of the Nrf2- ARE pathway as a mechanism involved in exercise-associated improvement in rotenone-induced PD in rats. Method Animals were divided into 5 groups, (Control, rotenone, rotenone\exercise, rotenone\L-dopa, and rotenone\exercise\L-dopa (combination)groups). After the PD induction, rats in the rotenone\exercise and combination groups were daily treadmill exercised for 4 weeks. Results Treadmill exercise significantly improved behavioral and motor aspects of rotenone-induced PD. When treadmill exercise was introduced as a single intervention, it amended most behavioral aspects of PD, gait fully corrected, short-term memory, and motor coordination. Where L-dopa corrected locomotor activity and motor coordination but failed to improve short-term memory and only partially corrected the gait of rotenone-treated rats. When treadmill exercise was combined with L-dopa, all features of PD were corrected. It was found that exercise upregulated some of its associative genes to Nrf2 pathways such as TFAM, Nrf2 and NQO.1 mRNA expression. Conclusion This study suggests that forced exercise improved parkinsonian like features by activating the Nrf2 pathway.
33159047/SYK inhibition targets acute myeloid leukemia stem cells by blocking their oxidative metabolism Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is an important oncogene and signaling mediator activated by cell surface receptors crucial for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) maintenance and progression. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of SYK in AML cells leads to increased differentiation, reduced proliferation, and cellular apoptosis. Herein, we addressed the consequences of SYK inhibition to leukemia stem-cell (LSC) function and assessed SYK-associated pathways in AML cell biology. Using gain-of-function MEK kinase mutant and constitutively active STAT5A, we demonstrate that R406, the active metabolite of a small-molecule SYK inhibitor fostamatinib, induces differentiation and blocks clonogenic potential of AML cells through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway and STAT5A transcription factor, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition of SYK with R406 reduced LSC compartment defined as CD34+CD38-CD123+ and CD34+CD38-CD25+ in vitro, and decreased viability of LSCs identified by a low abundance of reactive oxygen species. Primary leukemic blasts treated ex vivo with R406 exhibited lower engraftment potential when xenotransplanted to immunodeficient NSG/J mice. Mechanistically, these effects are mediated by disturbed mitochondrial biogenesis and suppression of oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) in LSCs. These mechanisms appear to be partially dependent on inhibition of STAT5 and its target gene MYC, a well-defined inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, inhibition of SYK increases the sensitivity of LSCs to cytarabine (AraC), a standard of AML induction therapy. Taken together, our findings indicate that SYK fosters OXPHOS and participates in metabolic reprogramming of AML LSCs in a mechanism that at least partially involves STAT5, and that SYK inhibition targets LSCs in AML. Since active SYK is expressed in a majority of AML patients and confers inferior prognosis, the combination of SYK inhibitors with standard chemotherapeutics such as AraC constitutes a new therapeutic modality that should be evaluated in future clinical trials.
33159035/circ-CBFB upregulates p66Shc to perturb mitochondrial dynamics in APAP-induced liver injury p66Shc, a master regulator of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), is a crucial mediator of hepatocyte oxidative stress. However, its functional contribution to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury and the mechanism by which it is modulated remain unknown. Here, we aimed to assess the effect of p66Shc on APAP-induced liver injury and to evaluate if circular RNA (circRNA) functions as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to mediate p66Shc in APAP-induced liver injury. p66Shc-, miR-185-5p-, and circ-CBFB-silenced mice were injected with APAP. AML12 cells were transfected with p66Shc, miR-185-5p, and circ-CBFB silencing or overexpression plasmids or siRNAs prior to APAP stimulation. p66Shc was upregulated in liver tissues in response to APAP, and p66Shc silencing in vivo protected mice from APAP-induced mitochondrial dynamics perturbation and liver injury. p66Shc knockdown in vitro attenuated mitochondrial dynamics and APAP-induced hepatocyte injury. Mechanically, p66Shc perturbs mitochondrial dynamics partially by inhibiting OMA1 ubiquitination. miR-185-5p, which directly suppressed p66Shc translation, was identified by microarray and bioinformatics analyses, and its overexpression attenuated mitochondrial dynamics and hepatocyte injury in vitro. Furthermore, luciferase, pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that circ-CBFB acts as a miRNA sponge of miR-185-5p to mediate p66Shc in APAP-induced liver injury. circ-CBFB knockdown also alleviated APAP-induced mitochondrial dynamics perturbation and hepatocyte injury. More importantly, we found that the protective effects of circ-CBFB knockdown on p66Shc, mitochondrial dynamics and liver injury were abolished by miR-185-5p inhibition both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, p66Shc is a key regulator of APAP-induced liver injury that acts by triggering mitochondrial dynamics perturbation. circ-CBFB functions as a ceRNA to regulate p66Shc during APAP-induced liver injury, which may provide a potential therapeutic target.
33161415/Membrane nanotubes facilitate the propagation of inflammatory injury in the heart upon overactivation of the beta-adrenergic receptor Acute sympathetic stress quickly induces cardiac inflammation and injury, suggesting that pathogenic signals rapidly spread among cardiac cells and that cell-to-cell communication may play an important role in the subsequent cardiac injury. However, the underlying mechanism of this response is unknown. Our previous study demonstrated that acute beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) signaling activates inflammasomes in the heart, which triggers the inflammatory cascade. In the present study, beta-AR overactivation induced inflammasome activation in both the cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) of mice hearts following a subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO, 5 mg/kg body weight), a selective agonist of beta-AR. In isolated cardiac cells, ISO treatment only activated the inflammasomes in the cardiomyocytes but not the CFs. These results demonstrated that inflammasome activation was propagated from cardiomyocytes to CFs in the mice hearts. Further investigation revealed that the inflammasomes were activated in the cocultured CFs that connected with cardiomyocytes via membrane nanotubes (MNTs), a novel membrane structure that mediates distant intercellular connections and communication. Disruption of the MNTs with the microfilament polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D (Cyto D) attenuated the inflammasome activation in the cocultured CFs. In addition, the MNT-mediated inflammasome activation in the CFs was blocked by deficiency of the inflammasome component NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in the cardiomyocytes, but not NLRP3 deficiency in the CFs. Moreover, ISO induced pyroptosis in the CFs cocultured with cardiomyocytes, and this process was inhibited by disruption of the MNTs with Cyto D or by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK (FMK). Our study revealed that MNTs facilitate the rapid propagation of inflammasome activation among cardiac cells to promote pyroptosis in the early phase of beta-adrenergic insult. Therefore, preventing inflammasome transfer is a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate acute beta-AR overactivation-induced cardiac injury.
33167911/Effects of thiamine on vasopressor requirements in patients with septic shock: a prospective randomized controlled trial Background Thiamine, an essential vitamin for aerobic metabolism and glutathione cycling, may decrease the effects of critical illnesses. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous thiamine administration can reduce vasopressor requirements in patients with septic shock. Methods This study was a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. We included adult patients with septic shock who required a vasopressor within 1-24 h after admission between March 2018 and January 2019 at a tertiary hospital in Thailand. Patients were divided into two groups: those who received 200 mg thiamine or those receiving a placebo every 12 h for 7 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the number of vasopressor-free days over 7 days. The pre-defined sample size was 31 patients per group, and the study was terminated early due to difficult recruitment. Results Sixty-two patients were screened and 50 patients were finally enrolled in the study, 25 in each group. There was no difference in the primary outcome of vasopressor-free days within the 7-day period between the thiamine and placebo groups (mean: 4.9 days (1.9) vs. 4.0 days (2.7), p = 0.197, mean difference - 0.9, 95% CI (- 2.9 to 0.5)). However, the reductions in lactate (p = 0.024) and in the vasopressor dependency index (p = 0.02) at 24 h were greater among subjects who received thiamine repletion vs. the placebo. No statistically significant difference was observed in SOFA scores within 7 days, vasopressor dependency index within 4 days and 7 days, or 28-day mortality. Conclusions Thiamine was not associated to a significant reduction in vasopressor-free days over 7-days in comparison to placebo in patients with septic shock. Administration of thiamine could be associated with a reduction in vasopressor dependency index and lactate level within 24 h. The study is limited by early stopping and low sample size.

32998467/Membrane Interaction of Ibuprofen with Cholesterol-Containing Lipid Membranes Deciphering the membrane interaction of drug molecules is important for improving drug delivery, cellular uptake, and the understanding of side effects of a given drug molecule. For the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, several studies reported contradictory results regarding the impact of ibuprofen on cholesterol-containing lipid membranes. Here, we investigated membrane localization and orientation as well as the influence of ibuprofen on membrane properties in POPC/cholesterol bilayers using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical assays. The presence of ibuprofen disturbs the molecular order of phospholipids as shown by alterations of the 2H and 31P-NMR spectra of the lipids, but does not lead to an increased membrane permeability or changes of the phase state of the bilayer. 1H MAS NOESY NMR results demonstrate that ibuprofen adopts a mean position in the upper chain/glycerol region of the POPC membrane, oriented with its polar carbonyl group towards the aqueous phase. This membrane position is only marginally altered in the presence of cholesterol. A previously reported result that ibuprofen is expelled from the membrane interface in cholesterol-containing DMPC bilayers could not be confirmed.
32998374/Computational and In Vitro Investigation of (-)-Epicatechin and Proanthocyanidin B2 as Inhibitors of Human Matrix Metalloproteinase 1 Matrix metalloproteinases 1 (MMP-1) energetically triggers the enzymatic proteolysis of extracellular matrix collagenase (ECM), resulting in progressive skin aging. Natural flavonoids are well known for their antioxidant properties and have been evaluated for inhibition of matrix metalloproteins in human. Recently, (-)-epicatechin and proanthocyanidin B2 were reported as essential flavanols from various natural reservoirs as potential anti-inflammatory and free radical scavengers. However, their molecular interactions and inhibitory potential against MMP-1 are not yet well studied. In this study, sequential absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiling, quantum mechanics calculations, and molecular docking simulations by extra precision Glide protocol predicted the drug-likeness of (-)-epicatechin (-7.862 kcal/mol) and proanthocyanidin B2 (-8.145 kcal/mol) with the least reactivity and substantial binding affinity in the catalytic pocket of human MMP-1 by comparison to reference bioactive compound epigallocatechin gallate (-6.488 kcal/mol). These flavanols in docked complexes with MMP-1 were further studied by 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations that revealed substantial stability and intermolecular interactions, viz. hydrogen and ionic interactions, with essential residues, i.e., His218, Glu219, His222, and His228, in the active pocket of MMP-1. In addition, binding free energy calculations using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) method suggested the significant role of Coulomb interactions and van der Waals forces in the stability of respective docked MMP-1-flavonol complexes by comparison to MMP-1-epigallocatechin gallate; these observations were further supported by MMP-1 inhibition assay using zymography. Altogether with computational and MMP-1-zymography results, our findings support (-)-epicatechin as a comparatively strong inhibitor of human MMP-1 with considerable drug-likeness against proanthocyanidin B2 in reference to epigallocatechin gallate.
33050072/Lipid Profile, Lipoprotein Subfractions, and Fluidity of Membranes in Children and Adolescents with Depressive Disorder: Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Study Depressive disorder (DD) is a psychiatric disorder whose molecular basis is not fully understood. It is assumed that reduced consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids (FA) is associated with DD. Other lipids such as total cholesterol (TCH), LDL-, and HDL-cholesterols (LDL-CH, HDL-CH) also play a role in depression. The primary endpoint of the study was the effect of omega-3 FA on the severity of depression in children and adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the secondary endpoint, relationship between depressive disorder symptoms and lipid profile, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol subfractions, Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activities, and erythrocyte membrane fluidity in 58 depressed children and adolescents (calculated by the statistical program on the effect size), as well as the effect of omega-3 FA on the monitored parameters. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), lipid profile by standard biochemical procedures, and LDL- and HDL-subfractions by the Lipoprint system. Basic biochemical parameters including lipid profile were compared with levels in 20 healthy children and were in the physiological range. Improvement of symptoms in the group supplemented with a fish oil emulsion rich in omega-3 FA in contrast to omega-6 FA (emulsion of sunflower oil) has been observed. We are the first to report that omega-3 FAs, but not omega-6 FA, increase large HDL subfractions (anti-atherogenic) after 12 weeks of supplementation and decrease small HDL subfractions (proatherogenic) in depressed children. We found a negative correlation between CDI score and HDL-CH and the large HDL subfraction, but not LDL-CH subfractions. CDI score was not associated with erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Our results suggest that HDL-CH and its subfractions, but not LDL-CH may play a role in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder. The study was registered under ISRCTN81655012.
33053668/The Polar Lipidome of Cultured Emiliania huxleyi: A Source of Bioactive Lipids with Relevance for Biotechnological Applications Polar lipids from microalgae have aroused greater interest as a natural source of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), an alternative to fish, but also as bioactive compounds with multiple applications. The present study aims to characterize the polar lipid profile of cultured microalga Emiliania huxleyi using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) and fatty acids (FA) analysis by gas chromatography (GC-MS). The lipidome of E. huxleyi revealed the presence of distinct n-3 PUFA (40% of total FA), namely docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and stearidonic acid (18:4n-3), which give this microalga an increased commercial value as a source of n-3 PUFA present in the form of polar lipids. A total of 134 species of polar lipids were identified and some of these species, particularly glycolipids, have already been reported for their bioactive properties. Among betaine lipids, the diacylglyceryl carboxyhydroxymethylcholine (DGCC) class is the least reported in microalgae. For the first time, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine (MMPE) has been found in the lipidome of E. huxleyi. Overall, this study highlights the potential of E. huxleyi as a sustainable source of high-value polar lipids that can be exploited for different applications, namely human and animal nutrition, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.
32998376/Anti-Survival and Pro-Apoptotic Effects of 6-Shogaol on SW872 Human Liposarcoma Cells via Control of the Intrinsic Caspase Pathway, STAT-3, AMPK, and ER Stress Notably, 6-Shogaol, a bioactive natural substance, has anticancer effects on many types of tumors. Up to date, the anticancer effect and mode of action of 6-Shogaol on liposarcoma are not known. In this study, we investigated whether 6-Shogaol inhibits the growth of SW872 and 93T449 cells, two different human liposarcoma cell lines. Of note, 6-Shogaol inhibited the growth of SW872 and 93T449 cells without affecting that of normal 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Specifically, 6-Shogaol further induced the apoptosis of SW872 cells, as evidenced by nuclear DNA fragmentation, increased sub G1 population, activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway, and PARP cleavage. However, pretreatment with either z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, or N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, attenuated the 6-Shogaol's growth-suppressive and apoptosis-inducing effects on SW872 cells. Moreover, 6-Shogaol activated AMPK while inhibited STAT-3 in SW872 cells, and siRNA-based genetic silencing of AMPK or STAT-3 considerably blocked the growth-suppressive and apoptotic response of 6-Shogaol to SW872 cells. Moreover, 6-Shogaol also upregulated the expression and phosphorylation of GRP-78, eIF-2alpha, ATF4, and CHOP, known ER stress markers, in SW872 cells, illustrating the induction of ER stress. These findings collectively demonstrate that 6-Shogaol has strong antigrowth and proapoptotic effects on SW872 cells through regulation of the intrinsic caspase pathway, oxidative stress, STAT-3, AMPK, and ER stress.
32998456/Toolbox Accelerating Glycomics (TAG): Glycan Annotation from MALDI-TOF MS Spectra and Mapping Expression Variation to Biosynthetic Pathways Glycans present extraordinary structural diversity commensurate with their involvement in numerous fundamental cellular processes including growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Unlike linear DNA and protein sequences, glycans have heterogeneous structures that differ in composition, branching, linkage, and anomericity. These differences pose a challenge to developing useful software for glycomic analysis. To overcome this problem, we developed the novel Toolbox Accelerating Glycomics (TAG) program. TAG consists of three units: 'TAG List' creates a glycan list that is used for database searching in TAG Expression; 'TAG Expression' automatically annotates and quantifies glycan signals and draws graphs; and 'TAG Pathway' maps the obtained expression information to biosynthetic pathways. Herein, we discuss the concepts, outline the TAG process, and demonstrate its potential using glycomic expression profile data from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and mutants lacking a functional Npc1 gene (Npc1 knockout (KO) CHO cells). TAG not only drastically reduced the amount of time and labor needed for glycomic analysis but also detected and quantified more glycans than manual analysis. Although this study was limited to the analysis of N-glycans and free oligosaccharides, the glycomic platform will be expanded to facilitate the analysis of O-glycans and glycans of glycosphingolipids.
33168093/Artemether-lumefantrin treatment adherence among uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria patients, visiting public health facilities in AsgedeTsimbla district, Tigray, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study Background Ethiopia has set a goal to eliminate malaria by 2030; Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is put as one of the cornerstone strategies for uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria treatment. However, only focusing on prescribing of the treatment without assessing patients' adherence could lead to the resistance of the drug. In Ethiopia, there is limited evidence about patients' adherence to AL and its influencing factors. Therefore, this study aimed at addressing this information gap. Methods A health facility based cross-sectional study was employed. Participants were selected using simple random sampling technique from registration books of the public health facilities in AsgedeTsimbla. Data were collected from March 24th to April 30th, 2018. We interviewed participants using a pre-tested structured questionnaire, and the blister pack was also inspected at their homes on day 4. Data were entered into Epi-Info and analyzed using SPSS 21. Odds ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals were estimated and the level of significance was declared at p-value <= 0.05. Results A total of 384 study participants were interviewed with a response rate of 95.5%. The overall AL adherence was 53.6% (95% CI 48.4-58.3%). Children aged < 5 years [AOR: 0.4, 95% CI (0.2-0.8)], and being treated in health post [AOR: 0.3, 95% CI (0.1-0.5)] were more likely to show AL adherence whereas illiteracy [AOR: 9.4, 95% CI (4.2-21.3)], didn't know the consequence of discontinued AL [AOR: 4.0, 95% CI (2.1-7.6)], had concomitant drugs [AOR: 2.5, 95% CI (1.4-4.5)], and stopped/saved drug when improved before tablet got finished [AOR: 3.2, 95% CI (1.7-5.9)] were factors less likely to be associated with AL adherence. Conclusion AL adherence was low. Children aged < 5 years, and being treated in health post were determinants of AL adherence whereas illiteracy, didn't know the consequence of discontinued the drug, had concomitant drugs, and stopped/saved drug when improved before tablet got finished were factors that hindered the AL adherence. Stakeholders should emphasize designing appropriate strategies including educational interventions to increase the AL adherence and prevent drug resistance. Further research should be conducted to evaluate AL resistance.
33168102/The carbapenem resistance gene blaOXA-23 is disseminated by a conjugative plasmid containing the novel transposon Tn6681 in Acinetobacter johnsonii M19 Background Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter species have caused great difficulties in clinical therapy in the worldwide. Here we describe an Acinetobacter johnsonii M19 with a novel blaOXA-23 containing transposon Tn6681 on the conjugative plasmid pFM-M19 and the ability to transferand carbapenem resistance.  Methods A. johnsonii M19 was isolated under selection with 8 mg/L meropenem from hospital sewage, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the representative carbapenems imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem were determined. The genome of A. johnsonii M19 was sequenced by PacBio RS II and Illumina HiSeq 4000 platforms. A homologous model of OXA-23 was generated, and molecular docking models with imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem were constructed by Discovery Studio 2.0. Type IV secretion system and conjugation elements were identified by the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) server and the oriTfinder. Mating experiments were performed to evaluate transfer of OXA-23 to Escherichia coli 25DN. Results MICs of A. johnsonii M19 for imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem were 128 mg/L, 48 mg/L and 24 mg/L, respectively. Genome sequencing identified plasmid pFM-M19, which harbours the carbapenem resistance gene blaOXA-23 within the novel transposon Tn6681. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the elongated hydrophobic tunnel of OXA-23 provides a hydrophobic environment and that Lys-216, Thr-217, Met-221 and Arg-259 were the conserved amino acids bound to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem. Furthermore, pFM-M19 could transfer blaOXA-23 to E. coli 25DN by conjugation, resulting in carbapenem-resistant transconjugants.  Conclusions Our investigation showed that A. johnsonii M19 is a source and disseminator of blaOXA-23 and carbapenem resistance. The ability to transfer blaOXA-23 to other species by the conjugative plasmid pFM-M19 raises the risk of spread of carbapenem resistance. Graphic abstract The carbapenem resistance gene blaOXA-23 is disseminated by a conjugative plasmid containing the novel transposon Tn6681 in Acinetobacter johnsonii M19.
33177217/The Putative APSES Transcription Factor RgdA Governs Growth, Development, Toxigenesis, and Virulence in Aspergillus fumigatus Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to infections with the opportunistic human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. This fungus causes systemic infections such as invasive aspergillosis (IA), which is one of the most life-threatening fungal diseases. To control this serious disease, it is critical to identify new antifungal drug targets. In fungi, the transcriptional regulatory proteins of the APSES family play crucial roles in controlling various biological processes, including mating, asexual sporulation and dimorphic growth, and virulence traits. This study found that a putative APSES transcription factor, RgdA, regulates normal growth, asexual development, conidium germination, spore wall architecture and hydrophobicity, toxin production, and virulence in A. fumigatus. Better understanding the molecular mechanisms of RgdA in human-pathogenic fungi may reveal a novel antifungal target for future drug development. ABSTRACT The APSES transcription factor (TF) in Aspergillus species is known to govern diverse cellular processes, including growth, development, and secondary metabolism. Here, we investigated functions of the rgdA gene (Afu3g13920) encoding a putative APSES TF in the opportunistic human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The rgdA deletion resulted in significantly decreased hyphal growth and asexual sporulation. Consistently, transcript levels of the key asexual developmental regulators abaA, brlA, and wetA were decreased in the DeltargdA mutant compared to those in the wild type (WT). Moreover, DeltargdA resulted in reduced spore germination rates and elevated transcript levels of genes associated with conidium dormancy. The conidial cell wall hydrophobicity and architecture were changed, and levels of the RodA protein were decreased in the DeltargdA mutant. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that the DeltargdA mutant showed higher mRNA levels of gliotoxin (GT)-biosynthetic genes and GT production. While the DeltargdA mutant exhibited elevated production of GT, DeltargdA strains showed reduced virulence in the mouse model. In addition, mRNA levels of genes associated with the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and the SakA mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway were increased in the DeltargdA mutant. In summary, RgdA plays multiple roles in governing growth, development, GT production, and virulence which may involve attenuation of PKA and SakA signaling. IMPORTANCE Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to infections with the opportunistic human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. This fungus causes systemic infections such as invasive aspergillosis (IA), which is one of the most life-threatening fungal diseases. To control this serious disease, it is critical to identify new antifungal drug targets. In fungi, the transcriptional regulatory proteins of the APSES family play crucial roles in controlling various biological processes, including mating, asexual sporulation and dimorphic growth, and virulence traits. This study found that a putative APSES transcription factor, RgdA, regulates normal growth, asexual development, conidium germination, spore wall architecture and hydrophobicity, toxin production, and virulence in A. fumigatus. Better understanding the molecular mechanisms of RgdA in human-pathogenic fungi may reveal a novel antifungal target for future drug development.
33183219/The effect of concentration, reconstitution solution and pH on the stability of a remifentanil hydrochloride and propofol admixture for simultaneous co-infusion Background There are scenarios where pre-mixing and infusing analgesic and anaesthetic agents as a single intravenous (IV) solution is highly desirable; however, it is important to ensure the agents are compatible when mixed. As such, the long-term stability of a remifentanil-propofol mixture, and means of improving this, were assessed across a range of remifentanil concentrations, diluents, and time points. Methods Remifentanil was reconstituted with ultrapure water, 0.9% saline, 20% saline, or 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution (the latter two chosen for their pH characteristics, rather than their use in pharmaceutical reconstitution) and then mixed with propofol (1%) or further diluted with water to derive concentrations of 10-50 mug mL- 1. Remifentanil and propofol concentrations were determined initially and then periodically for up to 24 h using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to detect degradation products in solutions containing 30 mug mL- 1 of remifentanil. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t-test, with a significance value of 0.05. Results Isolated remifentanil (pH < 4) and propofol (pH 7.35) did not degrade significantly when reconstituted with water or saline solution over 24 h, while remifentanil reconstituted with sodium bicarbonate degraded significantly (P < 0.001, pH 8.65). Mixing with propofol substantially increased the pH of the mixture and resulted in significant remifentanil degradation for all reconstitution solutions used, while propofol remained stable (pH 6.50). The amount of degradation product detected in samples containing isolated remifentanil and a mixture of the drugs was proportional to the remifentanil degradation observed. Conclusions Remifentanil stability is affected by both the reconstitution solution used and when mixed with propofol, with pH appearing to be a contributing factor to degradation. If the pH of the solution and concentration of remifentanil are correctly controlled, e.g. through the use of a more acidic diluent, an admixture of remifentanil and propofol may be useful clinically.

33187518/Understanding the effects of beetroot juice intake on CrossFit performance by assessing hormonal, metabolic and mechanical response: a randomized, double-blind, crossover design Background Acute beetroot juice (BJ) intake has shown to enhance aerobic and anaerobic performance. However, no studies have evaluated the effects of BJ intake on CrossFit (CF) performance by linking hormonal, metabolic, and mechanical responses. The purpose of this study was to determine the causal physiological association between hormonal, metabolic and mechanical responses, and CF workouts performance after acute BJ intake. Methods Twelve well-trained male practitioners undertook a CF workout after drinking 140 mL of BJ (~ 12.8 mmol NO3-) or placebo. The two experimental conditions (BJ or placebo) were administered using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The CF workout consisted of repeating the same exercise routine twice: Wall ball (WB) shots plus full back squat (FBS) with 3-min rest (1st routine) or without rest (2nd routine) between the two exercises. A 3-min rest was established between the two exercise routines. Results An interaction effect was observed in the number of repetitions performed (p = 0.04). The Bonferroni test determined a higher number of repetitions after BJ than placebo intake when a 3-min rest between WB and FBS (1st routine) was established (p = 0.007). An interaction effect was detected in cortisol response (p = 0.04). Cortisol showed a higher increase after BJ compared to placebo intake (76% vs. 36%, respectively). No interaction effect was observed in the testosterone and testosterone/cortisol ratio (p > 0.05). A significant interaction effect was found in oxygen saturation (p = 0.01). A greater oxygen saturation drop was observed in BJ compared to placebo (p <  0.05). An interaction effect was verified in muscular fatigue (p = 0.03) with a higher muscular fatigue being observed with BJ than placebo (p = 0.02). Conclusions BJ intake improved anaerobic performance only after the recovery time between exercises. This increase in performance in the first routine probably generated greater hypoxia in the muscle mass involved, possibly conditioning post-exercise performance. This was observed with a fall in oxygen saturation and in muscle fatigue measured at the end of the CF workout. The greatest perceived changes in cortisol levels after BJ intake could be attributed to the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway.
33173002/The Transcription Factor SomA Synchronously Regulates Biofilm Formation and Cell Wall Homeostasis in Aspergillus fumigatus The cell wall is essential for fungal viability and is absent from human hosts; thus, drugs disrupting cell wall biosynthesis have gained more attention. Caspofungin is a member of a new class of clinically approved echinocandin drugs to treat invasive aspergillosis by blocking beta-1,3-glucan synthase, thus damaging the fungal cell wall. Here, we demonstrate that caspofungin and other cell wall stressors can induce galactosaminogalactan (GAG)-dependent biofilm formation in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We further identified SomA as a master transcription factor playing a dual role in both biofilm formation and cell wall homeostasis. SomA plays this dual role by direct binding to a conserved motif upstream of GAG biosynthetic genes and genes involved in cell wall stress sensors, chitin synthases, and beta-1,3-glucan synthase. Collectively, these findings reveal a transcriptional control pathway that integrates biofilm formation and cell wall homeostasis and suggest SomA as an attractive target for antifungal drug development. ABSTRACT Polysaccharides are key components of both the fungal cell wall and biofilm matrix. Despite having distinct assembly and regulation pathways, matrix exopolysaccharide and cell wall polysaccharides share common substrates and intermediates in their biosynthetic pathways. It is not clear, however, if the biosynthetic pathways governing the production of these polysaccharides are cooperatively regulated. Here, we demonstrate that cell wall stress promotes production of the exopolysaccharide galactosaminogalactan (GAG)-depend biofilm formation in the major fungal pathogen of humans Aspergillus fumigatus and that the transcription factor SomA plays a crucial role in mediating this process. A core set of SomA target genes were identified by transcriptome sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We identified a novel SomA-binding site in the promoter regions of GAG biosynthetic genes agd3 and ega3, as well as its regulators medA and stuA. Strikingly, this SomA-binding site was also found in the upstream regions of genes encoding the cell wall stress sensors, chitin synthases, and beta-1,3-glucan synthase. Thus, SomA plays a direct regulation of both GAG and cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. Consistent with these findings, SomA is required for the maintenance of normal cell wall architecture and compositions in addition to its function in biofilm development. Moreover, SomA was found to globally regulate glucose uptake and utilization, as well as amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, which provides precursors for polysaccharide synthesis. Collectively, our work provides insight into fungal adaptive mechanisms in response to cell wall stress where biofilm formation and cell wall homeostasis were synchronously regulated.
33173001/Plasmodium berghei K13 Mutations Mediate In Vivo Artemisinin Resistance That Is Reversed by Proteasome Inhibition Recent successes in malaria control have been seriously threatened by the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasite resistance to the frontline artemisinin drugs in Southeast Asia. P. falciparum artemisinin resistance is associated with mutations in the parasite K13 protein, which associates with a delay in the time required to clear the parasites upon drug treatment. Gene editing technologies have been used to validate the role of several candidate K13 mutations in mediating P. falciparum artemisinin resistance in vitro under laboratory conditions. Nonetheless, the causal role of these mutations under in vivo conditions has been a matter of debate. Here, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to introduce K13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance into the related rodent-infecting parasite, Plasmodium berghei. Phenotyping of these P. berghei K13 mutant parasites provides evidence of their role in mediating artemisinin resistance in vivo, which supports in vitro artemisinin resistance observations. However, we were unable to introduce some of the P. falciparum K13 mutations (C580Y and I543T) into the corresponding amino acid residues, while other introduced mutations (M476I and R539T equivalents) carried pronounced fitness costs. Our study provides evidence of a clear causal role of K13 mutations in modulating susceptibility to artemisinins in vitro and in vivo using the well-characterized P. berghei model. We also show that inhibition of the P. berghei proteasome offsets parasite resistance to artemisinins in these mutant lines. ABSTRACT The recent emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasite resistance to the first line antimalarial drug artemisinin is of particular concern. Artemisinin resistance is primarily driven by mutations in the P. falciparum K13 protein, which enhance survival of early ring-stage parasites treated with the artemisinin active metabolite dihydroartemisinin in vitro and associate with delayed parasite clearance in vivo. However, association of K13 mutations with in vivo artemisinin resistance has been problematic due to the absence of a tractable model. Herein, we have employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to engineer selected orthologous P. falciparum K13 mutations into the K13 gene of an artemisinin-sensitive Plasmodium berghei rodent model of malaria. Introduction of the orthologous P. falciparum K13 F446I, M476I, Y493H, and R539T mutations into P. berghei K13 yielded gene-edited parasites with reduced susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin in the standard 24-h in vitro assay and increased survival in an adapted in vitro ring-stage survival assay. Mutant P. berghei K13 parasites also displayed delayed clearance in vivo upon treatment with artesunate and achieved faster recrudescence upon treatment with artemisinin. Orthologous C580Y and I543T mutations could not be introduced into P. berghei, while the equivalents of the M476I and R539T mutations resulted in significant growth defects. Furthermore, a Plasmodium-selective proteasome inhibitor strongly synergized dihydroartemisinin action in these P. berghei K13 mutant lines, providing further evidence that the proteasome can be targeted to overcome artemisinin resistance. Taken together, our findings provide clear experimental evidence for the involvement of K13 polymorphisms in mediating susceptibility to artemisinins in vitro and, most importantly, under in vivo conditions.
33173003/Magnesium Sensing Regulates Intestinal Colonization of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sensing specific gut metabolites is an important strategy for inducing crucial virulence programs by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 during colonization and infection. Here, we identified a virulence-regulating pathway wherein the PhoQ/PhoP two-component regulatory system signals to the O island 119-encoded low magnesium-induced regulator A (LmiA), which, in turn, activates locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) genes to promote EHEC O157:H7 adherence in the low-magnesium conditions of the large intestine. This regulatory pathway is widely present in a range of EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) serotypes. Disruption of this pathway significantly decreased EHEC O157:H7 adherence in the mouse intestinal tract. Moreover, mice fed a magnesium-rich diet showed significantly reduced EHEC O157:H7 adherence in vivo, indicating that magnesium may help in preventing EHEC and EPEC infection in humans. ABSTRACT The large intestinal pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 detects host cues to regulate virulence gene expression during colonization and infection. However, virulence regulatory mechanisms of EHEC O157:H7 in the human large intestine are not fully understood. Herein, we identified a virulence-regulating pathway where the PhoQ/PhoP two-component regulatory system senses low magnesium levels and signals to the O island 119-encoded Z4267 (LmiA; low magnesium-induced regulator A), directly activating loci of enterocyte effacement genes to promote EHEC O157:H7 adherence in the large intestine. Disruption of this pathway significantly decreased EHEC O157:H7 adherence in the mouse intestinal tract. Moreover, feeding mice a magnesium-rich diet significantly reduced EHEC O157:H7 adherence in vivo. This LmiA-mediated virulence regulatory pathway is also conserved among several EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli serotypes; therefore, our findings support the use of magnesium as a dietary supplement and provide greater insights into the dietary cues that can prevent enteric infections.
33198812/The effect of grape seed and green tea extracts on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and its main metabolite, N-desmethyl imatinib, in rats Background Imatinib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by other isoenzymes, with N-desmethyl imatinib being its major equipotent metabolite. Being a CYP3A4 substrate, imatinib co-administration with CYP3A4 modulators would change its pharmacokinetic profile. The cancer chemoprevention potential and anticancer efficacy of many herbal products such as grape seed (GS) and green tea (GT) extracts had led to an increase in their concomitant use with anticancer agents. GS and GT extracts were demonstrated to be potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of standardized GS and/or GT extracts at two different doses on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and its metabolite, N-desmethyl imatinib, in SD-rats. Methods Standardized GS and/or GT extracts were administered orally once daily for 21 days, at low (l) and high (h) doses, 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively, before the administration of a single intragastric dose of imatinib. Plasma samples were collected and analyzed for imatinib and N-desmethyl imatinib concentrations using LC-MS/MS method, then their non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Results h-GS dose significantly decreased imatinib's Cmax and the  by 61.1 and 72.2%, respectively. Similar effects on N-desmethyl imatinib's exposure were observed as well, in addition to a significant increase in its clearance by 3.7-fold. l-GT caused a significant decrease in imatinib's Cmax and  by 53.6 and 63.5%, respectively, with more significant effects on N-desmethyl imatinib's exposure, which exhibited a significant decrease by 79.2 and 81.1%, respectively. h-GT showed similar effects as those of l-GT on the kinetics of imatinib and its metabolite. However, when these extracts were co-administered at low doses, no significant effects were shown on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and its metabolite. Nevertheless, increasing the dose caused a significant decrease in Cmax of N-desmethyl imatinib by 71.5%. Conclusions These results demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and N-desmethyl imatinib had been significantly affected by GS and/or GT extracts, which could be partially explained by the inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism. However, the involvement of other kinetic pathways such as other isoenzymes, efflux and uptake transporters could be involved and should be characterized.

33198755/Dietary and plasma blood alpha-linolenic acid as modulators of fat oxidation and predictors of aerobic performance Background Among n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the most important is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). The biological activity of ALA is not equivalent to that of the long-chain n-3 PUFAs, and it has pleiotropic effects, such as functioning as an energy substrate during long-term training when carbohydrate reserves are depleted. The purpose of this investigation was to study the link between the essential dietary and plasma ALA and aerobic performance, which is estimated via maximal fat oxidation (MFO), among skiers. Methods Twenty-four highly trained male athletes from the Russian cross-country skiing team participated in the study. ALA intake was determined by an original program used to assess the actual amount and frequency of fat consumption. The plasma level of ALA was determined using gas-liquid chromatography. The skiers' aerobic performance was estimated via MFO and determined by indirect calorimetry using the system "Oxycon Pro". Results The consumption of ALA in the diet in half of the skiers was below the recommended level at 0.5 +- 0.2 g/day. The deficiency of plasma ALA levels was on average 0.2 +- 0.1 Mol% for almost all participants. The consumption of ALA in the diet and its level in plasma were associated with MFO (rs = 0.507, p = 0.011; rs = 0.460, p = 0.023). Levels of ALA in plasma (p = 0.0523) and the consumption of ALA in the diet (p = 0.0039) were associated with high aerobic performance. Conclusions ALA in the diet of the athletes may be used as nutritional support to increase MFO and aerobic performance.
33203457/Bioprospecting the antimicrobial, antibiofilm and antiproliferative activity of Symplocos racemosa Roxb. Bark phytoconstituents along with their biosafety evaluation and detection of antimicrobial components by GC-MS Background Plants provide a ray of hope to combat the ever increasing antibiotic resistance and Symplocos racemosa is a valuable medicinal plant. The study focused on highlighting the importance of this plant's phytoconstituents as potential source of novel antimicrobials against planktonic as well as biofilm forming microorganisms, along with their antiproliferative activity. The biosafety of the phytoconstituents was also established, followed by detection of probable antimicrobial components. Methods The best organic extractant and major groups of phytoconstituents were tested for their antimicrobial activity against reference microbial strains and drug-resistant clinical isolates. The anti-proliferative potential of the most active group of phytoconstituents was evaluated against cancerous cell lines. The in vitro biosafety of phytoconstituents was evaluated by Ames and MTT assay, while in vivo biosafety of the most active phytoconstituents, i.e., flavonoids was determined by acute oral toxicity. Further, the probable antimicrobial components in the flavonoids were detected by TLC and GC-MS. Results Ethyl acetate extract was the most effective among various organic extracts, whereas phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, tannins, triterpenes and phytosterols were the major groups present, with flavonoids being the most potent antimicrobials. The phytoconstituents displayed a significant antibiofilm potential, as exhibited by inhibition of initial cell attachment, disruption of the pre-formed biofilms and reduced metabolic activity of biofilms. The phytoconstituents were significantly active against the drug-resistant strains of E.coli, MRSA and Salmonella spp. Further, flavonoids showed significant cytotoxic effect against the cancerous cell lines but were non-cytotoxic against Vero (normal) cell line. All the test preparations were biosafe, as depicted by the Ames test and MTT assay. Also, flavonoids did not induce any abnormality in body weight, clinical signs, biochemical parameters and organs' histopathology of the Swiss albino mice during in vivo acute oral toxicity studies. The flavonoids were resolved into 4 bands (S1-S4), where S3 was the most active and its GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of a number of compounds, where Bicyclo [2.2.1]heptan-2-one,1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- was the most abundant. Conclusions These findings suggest that the phytoconstituents from Symplocos racemosa bark could act as potential source of antimicrobial as well as antiproliferative metabolites.
33208089/Wound infiltration with ropivacaine as an adjuvant to patient controlled analgesia for transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion: a retrospective study Background Surgical procedure usually causes serious postoperative pain and poor postoperative pain management negatively affects quality of life, function and recovery time. We aimed to investigate the role of wound infiltration with ropivacaine as an adjuvant to patient controlled analgesia (PCA) in postoperative pain control for patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Methods One hundred twelve patients undergoing lumbar fusion were retrospectively reviewed and divided into two groups (ropivacaine and control groups) according to whether received wound infiltration with ropivacaine or not. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, analgesics consumption, number of patients requiring rescue analgesic, hospital duration and incidence of complications were recorded. Surgical trauma was assessed using operation time, intraoperative blood loss and incision length. Results The amount of sufentanil consumption in ropivacaine group at 4 h postoperatively was lower than that of control group (24.5 +- 6.0 mug vs 32.1 +- 7.0 mug, P < 0.001) and similar results were observed at 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h postoperatively(P < 0.001). Fewer patients required rescue analgesia within 4 to 8 h postoperatively in ropivacaine group (10/60 vs 19/52, P = 0.017). Length of postoperative hospital durations were shorter in patients receiving ropivacaine infiltration compared to control cohorts (6.9 +- 0.9 days vs 7.4 +- 0.9 days, P = 0.015). The incidence of PONV in ropivacaine group was lower than that in control group (40.4% vs 18.3%, P = 0.01). However, VAS scores were similar in two groups at each follow-up points postoperatively, and no difference was observed(P > 0.05). Conclusion Wound infiltration with ropivacaine effectively reduces postoperative opioid consumption and PONV and may be a useful adjuvant to PCA to improve recovery for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery.
33208519/Unique Mode of Cell Division by the Mycobacterial Genetic Resister Clones Emerging De Novo from the Antibiotic-Surviving Population The bacterial pathogens that are tolerant to antibiotics and survive in the continued presence of antibiotics have the chance to acquire genetically resistant mutations against the antibiotics and emerge de novo as antibiotic resisters. Once the antibiotic resister clone has emerged, often with compromise on growth characteristics, for the protection of the species, it is important to establish an antibiotic-resistant population quickly in the continued presence of the antibiotic. In this regard, the present study has unraveled multinucleation and multiseptation followed by multiple constrictions as the cellular processes used by the bacteria for quick multiplication to establish antibiotic-resistant populations. The study also points out the same phenomenon occurring in other bacterial systems investigated in our laboratory and others' laboratories. Identification of these specific cellular events involved in quick multiplication offers additional cellular processes that can be targeted in combination with the existing antibiotics' targets to preempt the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. ABSTRACT The emergence of antibiotic genetic resisters of pathogenic bacteria poses a major public health challenge. The mechanism by which bacterial antibiotic genetic resister clones formed de novo multiply and establish a resister population remained unknown. Here, we delineated the unique mode of cell division of the antibiotic genetic resisters of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis formed de novo from the population surviving in the presence of bactericidal concentrations of rifampicin or moxifloxacin. The cells in the rifampicin/moxifloxacin-surviving population generated elevated levels of hydroxyl radical-inflicting mutations. The genetic mutants selected against rifampicin/moxifloxacin became multinucleated and multiseptated and developed multiple constrictions. These cells stochastically divided multiple times, producing sister-daughter cells phenomenally higher in number than what could be expected from their generation time. This caused an abrupt, unexpectedly high increase in the rifampicin/moxifloxacin resister colonies. This unique cell division behavior was not shown by the rifampicin resisters formed naturally in the actively growing cultures. We could detect such abrupt increases in the antibiotic resisters in others' and our earlier data on the antibiotic-exposed laboratory/clinical M. tuberculosis strains, M. smegmatis and other bacteria in in vitro cultures, infected macrophages/animals, and tuberculosis patients. However, it went unnoticed/unreported in all those studies. This phenomenon occurring in diverse bacteria surviving against different antibiotics revealed the broad significance of the present study. We speculate that the antibiotic-resistant bacillary clones, which emerge in patients with diverse bacterial infections, might be using the same mechanism to establish an antibiotic resister population quickly in the continued presence of antibiotics. IMPORTANCE The bacterial pathogens that are tolerant to antibiotics and survive in the continued presence of antibiotics have the chance to acquire genetically resistant mutations against the antibiotics and emerge de novo as antibiotic resisters. Once the antibiotic resister clone has emerged, often with compromise on growth characteristics, for the protection of the species, it is important to establish an antibiotic-resistant population quickly in the continued presence of the antibiotic. In this regard, the present study has unraveled multinucleation and multiseptation followed by multiple constrictions as the cellular processes used by the bacteria for quick multiplication to establish antibiotic-resistant populations. The study also points out the same phenomenon occurring in other bacterial systems investigated in our laboratory and others' laboratories. Identification of these specific cellular events involved in quick multiplication offers additional cellular processes that can be targeted in combination with the existing antibiotics' targets to preempt the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
33213527/Bioequivalence of levamlodipine besylate tablets in healthy Chinese subjects: a single-dose and two-period crossover randomized study Background Levamlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been show act as a cardiovascular drug. To compare the pharmacokinetic parameters between levamlodipine (test formulation) at a single dose of 5 mg and amlodipine (reference formulation) at a single dose of 10 mg, the bioequivalence study was carried out. Methods A single-dose randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study was designed in healthy Chinese subjects. 48 subjects were divided into fasted and fed groups equally. The subjects randomly received the test or reference formulations at the rate of 1:1. Following a 21-day washout period, the alternative formulations were received. The blood samples were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 h later. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was applied to determine the plasma concentrations of levamlodipine. Adverse events were recorded. Results The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the ratio of geometric means (GMRs) of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-  under both fasted and fed conditions were within the prespecified bioequivalence limits between 80 ~ 125%. Under fasted conditions, 24 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. The mean Cmax was (2.70 +- 0.49) ng/mL, AUC0-t was (141.32 +- 36.24) ng x h/mL and AUC0-  was (157.14 +- 45.65) ng x h/mL after a single dose of 5 mg levamlodipine. The mean Cmax was (2.83 +- 0.52) ng/mL, AUC0-t was (153.62 +- 33.96) ng x h/mL and AUC0-  was (173.05 +- 41.78) ng x h/mL after a single dose of 10 mg amlodipine. Under fed conditions, 24 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. The mean Cmax was (2.73 +- 0.55) ng/mL, AUC0-t was (166.93 +- 49.96) ng x h/mL and AUC0-  was (190.99 +- 70.89) ng x h/mL after a single dose of 5 mg levamlodipine. The mean Cmax was (2.87 +- 0.81) ng/mL AUC0-t was (165.46 +- 43.58) ng x h/mL and AUC0-  was (189.51 +- 64.70) ng x h/mL after a single dose of 10 mg amlodipine. Serious adverse event was not observed. Conclusion The trial confirmed that levamlodipine at a single dose of 5 mg and amlodipine at a single dose of 10 mg were bioequivalent under both fasted condition and fed condition.

33213519/Two novel anticancer compounds with minimum cardiotoxic property Background Although two novel synthesized compounds with tri-aryl structures; 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazole (A) and 3,5-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazole (B) have been previously demonstrated to possess remarkable anti-breast cancer activity, their cardiotoxicity remains a major concern due to their mechanism of action. To address this concern, we assessed the ability of these compounds to cause toxicity towards H9c2 cardiomyocytes as an in vitro model of cardiotoxicity. Methods Cytotoxic activity of both compounds was explored in vitro on H9c2 cells using MTT assay. Annexin V/PI method, intracellular ROS determination and mitochondrial membrane potential assay were applied to elucidate the mechanism of action of the cell death. Results MTT assay revealed a concentration- and time-dependent cardiotoxicity. Findings of apoptosis by double staining with annexin V and propidium iodide divulged no cell death including apoptosis and necrosis at the concentration that were effective to inhibit cancer cells proliferation (10 muM) at 24 and 48 h. Furthermore, flow cytometric measurement of membrane potential and ROS determination using DCFH-DA verified the safe concentration of the compounds against H9c2 cells with no cardiotoxic effect. However, the higher concentration of the compounds could induce cell death through ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions Altogether, the results represented two novel chemical molecules possessing anti-breast cancer activity with minimum cardiac side effect.
33225899/Comparison of analgesic efficacy between rectus sheath blockade, intrathecal morphine with bupivacaine, and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: a prospective, observational clinical study Background We explored the analgesic outcomes on postoperative day (POD) 1 in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) who received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA), rectus sheath bupivacaine block (RSB), or intrathecal morphine with bupivacaine block (ITMB). Methods This was a prospective, observational clinical trial. Patients were divided into three groups: IV-PCA (n = 30), RSB (n = 30), and ITMB (n = 30). Peak pain scores at rest and with coughing, cumulative IV-PCA drug consumption, the need for IV rescue opioids, and Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) questionnaire scores collected on POD 1 were compared among the groups. Results The preoperative and intraoperative findings were comparable among the groups; the ITMB group required the least remifentanil of all groups. During POD 1, the ITMB group reported lower levels of pain at rest and with coughing, compared with the other two groups. During POD 1, incidences of severe pain at rest (10.0% vs. 23.3% vs. 40.0%) and with coughing (16.7% vs. 36.7% vs. 66.7%) were the lowest in the ITMB group compared with the RSB and IV-PCA groups, respectively. After adjustment for age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and intraoperative remifentanil infusion, severe pain at rest was 0.167-fold less common in the ITMB group than in the IV-PCA group, while pain with coughing was 0.1-fold lower in the ITMB group and 0.306-fold lower in the RSB group, compared with the IV-PCA group. The ITMB group required lower cumulative IV-PCA drug infusions and less IV rescue opioids, while exhibiting a better QoR-15 global score, compared with the other two groups. Complications (nausea and pruritus) were significantly more common in the ITMB group than in the other two groups; however, we noted no ITMB- or RSB-related anesthetic complications (respiratory depression, post-dural headache, nerve injury, or puncture site hematoma or infection), and all patients were assessed as Clavien-Dindo grade I or II during the hospital stay. Conclusion Although ITMB induced complications of nausea and pruritus, this analgesic technique provided appropriate pain relief that enhanced patient perception related to early postoperative recovery.

33203749/Direct and Indirect Inhibition of Salmonella Peptide Deformylase by Nitric Oxide We have previously shown that the host-derived antimicrobial mediator nitric oxide (NO ) mobilizes zinc from bacterial metalloproteins. The present study demonstrates that NO  inactivates the essential iron-containing enzyme peptide deformylase, both by promoting its mismetallation by zinc and by directly modifying its metal-binding site. We explain how free intracellular zinc is detrimental for cells and reveal a new mechanism of NO -mediated bacterial growth inhibition that is distinct from previously known targets. ABSTRACT Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an intracellular pathogen that elicits nitric oxide (NO ) production by host macrophages. NO  is a potent antimicrobial mediator with diverse targets, including protein thiols and metal centers. The mobilization of zinc from metalloproteins by NO  increases the availability of free intracellular zinc, which is detrimental to bacterial cells, but the precise mechanism of zinc cytotoxicity is uncertain. Here, we show that excess zinc results in the mismetallation of the essential iron-containing enzyme peptide deformylase (PDF), thereby diminishing its activity. PDF mismetallation is observed in zinc-treated bacteria lacking the zinc exporters ZntA and ZitB and is also observed during nitrosative stress, suggesting that NO -mediated zinc mobilization results in PDF mismetallation. However, NO  also inhibits PDF directly by S-nitrosylating the metal-binding Cys90 residue. These observations identify PDF as an essential bacterial protein that is subject to both direct and indirect inactivation by NO , providing a novel mechanism of zinc toxicity and NO -mediated antibacterial activity.
33203750/Na+-NQR Confers Aminoglycoside Resistance via the Regulation of l-Alanine Metabolism The Na+-NQR complex functions as a unique redox-driven sodium pump, generating membrane potential directly. However, whether it mediates generation of membrane potential indirectly is unknown. The present study shows that the Na+-NQR complex impacts membrane potential through other antiporter families Atp and Mnh. It proceeds by ATP and then cAMP/CRP regulon, which inhibits l-alanine catabolism and promotes l-alanine anabolism. When the Na+-NQR complex is reduced as in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, l-alanine is depressed, which is related to the antibiotic resistance phenotypes. However, exogenous l-alanine reverts the phenotype and promotes antibiotic-mediated killing. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the Na+-NQR system regulates antibiotic resistance via l-alanine metabolism in a cAMP/CRP complex-dependent manner. ABSTRACT Sodium-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) functions as a unique redox-driven sodium pump, generating membrane potential, which is related to aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance. However, whether it modulates other metabolisms to confer antibiotic resistance is unknown. The present study showed that loss of nqrA or nqrF led to differential metabolomes with elevated resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Decreased alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism and depressed abundance of alanine were characterized as the most impacted pathway and crucial biomarker, respectively. Further data showed that higher viability was detected in DeltanqrA and DeltanqrF mutant strains than their parent strain ATCC 33787 in the presence of gentamicin but recovered by exogenous l-alanine. It proceeds by the following events. The loss of nqrA or nqrF led to the decrease of membrane potential, ATPase activity, and then ATP and cyclic AMP (cAMP), which reduced the cAMP/CRP (cAMP receptor protein) complex. The reduced cAMP/CRP complex promoted l-alanine catabolism and inhibited l-alanine anabolism, causing reduced levels of alanine. Reduced alanine affected the expression of antiporter families Atp and Mnh genes. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which the Na+-NQR system regulates antibiotic resistance via l-alanine metabolism in a cAMP/CRP complex-dependent manner.
33203752/Staphylococcal DNA Repair Is Required for Infection To cause infection, bacteria must survive attack by the host immune system. For many bacteria, including the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, the greatest threat is posed by neutrophils. These immune cells ingest the invading organisms and try to kill them with a cocktail of chemicals that includes reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ability of S. aureus to survive this attack is crucial for the progression of infection. However, it was not clear how the ROS damaged S. aureus and how the bacterium repaired this damage. In this work, we show that ROS cause breaks in the staphylococcal DNA, which must be repaired by a two-protein complex known as RexAB; otherwise, the bacterium is killed, and it cannot sustain infection. This provides information on the type of damage that neutrophils cause S. aureus and the mechanism by which this damage is repaired, enabling infection. ABSTRACT To cause infection, Staphylococcus aureus must withstand damage caused by host immune defenses. However, the mechanisms by which staphylococcal DNA is damaged and repaired during infection are poorly understood. Using a panel of transposon mutants, we identified the rexBA operon as being important for the survival of Staphylococcus aureus in whole human blood. Mutants lacking rexB were also attenuated for virulence in murine models of both systemic and skin infections. We then demonstrated that RexAB is a member of the AddAB family of helicase/nuclease complexes responsible for initiating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Using a fluorescent reporter system, we were able to show that neutrophils cause staphylococcal DNA double-strand breaks through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the respiratory burst, which are repaired by RexAB, leading to the induction of the mutagenic SOS response. We found that RexAB homologues in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus gordonii also promoted the survival of these pathogens in human blood, suggesting that DNA double-strand break repair is required for Gram-positive bacteria to survive in host tissues. Together, these data demonstrate that DNA is a target of host immune cells, leading to double-strand breaks, and that the repair of this damage by an AddAB-family enzyme enables the survival of Gram-positive pathogens during infection.
33203757/Characterization of Posttranslationally Modified Multidrug Efflux Pumps Reveals an Unexpected Link between Glycosylation and Antimicrobial Resistance Nearly all bacterial species have at least a single glycosylation system, but the direct effects of these posttranslational protein modifications are unresolved. Glycoproteome-wide analysis of several bacterial pathogens has revealed general glycan modifications of virulence factors and protein assemblies. Using Campylobacter jejuni as a model organism, we have studied the role of general N-linked glycans in the multidrug efflux pump commonly found in Gram-negative bacteria. We show, for the first time, the direct link between N-linked glycans and multidrug efflux pump activity. At the protein level, we demonstrate that N-linked glycans play a role in enhancing protein thermostability and mediating the assembly of the multidrug efflux pump to promote antimicrobial resistance, highlighting the importance of this posttranslational modification in bacterial physiology. Similar roles for glycans are expected to be found in other Gram-negative pathogens that possess general protein glycosylation systems. ABSTRACT The substantial rise in multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is a current global imperative. Cumulative efforts to characterize antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has demonstrated the spread of six families of multidrug efflux pumps, of which resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) is the major mechanism of multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. RND is composed of a tripartite protein assembly and confers resistance to a range of unrelated compounds. In the major enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, the three protein components of RND are posttranslationally modified with N-linked glycans. The direct role of N-linked glycans in C. jejuni and other bacteria has long been elusive. Here, we present the first detailed account of the role of N-linked glycans and the link between N-glycosylation and antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni. We demonstrate the multifunctional role of N-linked glycans in enhancing protein thermostability, stabilizing protein complexes and the promotion of protein-protein interaction, thus mediating antimicrobial resistance via enhancing multidrug efflux pump activity. This affirms that glycosylation is critical for multidrug efflux pump assembly. We present a generalized strategy that could be used to investigate general glycosylation system in Campylobacter genus and a potential target to develop antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
33228793/Differential expression of microRNAs in the hippocampi of male and female rodents after chronic alcohol administration Background Women are more vulnerable than men to the neurotoxicity and severe brain damage caused by chronic heavy alcohol use. In addition, brain damage due to chronic heavy alcohol use may be associated with sex-dependent epigenetic modifications. This study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes that are differentially expressed in the hippocampi of male and female animal models in response to alcohol. Methods After chronic alcohol administration (3~3.5 g/kg/day) in male (control, n = 10; alcohol, n = 12) or female (control, n = 10; alcohol, n = 12) Sprague-Dawley rats for 6 weeks, we measured body weights and doublecortin (DCX; a neurogenesis marker) concentrations and analyzed up- or downregulated miRNAs using GeneChip miRNA 4.0 arrays. The differentially expressed miRNAs and their putative target genes were validated by RT-qPCR. Results Alcohol attenuated body weight gain only in the male group. On the other hand, alcohol led to increased serum AST in female rats and decreased serum total cholesterol concentrations in male rats. The expression of DCX was significantly reduced in the hippocampi of male alcohol-treated rats. Nine miRNAs were significantly up- or downregulated in male alcohol-treated rats, including upregulation of miR-125a-3p, let-7a-5p, and miR-3541, and downregulation of their target genes (Prdm5, Suv39h1, Ptprz1, Mapk9, Ing4, Wt1, Nkx3-1, Dab2ip, Rnf152, Ripk1, Lin28a, Apbb3, Nras, and Acvr1c). On the other hand, 7 miRNAs were significantly up- or downregulated in alcohol-treated female rats, including downregulation of miR-881-3p and miR-504 and upregulation of their target genes (Naa50, Clock, Cbfb, Arih1, Ube2g1, and Gng7). Conclusions These results suggest that chronic heavy alcohol use produces sex-dependent effects on neurogenesis and miRNA expression in the hippocampus and that sex differences should be considered when developing miRNA biomarkers to diagnose or treat alcoholics.

33228692/Association of dietary pattern and physical activity with lipid-related indices among Chinese population: a cross-sectional study Background and objectives To explore the relationship between dietary patterns, physical activity and lipid-related indices in Chinese Population. Methods and study design This study included 21,472 (72.3% men) participants aged 16 to 78 years. Data of anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests and questionnaires were collected through a physical examination. Diet patterns were identified through factor analysis and five patterns were retained ("meat," "high-energy," "high-protein," "healthy" and "traditional Chinese"). Physical activity was classified into low, moderate, or high. Abnormalities in lipid indices were assessed using the Adult Treatment Panel III criterion. Results Higher factor scores of "high-protein" pattern and "healthy" pattern were found to be related to favorable lipid indices. Quartiles 3 and 4 of "meat" pattern showed increased risks of having elevates total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Participants with higher levels of physical activity showed lowest risk of abnormal lipid profiles. All the associations were equally established among men, while most were no longer significant among women. Conclusions Higher physical activity level and a dietary pattern consists of high-quality protein foods, vegetables and fruits were associated with favorable lipid profiles, and these lifestyle factors were related to the risk of dyslipidemia in a sex-specific way.
33228767/Selective deletion of endothelial mineralocorticoid receptor protects from vascular dysfunction in sodium-restricted female mice Background Recent evidence by our laboratory demonstrates that women and female mice endogenously express higher endothelial mineralocorticoid receptor (ECMR) than males. Mounting clinical evidence also indicates that aldosterone production is higher in pathological conditions in females compared to males. However, the role for increased activation of ECMR by aldosterone in the absence of a comorbid condition is yet to be explored. The current study hypothesized that increased ECMR activation induced by elevated aldosterone production predisposes healthy female mice to endothelial dysfunction. Method Vascular reactivity was assessed in aortic rings from wild-type (WT) and ECMR KO (KO) mice fed either a normal salt (NSD, 0.4% NaCl) or sodium-restricted diet (SRD, 0.05% NaCl) for 28 days. Results SRD elevated plasma aldosterone levels as well as adrenal CYP11B2 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expressions in female, but not male, WT mice. In baseline conditions (NSD), endothelial function, assessed by vascular relaxation to acetylcholine, was higher while vascular contractility to phenylephrine, serotonin, and KCl lower in female than male WT mice. SRD impaired endothelial function and increased vascular contractility in female, but not male, WT mice effectively ablating the baseline sex differences. NOS inhibition with LNAME ablated endothelial relaxation to a higher extent in male than female mice on NSD and ablated differences in acetylcholine relaxation responses between NSD- and SRD-fed females, indicating a role for NO in SRD-mediated endothelial function. In association, SRD significantly reduced vascular NOX4 expression in female, but not male, mice. Lastly, selective deletion of ECMR protected female mice from SRD-mediated endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular contractility. Conclusion Collectively, these data indicate that female mice develop aldosterone-induced endothelial dysfunction via endothelial MR-mediated reductions in NO bioavailability. In addition, these data support a role for ECMR to promote vascular contractility in female mice in response to sodium restriction.
33281506/Determination of Macro- and Microelements in the Inflorescences of Banana Tree Using ICP OES: Evaluation of the Daily Recommendations of Intake for Humans The inflorescence of Musa paradisiaca, known as "banana heart" is a structure that includes flowers and bracts of banana, commonly used as food source worldwide. The aims of this study were (1) to determine the mineral components of Musa paradisiaca and (2) to compare the obtained results with previously reported data of Recommendation Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and edible plant permissible limits set by FAO/WHO. The samples were digested using microwave-assisted equipment, while elemental contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES). Metal (Mg, Ca, Cr, Ni, Cu, Fe, and Zn) and nonmetal (S and P) contents were detected. According to RDA, the inflorescences could be excellent sources of Mg, P, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Fe for females, males, and pregnant women, all age 31-50 y, as well as children (4-8 y). Bracts are good source of Zn for male and pregnant women and good source of Fe for children. All the samples contained considerable amounts of Mg, Ca, P, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Fe, which were quite low to induce deleterious effects (UL). FAO/WHO limits for edible plants have not yet been established for S, P, Mg, and Ca, but Ni and Zn are below of those limit values. However, Cr and Cu concentrations are higher than the values established for edible plants and may pose a threat to human health. Farmers should be encouraged by government agencies, not only for sustainability of production but also to ensure the storage and trade of banana tree inflorescence.
33239093/Attenuation of LPS-induced acute lung injury by continentalic acid in rodents through inhibition of inflammatory mediators correlates with increased Nrf2 protein expression Background Acute lung injury (ALI) together with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with high rate of mortality and morbidity in patients. In the current study, the anti-inflammatory effects of continentalic acid (CNT) in LPS-induced acute lung injury model was explored. Methods The acute lung injury model was established by administering LPS (5 mg/kg) intraperitonealy. Following LPS administration, the survival rate, temperature changes and lung Wet/Dry ratio were assessed. The antioxidants (GSH, GST, Catalase and SOD) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, NO, MPO) were evaluated in all the treated groups. Similarly, the cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were analyzed using ELISA assay. The histological changes were determined using H and E staining, while Nrf2 and iNOS level were determined using immunohistochemistry analysis. The molecular docking analysis was performed to assess the pharmacokinetics parameters and interaction of the CNT with various protein targets. Results The results showed that CNT dose dependently (10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) reduced mortality rate, body temperature and lungs Wet/Dry ratio. CNT post-treatment significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The CNT post-treatment markedly improved the hematological parameters, while significantly reduced the MPO (indicator of the neutrophilic infiltration) activity compared to the LPS treated group. Furthermore, the CNT (100 mg/kg) post-administration remarkably inhibited the lung Wet/Dry ratio. The CNT (100 mg/kg) treated group showed marked reduction in the oxidative stress markers such as malonaldehyde (MDA) and Nitric oxide (NO) concentration, while induced the level of the anti-oxidant enzymes such as GST, GSH, Catalase and SOD. Similarly, the CNT markedly reduced the iNOS expression level, while induced the Nrf2 protein expression. Additionally, the molecular docking study showed significant binding interaction with the Nrf2, p65, Keap1, HO-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and COX-2, while exhibited excellent physicochemical properties. Conclusion The CNT showed marked protection against the LPS-induced lung injury and improved the behavioral, biochemical and histological parameters. Furthermore, the CNT showed significant interaction with several protein targets and exhibited better physicochemical properties.
33238883/Sex-dimorphic neuroestradiol regulation of ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus glucoregulatory transmitter and glycogen metabolism enzyme protein expression in the rat Background Ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) gluco-regulatory transmission is subject to sex-specific control by estradiol. The VMN is characterized by high levels of aromatase expression. Methods The aromatase inhibitor letrozole (LZ) was used with high-resolution microdissection/Western blot techniques to address the hypothesis that neuroestradiol exerts sex-dimorphic control of VMN neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and glutamate decarboxylase65/67 (GAD) protein expression. Glycogen metabolism impacts VMN nNOS and GAD profiles; here, LZ treatment effects on VMN glycogen synthase (GS) and phosphorylase brain- (GPbb; glucoprivic-sensitive) and muscle (GPmm; norepinephrine-sensitive) variant proteins were examined. Results VMN aromatase protein content was similar between sexes. Intracerebroventricular LZ infusion of testes-intact male and ovariectomized, estradiol-replaced female rats blocked insulin-induced hypoglycemic (IIH) up-regulation of this profile. LZ exerted sex-contingent effects on basal VMN nNOS and GAD expression, but blocked IIH-induced NO stimulation and GAD suppression in each sex. Sex-contingent LZ effects on basal and hypoglycemic patterns of GPbb and GPmm expression occurred at distinctive levels of the VMN. LZ correspondingly down- or up-regulated baseline pyruvate recycling pathway marker protein expression in males (glutaminase) and females (malic enzyme-1), and altered INS effects on those proteins. Conclusions Results infer that neuroestradiol is required in each sex for optimal VMN metabolic transmitter signaling of hypoglycemic energy deficiency. Sex differences in VMN GP variant protein levels and sensitivity to aromatase may correlate with sex-dimorphic glycogen mobilization during this metabolic stress. Neuroestradiol may also exert sex-specific effects on glucogenic amino acid energy yield by actions on distinctive enzyme targets in each sex.
33243149/Determination of the ED95 of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine with sufentanil for scheduled cesarean delivery: a dose-finding study based on the continual reassessment method Background Scheduled cesarean section is routinely performed under spinal anesthesia using hyperbaric bupivacaine. The current study was undertaken to determine the clinically relevant 95% effective dose of intrathecal 2% hyperbaric prilocaine co-administered with sufentanil for scheduled cesarean section, using continual reassessment method. Methods We conducted a dose-response, prospective, double-blinded study to determine the ED95 values of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine used with 2,5 mcg of sufentanil and 100 mcg of morphine for cesarean delivery. Each parturient enrolled in the study received an intrathecal dose of hyperbaric prilocaine determined by the CRM and the success or failure of the block was assessed as being the primary endpoint. Results The doses given for each cohort varied from 35 to 50 mg of HP, according to the CRM, with a final ED95 lying between 45 and 50 mg of Prilocaine after completion of the 10 cohorts. Few side effects were reported and patients were globally satisfied. Conclusions The ED95 of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine with sufentanil 2.5 mug and morphine 100 mug for elective cesarean delivery was found to be between 45 and 50 mg. It may be an interesting alternative to other long-lasting local anesthetics in this context. Trial registration The study was registered on January 30, 2017 - retrospectively registered - and results posted at the public database clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03036384).
33239040/Association between the alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ratio and new-onset non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a nonobese Chinese population: a population-based longitudinal study Background The alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ratio has been considered an alternative marker for hepatic steatosis. However, few studies have investigated the association of the ALT/AST ratio with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in nonobese people. Methods A total of 12,127 nonobese participants who were free of NAFLD participated in this study. The participants were divided into quintiles of the ALT/AST ratio. Multiple Cox regression models were used to explore the association of the ALT/AST ratio with new-onset NAFLD. Results During the five-year follow-up period, 2147 individuals (17.7%) developed new-onset NAFLD. After adjusting for all non-collinear covariates, the multiple Cox regression analysis results showed that a higher ALT/AST ratio was independently associated with new-onset NAFLD in nonobese Chinese (adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs]: 2.10, 95% confidence intervals: 1.88, 2.36). The aHRs for NAFLD across increasing quintiles of the ALT/AST ratio were 1, 1.63 (1.30, 2.04), 2.07 (1.65, 2.60), 2.84 (2.33, 3.48) and 3.49 (2.78, 4.39) (P for trend< 0.001). The positive association was more significant among people with high blood pressure, high blood lipids and hyperglycaemia, as well as in men. Additionally, the regression spline showed that the saturation effect of the ALT/AST ratio on NAFLD risk was at 0.93 in this study population, which was 1.22 in males and 0.89 in females. Conclusions In nonobese Chinese individuals without NAFLD at baseline, the increase in the ALT/AST ratio is closely associated with the risk of new-onset NAFLD.

33105696/Human P2X7 Receptor Causes Cycle Arrest in RPMI-8226 Myeloma Cells to Alter the Interaction with Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts Multiple myeloma is a malignant expansion of plasma cells and aggressively affects bone health. We show that P2X7 receptor altered myeloma growth, which affects primary bone cells in vitro. Expression on six human myeloma cell lines confirmed the heterogeneity associated with P2X7 receptor. Pharmacology with 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP) as agonist showed dose-dependent membranal pores on RPMI-8226 (p = 0.0027) and blockade with P2X7 receptor antagonists. Ca2+ influx with increasing doses of BzATP (p = 0.0040) was also inhibited with antagonists. Chronic P2X7 receptor activation reduced RPMI-8226 viability (p = 0.0208). No apoptosis or RPMI-8226 death was observed by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) labeling and caspase-3 cleavage, respectively. However, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling showed an accumulation of RPMI-8226 in the S phase of cell cycle progression (61.5%, p = 0.0114) with significant decline in G0/G1 (5.2%, p = 0.0086) and G2/M (23.5%, p = 0.0015) phases. As myeloma pathology depends on a positive and proximal interaction with bone, we show that P2X7 receptor on RPMI-8226 inhibited the myeloma-induced suppression on mineralization (p = 0.0286) and reversed the excessive osteoclastic resorption. Our results demonstrate a view of how myeloma cell growth is halted by P2X7 receptor and the consequences on myeloma-osteoblast and myeloma-osteoclast interaction in vitro.
33105603/Simvastatin Induces Unfolded Protein Response and Enhances Temozolomide-Induced Cell Death in Glioblastoma Cells Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumor with a very poor survival rate. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the common chemotherapeutic agent used for GBM treatment. We recently demonstrated that simvastatin (Simva) increases TMZ-induced apoptosis via the inhibition of autophagic flux in GBM cells. Considering the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in the regulation of autophagy, we investigated the involvement of UPR in Simva-TMZ-induced cell death by utilizing highly selective IRE1 RNase activity inhibitor MKC8866, PERK inhibitor GSK-2606414 (PERKi), and eIF2alpha inhibitor salubrinal. Simva-TMZ treatment decreased the viability of GBM cells and significantly increased apoptotic cell death when compared to TMZ or Simva alone. Simva-TMZ induced both UPR, as determined by an increase in GRP78, XBP splicing, eukaryote initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation, and inhibited autophagic flux (accumulation of LC3beta-II and inhibition of p62 degradation). IRE1 RNase inhibition did not affect Simva-TMZ-induced cell death, but it significantly induced p62 degradation and increased the microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3 (LC3)beta-II/LC3beta-I ratio in U87 cells, while salubrinal did not affect the Simva-TMZ induced cytotoxicity of GBM cells. In contrast, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) inhibition significantly increased Simva-TMZ-induced cell death in U87 cells. Interestingly, whereas PERK inhibition induced p62 accumulation in both GBM cell lines, it differentially affected the LC3beta-II/LC3beta-I ratio in U87 (decrease) and U251 (increase) cells. Simvastatin sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ-induced cell death via a mechanism that involves autophagy and UPR pathways. More specifically, our results imply that the IRE1 and PERK signaling arms of the UPR regulate Simva-TMZ-mediated autophagy flux inhibition in U251 and U87 GBM cells. 
33105719/Curcumin's Beneficial Effects on Neuroblastoma: Mechanisms, Challenges, and Potential Solutions Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound derived from the South Asian turmeric plant (Curcuma longa), has well-characterized antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-protein-aggregate, and anticancer properties. Neuroblastoma (NB) is a cancer of the nervous system that arises primarily in pediatric patients. In order to reduce the multiple disadvantages and side effects of conventional oncologic modalities and to potentially overcome cancer drug resistance, natural substances such as curcumin are examined as complementary and supportive therapies against NB. In NB cell lines, curcumin by itself promotes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through the suppression of serine-threonine kinase Akt and nuclear factor kappa of activated B-cells (NF-kappaB) signaling, induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, and upregulation of p53 and caspase signaling. While curcumin demonstrates anti-NB efficacy in vitro, cross-validation between NB cell types is currently lacking for many of its specific mechanistic activities. Furthermore, curcumin's low bioavailability by oral administration, poor absorption, and relative insolubility in water pose challenges to its clinical introduction. Numerous curcumin formulations, including nanoparticles, nanocarriers, and microemulsions, have been developed, with these having some success in the treatment of NB. In the future, standardization and further basic and preclinical trials will be required to ensure the safety of curcumin formulations. While the administration of curcumin is clinically safe even at high doses, clinical trials are necessary to substantiate the practical efficacy of curcumin in the prevention and treatment of NB.
33105882/Divergent Effects of G2019S and R1441C LRRK2 Mutations on LRRK2 and Rab10 Phosphorylations in Mouse Tissues Mutations in LRRK2 cause familial Parkinson's disease and common variants increase disease risk. LRRK2 kinase activity and cellular localization are tightly regulated by phosphorylation of key residues, primarily Ser1292 and Ser935, which impacts downstream phosphorylation of its substrates, among which Rab10. A comprehensive characterization of LRRK2 activity and phosphorylation in brain as a function of age and mutations is missing. Here, we monitored Ser935 and Ser1292 phosphorylation in midbrain, striatum, and cortex of 1, 6, and 12 months-old mice carrying G2019S and R1441C mutations or murine bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-Lrrk2-G2019S. We observed that G2019S and, at a greater extent, R1441C brains display decreased phospho-Ser935, while Ser1292 autophosphorylation increased in G2019S but not in R1441C brain, lung, and kidney compared to wild-type. Further, Rab10 phosphorylation, is elevated in R1441C carrying mice, indicating that the effect of LRRK2 mutations on substrate phosphorylation is not generalizable. In BAC-Lrrk2-G2019S striatum and midbrain, Rab10 phosphorylation, but not Ser1292 autophosphorylation, decreases at 12-months, pointing to autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation as uncoupled events. Taken together, our study provides novel evidence that LRRK2 phosphorylation in mouse brain is differentially impacted by mutations, brain area, and age, with important implications as diagnostic markers of disease progression and stratification.
33105904/Biophysical and Lipidomic Biomarkers of Cardiac Remodeling Post-Myocardial Infarction in Humans Few studies have analyzed the potential of biophysical parameters as markers of cardiac remodeling post-myocardial infarction (MI), particularly in human hearts. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) illustrates the overall changes in proteins, nucleic acids and lipids in a single signature. The aim of this work was to define the FTIR and lipidomic pattern for human left ventricular remodeling post-MI. A total of nine explanted hearts from ischemic cardiomyopathy patients were collected. Samples from the right ventricle (RV), left ventricle (LV) and infarcted left ventricle (LV INF) were subjected to biophysical (FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry, DSC) and lipidomic (liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, LC-HRMS) studies. FTIR evidenced deep alterations in the myofibers, extracellular matrix proteins, and the hydric response of the LV INF compared to the RV or LV from the same subject. The lipid and esterified lipid FTIR bands were enhanced in LV INF, and both lipid indicators were tightly and positively correlated with remodeling markers such as collagen, lactate, polysaccharides, and glycogen in these samples. Lipidomic analysis revealed an increase in several species of sphingomyelin (SM), hexosylceramide (HexCer), and cholesteryl esters combined with a decrease in glycerophospholipids in the infarcted tissue. Our results validate FTIR indicators and several species of lipids as useful markers of left ventricular remodeling post-MI in humans.
33114049/Dual Effects of Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methylbutyrate (HMB) on Amino Acid, Energy, and Protein Metabolism in the Liver and Muscles of Rats with Streptozotocin-Induced Type 1 Diabetes Beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) is a unique product of leucine catabolism with positive effects on protein balance. We have examined the effects of HMB (200 mg/kg/day via osmotic pump for 7 days) on rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally). STZ induced severe diabetes associated with muscle wasting, decreased ATP in the liver, and increased alpha-ketoglutarate in muscles. In plasma, liver, and muscles increased branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, isoleucine, and leucine) and decreased serine. The decreases in mass and protein content of muscles and increases in BCAA concentration were more pronounced in extensor digitorum longus (fast-twitch muscle) than in soleus muscle (slow-twitch muscle). HMB infusion to STZ-treated animals increased glycemia and serine in the liver, decreased BCAAs in plasma and muscles, and decreased ATP in the liver and muscles. The effects of HMB on the weight and protein content of tissues were nonsignificant. We concluded that fast-twitch muscles are more sensitive to STZ than slow-twitch muscles and that HMB administration to STZ-treated rats has dual effects. Adjustments of BCAA concentrations in plasma and muscles and serine in the liver can be considered beneficial, whereas the increased glycemia and decreased ATP concentrations in the liver and muscles are detrimental.
33239365/Whole-Genome Sequence Analysis of an Extensively Drug-Resistant Salmonella enterica Serovar Agona Isolate from an Australian Silver Gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) Reveals the Acquisition of Multidrug Resistance Plasmids Defining environmental reservoirs hosting mobile genetic elements that shuttle critically important antibiotic resistance genes is key to understanding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from a One Health perspective. Gulls frequent public amenities, parklands, and sewage and other waste disposal sites and carry drug-resistant Escherichia coli. ABSTRACT Although most of the approximately 94 million annual human cases of gastroenteritis due to Salmonella enterica resolve without medical intervention, antimicrobial therapy is recommended for patients with severe disease. Wild birds can be natural hosts of Salmonella that pose a threat to human health; however, multiple-drug-resistant serovars of S. enterica have rarely been described. In 2012, silver gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) chicks at a major breeding colony were shown to host Salmonella, most isolates of which were susceptible to antibiotics. However, multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli with resistance to carbapenems, ceftazidime, and fluoroquinolones was reported from this breeding colony. In this paper, we describe a novel MDR Salmonella strain subsequently isolated from the same breeding colony. SG17-135, an isolate of S. enterica with phenotypic resistance to 12 individual antibiotics but only nine antibiotic classes including penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (trimethoprim), sulfonamides, and glycylcyclines was recovered from a gull chick in 2017. Whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis of SG17-135 identified it as Salmonella enterica serovar Agona (S. Agona) with a chromosome comprising 4,813,284 bp, an IncHI2 ST2 plasmid (pSG17-135-HI2) of 311,615 bp, and an IncX1 plasmid (pSG17-135-X) of 27,511 bp. pSG17-135-HI2 housed a complex resistance region comprising 16 antimicrobial resistance genes including blaCTX-M-55. The acquisition of MDR plasmids by S. enterica described here poses a serious threat to human health. Our study highlights the importance of taking a One Health approach to identify environmental reservoirs of drug-resistant pathogens and MDR plasmids. IMPORTANCE Defining environmental reservoirs hosting mobile genetic elements that shuttle critically important antibiotic resistance genes is key to understanding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from a One Health perspective. Gulls frequent public amenities, parklands, and sewage and other waste disposal sites and carry drug-resistant Escherichia coli. Here, we report on SG17-135, a strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Agona isolated from the cloaca of a silver gull chick nesting on an island in geographic proximity to the greater metropolitan area of Sydney, Australia. SG17-135 is closely related to pathogenic strains of S. Agona, displays resistance to nine antimicrobial classes, and carries important virulence gene cargo. Most of the antibiotic resistance genes hosted by SG17-135 are clustered on a large IncHI2 plasmid and are flanked by copies of IS26. Wild birds represent an important link in the evolution and transmission of resistance plasmids, and an understanding of their behavior is needed to expose the interplay between clinical and environmental microbial communities.
33239367/Combinatorial Biosynthesis of Sulfated Benzenediol Lactones with a Phenolic Sulfotransferase from Fusarium graminearum PH-1 Sulfation is an expedient strategy to increase the solubility, bioavailability, and bioactivity of nutraceuticals and clinically important drugs. However, chemical or biological synthesis of sulfoconjugates is challenging. ABSTRACT Total biosynthesis or whole-cell biocatalytic production of sulfated small molecules relies on the discovery and implementation of appropriate sulfotransferase enzymes. Although fungi are prominent biocatalysts and have been used to sulfate drug-like phenolics, no gene encoding a sulfotransferase enzyme has been functionally characterized from these organisms. Here, we identify a phenolic sulfotransferase, FgSULT1, by genome mining from the plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum PH-1. We expressed FgSULT1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae chassis to modify a broad range of benzenediol lactones and their nonmacrocyclic congeners, together with an anthraquinone, with the resulting unnatural natural product (uNP) sulfates displaying increased solubility. FgSULT1 shares low similarity with known animal and plant sulfotransferases. Instead, it forms a sulfotransferase family with putative bacterial and fungal enzymes for phase II detoxification of xenobiotics and allelochemicals. Among fungi, putative FgSULT1 homologues are encoded in the genomes of Fusarium spp. and a few other genera in nonsyntenic regions, some of which may be related to catabolic sulfur recycling. Computational structure modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis revealed that FgSULT1 retains the key catalytic residues and the typical fold of characterized animal and plant sulfotransferases. Our work opens the way for the discovery of hitherto unknown fungal sulfotransferases and provides a synthetic biological and enzymatic platform that can be adapted to produce bioactive sulfates, together with sulfate ester standards and probes for masked mycotoxins, precarcinogenic toxins, and xenobiotics. IMPORTANCE Sulfation is an expedient strategy to increase the solubility, bioavailability, and bioactivity of nutraceuticals and clinically important drugs. However, chemical or biological synthesis of sulfoconjugates is challenging. Genome mining, heterologous expression, homology structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis identified FgSULT1 of Fusarium graminearum PH-1 as a cytosolic sulfotransferase with the typical fold and active site architecture of characterized animal and plant sulfotransferases, despite low sequence similarity. FgSULT1 homologues are sparse in fungi but form a distinct clade with bacterial sulfotransferases. This study extends the functionally characterized sulfotransferase superfamily to the kingdom Fungi and demonstrates total biosynthetic and biocatalytic synthetic biological platforms to produce unnatural natural product (uNP) sulfoconjugates. Such uNP sulfates may be utilized for drug discovery in human and veterinary medicine and crop protection. Our synthetic biological methods may also be adapted to generate masked mycotoxin standards for food safety and environmental monitoring applications and to expose precarcinogenic xenobiotics.
33239368/Elucidation of DNA Repair Function of PfBlm and Potentiation of Artemisinin Action by a Small-Molecule Inhibitor of RecQ Helicase Malaria continues to be a serious threat to humankind not only because of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease but also due to the huge economic burden that it imparts. Resistance to all available drugs and the unavailability of an effective vaccine cry for an urgent discovery of newer drug targets. ABSTRACT Artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapies are recommended as first- and second-line treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Here, we investigated the impact of the RecQ inhibitor ML216 on the repair of ART-mediated damage in the genome of P. falciparum. PfBLM and PfWRN were identified as members of the RecQ helicase family in P. falciparum. However, the role of these RecQ helicases in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in this parasite has not been explored. Here, we provide several lines of evidence to establish the involvement of PfBlm in DSB repair in P. falciparum. First, we demonstrate that PfBlm interacts with two well-characterized DSB repair proteins of this parasite, namely, PfRad51 and PfalMre11. Second, we found that PfBLM expression was upregulated in response to DNA-damaging agents. Third, through yeast complementation studies, we demonstrated that PfBLM could complement the DNA damage sensitivity of a Deltasgs1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in contrast to the helicase-dead mutant PfblmK83R. Finally, we observe that the overexpression of PfBLM induces resistance to DNA-damaging agents and offers a survival advantage to the parasites. Most importantly, we found that the RecQ inhibitor ML216 inhibits the repair of DSBs and thereby renders parasites more sensitive to ART. Such synergism between ART and ML216 actions was observed for both drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant strains of P. falciparum. Taken together, these findings establish the implications of PfBlm in the Plasmodium DSB repair pathway and provide insights into the antiparasitic activity of the ART-ML216 combination. IMPORTANCE Malaria continues to be a serious threat to humankind not only because of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease but also due to the huge economic burden that it imparts. Resistance to all available drugs and the unavailability of an effective vaccine cry for an urgent discovery of newer drug targets. Here, we uncovered a role of the PfBlm helicase in Plasmodium DNA double-strand break repair and established that the parasitic DNA repair mechanism can be targeted to curb malaria. The small-molecule inhibitor of PfBlm tested in this study acts synergistically with two first-line malaria drugs, artemisinin (ART) and chloroquine, in both drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant strains of P. falciparum, thus qualifying this chemical as a potential partner in ART-based combination therapy. Additionally, the identification of this new specific inhibitor of the Plasmodium homologous recombination (HR) mechanism will now allow us to investigate the role of HR in Plasmodium biology.
33239369/Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal-Induced Outer Membrane Vesicles Enhance Biofilm Dispersion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Treatments that manipulate biofilm dispersion hold the potential to convert chronic drug-tolerant biofilm infections from protected sessile communities into released populations that are orders-of-magnitude more susceptible to antimicrobial treatment. However, dispersed cells often exhibit increased acute virulence and dissemination phenotypes. ABSTRACT Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to chronic infections in humans. Because they are recalcitrant to conventional therapy, they present a particularly difficult treatment challenge. Identifying factors involved in biofilm development can help uncover novel targets and guide the development of antibiofilm strategies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes surgical site, burn wound, and hospital-acquired infections and is also associated with aggressive biofilm formation in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. A potent but poorly understood contributor to P. aeruginosa virulence is the ability to produce outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMV trafficking has been associated with cell-cell communication, virulence factor delivery, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Because OMVs have almost exclusively been studied using planktonic cultures, little is known about their biogenesis and function in biofilms. Several groups have shown that Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) induces OMV formation in P. aeruginosa. Our group described a biophysical mechanism for this and recently showed it is operative in biofilms. Here, we demonstrate that PQS-induced OMV production is highly dynamic during biofilm development. Interestingly, PQS and OMV synthesis are significantly elevated during dispersion compared to attachment and maturation stages. PQS biosynthetic and receptor mutant biofilms were significantly impaired in their ability to disperse, but this phenotype was rescued by genetic complementation or exogenous addition of PQS. Finally, we show that purified OMVs can actively degrade extracellular protein, lipid, and DNA. We therefore propose that enhanced production of PQS-induced OMVs during biofilm dispersion facilitates cell escape by coordinating the controlled degradation of biofilm matrix components. IMPORTANCE Treatments that manipulate biofilm dispersion hold the potential to convert chronic drug-tolerant biofilm infections from protected sessile communities into released populations that are orders-of-magnitude more susceptible to antimicrobial treatment. However, dispersed cells often exhibit increased acute virulence and dissemination phenotypes. A thorough understanding of the dispersion process is therefore critical before this promising strategy can be effectively employed. Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) has been implicated in early biofilm development, but we hypothesized that its function as an outer membrane vesicle (OMV) inducer may contribute at multiple stages. Here, we demonstrate that PQS and OMVs are differentially produced during Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development and provide evidence that effective biofilm dispersion is dependent on the production of PQS-induced OMVs, which likely act as delivery vehicles for matrix-degrading enzymes. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding OMV contributions to biofilm development and suggest a model to explain the controlled matrix degradation that accompanies biofilm dispersion in many species.
33239108/Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic behavior of landiolol during dobutamine challenge in healthy adults Background To study the pharmacokinetic and -dynamic behavior of landiolol in the presence of dobutamine in healthy subjects of European ancestry. Methods We conducted a single-center, prospective randomized study in 16 healthy subjects each receiving an infusion of dobutamine sufficient to increase heart rate by 30 bpm followed by a 60 min infusion of 10 mug/kg/min landiolol. Results Dobutamine-induced increases in heart rate were stable for at least 20 min before a 60 min landiolol- infusion was started. The dobutamine effects were rapidly antagonized by landiolol within 16 min. A further slight decrease in heart rate during 20-60 min of the landiolol infusion occurred as well. Upon termination of landiolol infusion, heart rate and blood pressure recovered rapidly in response to the persisting dobutamine infusion but did not return to the maximum values before landiolol infusion. The pharmacokinetic parameters of landiolol in presence of dobutamine showed a short half-life (3.5 min) and a low distribution volume (0.3 l/kg). No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusion Landiolol can antagonize the dobutamine-induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure in a fast way. A rapid bradycardic effect until steady-state plasma levels is followed by a slow heart rate reduction. The latter can be attributed to an early desensitization to dobutamine. Consequently, after termination of landiolol, the heart rate did not achieve maximum pre-landiolol values. The pharmacokinetics of landiolol during dobutamine infusion are similar when compared to short- and long-term data in Caucasian subjects. Landiolol in the given dose can thus serve as an antagonist of dobutamine-induced cardiac effects. Trial registration Registration number 2010-023311-34 at the EU Clinical Trials Register, registration date 2010-12-21.
33114500/Hypothermia Advocates Functional Mitochondria and Alleviates Oxidative Stress to Combat Acetaminophen-Induced Hepatotoxicity For years, moderate hypothermia (32  C) has been proposed as an unorthodox therapy for liver injuries, with proven hepatoprotective potential. Yet, limited mechanistic understanding has largely denied its acceptance over conventional pharmaceuticals for hepatoprotection. Today, facing a high prevalence of acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI) which accounts for the highest incidence of acute liver failure, hypothermia was evaluated as a potential therapy to combat AILI. For which, transforming growth factor-alpha transgenic mouse hepatocytes (TAMH) were subjected to concomitant 5 mM acetaminophen toxicity and moderate hypothermic conditioning for 24 h. Thereafter, its impact on mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, glutathione homeostasis and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways were investigated. In the presence of AILI, hypothermia displayed simultaneous mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis to conserve functional mitochondria. Furthermore, antioxidant response was apparent with higher glutathione recycling and repressed JNK activation. These effects were, however, unremarkable with hypothermia alone without liver injury. This may suggest an adaptive response of hypothermia only to the injured sites, rendering it favorable as a potential targeted therapy. In fact, its cytoprotective effects were displayed in other DILI of similar pathology as acetaminophen i.e., valproate- and diclofenac-induced liver injury and this further corroborates the mechanistic findings of hypothermic actions on AILI.
33114738/ROS Overproduction Sensitises Myeloma Cells to Bortezomib-Induced Apoptosis and Alleviates Tumour Microenvironment-Mediated Cell Resistance Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm that remains incurable due to innate or acquired resistance. Although MM cells produce high intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesised that they could remain sensitive to ROS unbalance. We tested if the inhibition of ROS, on one hand, or the overproduction of ROS, on the other, could (re)sensitise cells to bortezomib (BTZ). Two drugs were used in a panel of MM cell lines with various responses to BTZ: VAS3947 (VAS), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase and auranofin (AUR), an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD1), an antioxidant enzyme overexpressed in MM cells. We used several culture models: in suspension, on a fibronectin layer, in coculture with HS-5 mesenchymal cells, and/or in 3-D culture (or spheroids) to study the response of MM primary cells and cell lines. Several MM cell lines were sensitive to VAS but the combination with BTZ showed antagonistic or additive effects at best. By contrast, in all culture systems studied, the combined AUR/BTZ treatment showed synergistic effects on cell lines, including those less sensitive to BTZ and primary cells. MM cell death is due to the activation of apoptosis and autophagy. Modulating the redox balance of MM cells could be an effective therapy for refractory or relapse post-BTZ patients.
33126443/Ameliorative Effect of Linalool in Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity: The Role of HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kappaB and Nrf2/HO1 Pathways Background: The monoterpene linalool is a well-known essential oil component produced by several aromatic plants. Cisplatin is a widely used anticancer drug that produces many side effects, particularly nephrotoxicity. Here, we aimed to inspect linalool's protective activity against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and explore part of the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Male Wistar rats were given linalool (50 and 100 mg/kg/day orally) for 15 days; then challenged with cisplatin (8 mg/kg) on the 12th day. Renal function parameters, oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic markers, and toll-like receptor pathway gene, and protein expressions were investigated. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and cell-line mediated cytotoxicity assays were conducted. Results: Linalool ameliorated kidney function after cisplatin challenge and managed all oxidation system parameters including GSH, SOD, CAT, MDA, NADPH, and particularly the Nrf2-mediated pathway markers. Linalool decreased TLR4, MYD88 and TRIF gene and protein expressions; diminished related inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and NF-kappaB; and down-regulated HMBG1. Linalool mitigated cisplatin-induced apoptotic markers such as caspase 3, caspase 9, and Bax expression, and boosted the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 expression. Linalool potentiated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin when investigated on HeLa and PC3 human cancer cell lines. Conclusion: Linalool could protect against cisplatin-induced kidney function and tissue damage. 
33113766/Protective Effects of Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) on Endometrial, Breast, and Ovarian Cancers Green tea and its major bioactive component, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), possess diverse biological properties, particularly antiproliferation, antimetastasis, and apoptosis induction. Many studies have widely investigated the anticancer and synergistic effects of EGCG due to the side effects of conventional cytotoxic agents. This review summarizes recent knowledge of underlying mechanisms of EGCG on protective roles for endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancers based on both in vitro and in vivo animal studies. EGCG has the ability to regulate many pathways, including the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and protection against epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EGCG has also been found to interact with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which affect epigenetic modifications. Finally, the action of EGCG may exert a suppressive effect on gynecological cancers and have beneficial effects on auxiliary therapies for known drugs. Thus, future clinical intervention studies with EGCG will be necessary to more and clear evidence for the benefit to these cancers.
33158278/Interaction between Polyphenolic Antioxidants and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells Defective in Heavy Metal Transport across the Plasma Membrane Natural polyphenols are compounds with important biological implications which include antioxidant and metal-chelating characteristics relevant for their antimicrobial, antitumor, or antiaging potential. The mechanisms linking polyphenols and heavy metals in their concerted actions on cells are not completely elucidated. In this study, we used the model eukaryotic microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to detect the action of widely prevalent natural polyphenols on yeast cells defective in the main components involved in essential heavy metal transport across the plasma membrane. We found that caffeic and gallic acids interfered with Zn accumulation, causing delays in cell growth that were alleviated by Zn supplementation. The flavones morin and quercetin interfered with both Mn and Zn accumulation, which resulted in growth improvement, but supplemental Mn and especially Zn turned the initially benefic action of morin and quercetin into potential toxicity. Our results imply that caution is needed when administering food supplements or nutraceuticals which contain both natural polyphenols and essential elements, especially zinc.
33167484/Co-Application of Eugenol and QX-314 Elicits the Prolonged Blockade of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels in Nociceptive Trigeminal Ganglion Neurons Local anesthetics (LAs) can completely block nociception by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), and thus, blocking action potentials (APs) within sensory neurons. As one of the several LAs, eugenol is used for dental pain treatment. It reportedly features multiple functions in regulating diverse ion channels. This study aimed to investigate the long-lasting analgesic effect of eugenol alone, as well as that of the combination of eugenol as a noxious-heat-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel agonist and a permanently charged sodium channel blocker (QX-314), on neuronal excitability in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. Eugenol alone increased inward current in a dose-dependent manner in capsaicin-sensitive TG neurons. Eugenol also inhibited the VGSC current and AP. These effects were reversed through wash-out. The combination of eugenol and QX-314 was evaluated in the same manner. The combination completely inhibited the VGSC current and AP. However, these effects were not reversed and were continuously blocked even after wash-out. Taken together, our results suggest that, in contrast to the effect of eugenol alone, the combination of eugenol and QX-314 irreversibly and selectively blocked VGSCs in TG neurons expressing TRPV1.
33171918/Effect of Mild Salinity Stress on the Growth, Fatty Acid and Carotenoid Compositions, and Biological Activities of the Thermal Freshwater Microalgae Scenedesmus sp. Carotenoids have strong antioxidant activity as well as therapeutic value. Their production has been induced in algae under stressful culture conditions. However, the extreme culture conditions lead to the Programmed Cell Death (PCD) of algae, which affects their growth and productivity. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of salinity on the physiological and biochemical traits of Scenedesmus sp., thermal freshwater microalgae from Northern Tunisia. It was cultured under different NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 g/L. Results showed a good growth and high contents of total chlorophyll and carotenoids in Scenedesmus sp. cultured at 10 g/L of NaCl (salt-stressed 10 (Ss10)). The pigment composition of the Ss10 extract was acquired using HPLC-MS, and showed that the carotenoid fraction is particularly rich in xanthophylls. Moreover, the antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP) and enzymatic inhibition (tyrosinase and elastase) activities of the Ss10 extract were higher compared to those of the control culture. In addition, the cytotoxicity test on B16 cells showed that the Ss10 extract was non-toxic for all tested concentrations below 100 microg/mL. It also showed a rich unsaturated fatty acid (FA) composition. Therefore, these findings suggest that Scenedesmus sp. strain cultivated under mild stress salinity could be a source of biomolecules that have potential applications in the nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries.
33172035/Ellagic Acid Prevents Dopamine Neuron Degeneration from Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation in MPTP Model of Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and is characterized by progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta area. In the present study, treatment of EA for 1 week at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight prior to MPTP (25 mg/kg body weight) was carried out. MPTP administration caused oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and the depletion of reduced glutathione with a concomitant rise in the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde. It also significantly increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines and elevated the inflammatory mediators like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the striatum. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a loss of dopamine neurons in the SNc area and a decrease in dopamine transporter in the striatum following MPTP administration. However, treatment with EA prior to MPTP injection significantly rescued the dopaminergic neurons and dopamine transporter. EA treatment further restored antioxidant enzymes, prevented the depletion of glutathione and inhibited lipid peroxidation, in addition to the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EA also reduced the levels of COX-2 and iNOS. The findings of the present study demonstrate that EA protects against MPTP-induced PD and the observed neuroprotective effects can be attributed to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
33182753/Magnoflorine:Isolation and the Anticancer Potential against NCI-H1299 Lung, MDA-MB-468 Breast, T98G Glioma, and TE671 Rhabdomyosarcoma Cancer Cells Magnoflorine (MGN) is a quaternary aporphine alkaloid that exhibits numerous therapeutic properties, including neuropsychopharmacological, anti-anxiety, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or antifungal activities. The aim of the present study was an investigation of the influence of MGN on viability, proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in NCI-H1299 lung, MDA-MB-468 breast, T98G glioma, and TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cancer cells. MGN was isolated from the roots of Berberis cretica L. by counter-current partition chromatography (CPC). Cell viability and proliferation assessments were performed by means of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrDU) assays, respectively. The induction of apoptosis and cell cycle progression was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. MGN in high doses inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and inhibits cell cycle in S/G2 phases in a dose-dependent manner. MGN seems to be a promising anti-cancer compound in therapy of some types of lung, breast, glioma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cancers, for which current standard therapies are limited or have severe strong side effects.
33202661/Autophagy Stimulus-Dependent Role of the Small GTPase Ras2 in Peroxisome Degradation The changing accessibility of nutrient resources induces the reprogramming of cellular metabolism in order to adapt the cell to the altered growth conditions. The nutrient-depending signaling depends on the kinases mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), which is mainly activated by nitrogen-resources, and PKA (protein kinase A), which is mainly activated by glucose, as well as both of their associated factors. These systems promote protein synthesis and cell proliferation, while they inhibit degradation of cellular content by unselective bulk autophagy. Much less is known about their role in selective autophagy pathways, which have a more regulated cellular function. Especially, we were interested to analyse the central Ras2-module of the PKA-pathway in the context of peroxisome degradation. Yeast Ras2 is homologous to the mammalian Ras proteins, whose mutant forms are responsible for 33% of human cancers. In the present study, we were able to demonstrate a context-dependent role of Ras2 activity depending on the type of mTOR-inhibition and glucose-sensing situation. When mTOR was inhibited directly via the macrolide rapamycin, peroxisome degradation was still partially suppressed by Ras2, while inactivation of Ras2 resulted in an enhanced degradation of peroxisomes, suggesting a role of Ras2 in the inhibition of peroxisome degradation in glucose-grown cells. In contrast, the inhibition of mTOR by shifting cells from oleate-medium, which lacks glucose, to pexophagy-medium, which contains glucose and is limited in nitrogen, required Ras2-activity for efficient pexophagy, strongly suggesting that the role of Ras2 in glucose sensing-associated signaling is more important in this context than its co-function in mTOR-related autophagy-inhibition.
33182454/Neuroprotective Effects of Methyl Caffeate against Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Cell Damage: Involvement of Caspase 3 and Cathepsin D Inhibition Finding effective neuroprotective strategies to combat various neurodegenerative disorders still remain a clinically unmet need. Methyl caffeate (MC), a naturally occurring ester of caffeic acid, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities; however, its role in neuroprotection is less investigated. In order to better characterize neuroprotective properties of MC, we tested its effectiveness in various models of neuronal cell injury in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in mouse primary neuronal cell cultures. MC at micromolar concentrations attenuated neuronal cell damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in undifferentiated and neuronal differentiated SH-SY5Y cells as well as in primary cortical neurons. This effect was associated with inhibition of both caspase-3 and cathepsin D but without involvement of the PI3-K/Akt pathway. MC was neuroprotective when given before and during but not after the induction of cell damage by H2O2. Moreover, MC was protective against 6-OHDA-evoked neurotoxicity in neuronal differentiated SH-SY5Y cells via inhibition of necrotic and apoptotic processes. On the other hand, MC was ineffective in models of excitotoxicity (induced by glutamate or oxygen-glucose deprivation) and even moderately augmented cytotoxic effects of the classical apoptotic inducer, staurosporine. Finally, in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells MC at higher concentrations (above 50 microM) induced cell death and when combined with the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, it increased the cell damaging effects of the latter compound. Thus, neuroprotective properties of MC appear to be limited to certain models of neurotoxicity and depend on its concentrations and time of administration. 
33187226/AAPH or Peroxynitrite-Induced Biorelevant Oxidation of Methyl Caffeate Yields a Potent Antitumor Metabolite Hydroxycinnamic acids represent a versatile group of dietary plant antioxidants. Oxidation of methyl-p-coumarate (pcm) and methyl caffeate (cm) was previously found to yield potent antitumor metabolites. Here, we report the formation of potentially bioactive products of pcm and cm oxidized with peroxynitrite (ONOO ), a biologically relevant reactive nitrogen species (RNS), or with alpha,alpha'-azodiisobutyramidine dihydrochloride (AAPH) as a chemical model for reactive oxygen species (ROS). A continuous flow system was developed to achieve reproducible in situ ONOO  formation. Reaction mixtures were tested for their cytotoxic effect on HeLa, SiHa, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The reaction of pcm with ONOO  produced two fragments, an o-nitrophenol derivative, and a new chlorinated compound. Bioactivity-guided isolation from the reaction mixture of cm with AAPH produced two dimerization products, including a dihydrobenzofuran lignan that exerted strong antitumor activity in vitro, and has potent in vivo antimetastatic activity which was previously reported. This compound was also detected from the reaction between cm and ONOO . Our results demonstrate the ROS/RNS dependent formation of chemically stable metabolites, including a potent antitumor agent (5), from hydroxycinnamic acids. This suggests that diversity-oriented synthesis using ROS/RNS to obtain oxidized antioxidant metabolite mixtures may serve as a valid natural product-based drug discovery strategy.
33198243/Mitochondrial Carriers Regulating Insulin Secretion Profiled in Human Islets upon Metabolic Stress Chronic exposure of beta-cells to nutrient-rich metabolic stress impairs mitochondrial metabolism and its coupling to insulin secretion. We exposed isolated human islets to different metabolic stresses for 3 days: 0.4 mM oleate or 0.4 mM palmitate at physiological 5.5 mM glucose (lipotoxicity), high 25 mM glucose (glucotoxicity), and high 25 mM glucose combined with 0.4 mM oleate and/or palmitate (glucolipotoxicity). Then, we profiled the mitochondrial carriers and associated genes with RNA-Seq. Diabetogenic conditions, and in particular glucotoxicity, increased expression of several mitochondrial solute carriers in human islets, such as the malate carrier DIC, the alpha-ketoglutarate-malate exchanger OGC, and the glutamate carrier GC1. Glucotoxicity also induced a general upregulation of the electron transport chain machinery, while palmitate largely counteracted this effect. Expression of different components of the TOM/TIM mitochondrial protein import system was increased by glucotoxicity, whereas glucolipotoxicity strongly upregulated its receptor subunit TOM70. Expression of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU was essentially preserved by metabolic stresses. However, glucotoxicity altered expression of regulatory elements of calcium influx as well as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX, which mediates calcium efflux. Overall, the expression profile of mitochondrial carriers and associated genes was modified by the different metabolic stresses exhibiting nutrient-specific signatures.
33202956/Glutathione Enhances Auxin Sensitivity in Arabidopsis Roots Root development is regulated by the tripeptide glutathione (GSH), a strong non-enzymatic antioxidant found in plants but with a poorly understood function in roots. Here, Arabidopsis mutants deficient in GSH biosynthesis (cad2, rax1, and rml1) and plants treated with the GSH biosynthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) showed root growth inhibition, significant alterations in the root apical meristem (RAM) structure (length and cell division), and defects in lateral root formation. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of GSH action showed that GSH deficiency modulated total ubiquitination of proteins and inhibited the auxin-related, ubiquitination-dependent degradation of Aux/IAA proteins and the transcriptional activation of early auxin-responsive genes. However, the DR5 auxin transcriptional response differed in root apical meristem (RAM) and pericycle cells. The RAM DR5 signal was increased due to the up-regulation of the auxin biosynthesis TAA1 protein and down-regulation of PIN4 and PIN2, which can act as auxin sinks in the root tip. The transcription auxin response (the DR5 signal and expression of auxin responsive genes) in isolated roots, induced by a low (0.1 microM) auxin concentration, was blocked following GSH depletion of the roots by BSO treatment. A higher auxin concentration (0.5 microM) offset this GSH deficiency effect on DR5 expression, indicating that GSH deficiency does not completely block the transcriptional auxin response, but decreases its sensitivity. The ROS regulation of GSH, the active GSH role in cell proliferation, and GSH cross-talk with auxin assume a potential role for GSH in the modulation of root architecture under stress conditions. 
33198360/Identification of Functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Porcine HSD17B14 Gene Associated with Estrus Behavior Difference between Large White and Mi Gilts Steroid hormone levels are associated with estrous behavior, which affects timely mating and reproductive efficiency in pigs. 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 14 (HSD17B14) modulates steroid synthesis and metabolism. To identify the functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the porcine HSD17B14 gene, ear tissues from Large White and Mi gilts were collected to extract genomic DNA. Variable lengths of truncated promoter of HSD17B14 gene were used to determine the promoter activity by a dual luciferase reporter system. The vector HSD17B14Phe or HSD17B14Val was transfected into porcine granulosa cells (GCs). The core promoter region was identified between -72 bp and -218 bp. Six of seven SNPs had significant differences of allele frequency between Large White and Mi gilts. The plasmids with the wild genotype AA of rs329427898 maintained a smaller fraction of promoter activity compared with the plasmids with the mutant genotype GG, while the plasmids with wild the genotype TT of rs319864566 had a greater promoter activity than the plasmids with the mutant genotype CC. A missense mutation (Phe73Val) caused changes in the structural dynamics and function of the HSD17B14 protein. The highly expressed HSD17B14Val degraded less estradiol into estrone, while the relatively lowly expressed HSD17B14Phe degraded more estradiol into estrone, suggesting the protein activity of HSD17B14Phe was greater than that of HSD17B14Val. Moreover, the HSD17B14Phe group has a greater apoptosis rate of porcine GCs. The HSD17B14 gene could been used as a candidate molecular marker for estrus behavior in pigs.
33187273/Mapping the Inorganic and Proteomic Differences among Different Types of Human Teeth: A Preliminary Compositional Insight In recent years, studies on mineralized tissues are becoming increasingly popular not only due to the diverse mechanophysical properties of such materials but also because of the growing need to understand the intricate mechanism involved in their assembly and formation. The biochemical mechanism that results in the formation of such hierarchical structures through a well-coordinated accumulation of inorganic and organic components is termed biomineralization. Some prime examples of such tissues in the human body are teeth and bones. Our current study is an attempt to dissect the compositional details of the inorganic and organic components in four major types of human teeth using mass spectrometry-based approaches. We quantified inorganic materials using inductively coupled plasma resonance mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Differential level of ten different elements, Iron (Fe), Cadmium (Cd), Potassium (K), Sulphur (S), Cobalt (Co), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Aluminum (Al), and Copper (Cu) were quantified across different teeth types. The qualitative and quantitative details of their respective proteomic milieu revealed compositional differences. We found 152 proteins in total tooth protein extract. Differential abundance of proteins in different teeth types were also noted. Further, we were able to find out some significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) backbone through the STRING database. Since this is the first study analyzing the differential details of inorganic and organic counterparts within teeth, this report will pave new directions to the compositional understanding and development of novel in-vitro repair strategies for such biological materials.
33203123/Potential Nutraceutical Properties of Leaves from Several Commonly Cultivated Plants Chronic dietary ingestion of suitable phytochemicals may assist with limiting or negating neurodegenerative decline. Current therapeutics used to treat Alzheimer disease elicit broad adverse drug reactions, and alternative sources of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are required. Herein, we screened methanolic extracts from seven commonly cultivated plants for their nutraceutical potential; ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE), and provision of antioxidant activity through their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging capabilities. Potential neurotoxicity of plant extracts was examined via application to SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells and quantitation of cell viability. Methanolic extracts of Citrus limon (Lemon), Bombax ceiba (Red silk-cotton), Lawsonia inermis (Henna), Eucalyptus globulus (Eucalyptus), Ocimum basilicum (Basil), Citrus reticulata (Mandarin orange), and Mentha spicata (Spearmint) all displayed concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE and BuChE. The majority of extracts inhibited AChE and BuChE to near equipotency, with Henna and Eucalyptus extracts the two most potent ChEIs. All plant extracts were able to scavenge free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner, with Eucalyptus the most potent antioxidant. Toxicity of plant extracts to neuronal cells was concentration dependent, with Eucalyptus also the most toxic extract. Fractionation of plant extracts and analysis by mass spectrometry identified a number of plant polyphenols that might have contributed to the cholinesterase inhibition: 3-caffeoylquinic acid, methyl 4-caffeoylquinate, kaempferol-acetyl-glycoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin-acetyl-glycoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-glucoside. In silico molecular modeling of these polyphenols demonstrated their improved AChE and BuChE binding affinities compared to the current FDA-approved dual ChEI, galantamine. Collectively, all the plant extracts contained nutraceutical agents as antioxidants and ChEIs and, therefore, their chronic consumption may prove beneficial to combat the pathological deficits that accrue in Alzheimer disease.
33227978/Study of Morphological Features and Determination of the Fatty Acid Composition of the Microalgae Lipid Complex Microalgae are rich in nutrients and biologically active substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, pigments, phycobiliproteins, among others. The lipid composition of the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris, Arthrospira platensis, and Dunaliella salina was screened for the first time. The proposed method for purifying the lipid complex isolated from microalgae's biomass involved dissolving the lipid-pigment complex in n-hexane for 4 h and stirring at 500 rpm. We found that the largest number of neutral lipids is contained in the biomass of microalgae Arthrospira platensis, fatty acids, polar lipids (glycerophospholipids), and unsaponifiable substances:in the biomass of microalgae Dunaliella salina, chlorophyll, and other impurities:in the biomass of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. The developed method of purification of the fatty acid composition of the microalgae lipid complex confirmed the content of fatty acids in microalgae, which are of interest for practical use in the production of biologically active components. We also determined the potential of its use in the development of affordable technology for processing microalgae into valuable food and feed additives.
33228017/SGLT2 Inhibition by Intraperitoneal Dapagliflozin Mitigates Peritoneal Fibrosis and Ultrafiltration Failure in a Mouse Model of Chronic Peritoneal Exposure to High-Glucose Dialysate Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is limited by glucose-mediated peritoneal membrane (PM) fibrosis, angiogenesis, and ultrafiltration failure. Influencing PM integrity by pharmacologically targeting sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT)-mediated glucose uptake has not been studied. In this study, wildtype C57Bl/6N mice were treated with high-glucose dialysate via an intraperitoneal catheter, with or without addition of selective SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. PM structural changes, ultrafiltration capacity, and peritoneal equilibration testing (PET) status for glucose, urea, and creatinine were analyzed. Expression of SGLT and facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT) was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Peritoneal effluents were analyzed for cellular and cytokine composition. We found that peritoneal SGLT2 was expressed in mesothelial cells and in skeletal muscle. Dapagliflozin significantly reduced effluent transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) concentrations, peritoneal thickening, and fibrosis, as well as microvessel density, resulting in improved ultrafiltration, despite the fact that it did not affect development of high-glucose transporter status. In vitro, dapagliflozin reduced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 release under high-glucose conditions in human and murine peritoneal mesothelial cells. Proinflammatory cytokine release in macrophages was reduced only when cultured in high-glucose conditions with an additional inflammatory stimulus. In summary, dapagliflozin improved structural and functional peritoneal health in the context of high-glucose PD.
33228230/Polyphenol Extract from Evening Primrose (Oenothera paradoxa) Inhibits Invasion Properties of Human Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Cells Extracts from the defatted evening primrose (Oenothera paradoxa Hudziok) seeds are the source of a range of stable polyphenolic compounds, including ellagic acid, gallic acid, and catechin. Our studies evaluate, for the first time, the influence of evening primrose isopropanol extract (EPE) on malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells. MPM is rarely diagnosed, its high aggressiveness and frequently noted chemoresistance limit its treatment schemes and it is characterized by low prognostic features. Here, we demonstrate that EPE inhibited MPM growth in a dose-dependent manner in cells with increased invasion properties. Moreover, EPE treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and increased apoptosis in invasive MPM cell lines. Additionally, EPE strongly limited invasion and MMP-7 secretion in MPM cancer cells. Our original data provide evidence about the potential anti-invasive effects of EPE in MPM therapy treatment.
33228239/Cannabidiol: A Potential New Alternative for the Treatment of Anxiety, Depression, and Psychotic Disorders The potential therapeutic use of some Cannabis sativa plant compounds has been attracting great interest, especially for managing neuropsychiatric disorders due to the relative lack of efficacy of the current treatments. Numerous studies have been carried out using the main phytocannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). CBD displays an interesting pharmacological profile without the potential for becoming a drug of abuse, unlike THC. In this review, we focused on the anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antipsychotic effects of CBD found in animal and human studies. In rodents, results suggest that the effects of CBD depend on the dose, the strain, the administration time course (acute vs. chronic), and the route of administration. In addition, certain key targets have been related with these CBD pharmacological actions, including cannabinoid receptors (CB1r and CB2r), 5-HT1A receptor and neurogenesis factors. Preliminary clinical trials also support the efficacy of CBD as an anxiolytic, antipsychotic, and antidepressant, and more importantly, a positive risk-benefit profile. These promising results support the development of large-scale studies to further evaluate CBD as a potential new drug for the treatment of these psychiatric disorders.
33233373/Molybdenum Supply Alleviates the Cadmium Toxicity in Fragrant Rice by Modulating Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Gene Expression Increasing evidence shows that cadmium (Cd) toxicity causes severe perturbations on growth performance, physio-biochemical and molecular processes in crop plants. Molybdenum (Mo), an essential trace element, plays key roles in oxidative stress tolerance of higher plants. Hence, the present study has been conducted to investigate the possible role of Mo in alleviating Cd-induced inhibitions in two fragrant rice cultivars namely Guixiangzhan (GXZ) and Meixiangzhan-2 (MXZ-2). The results revealed that Mo application enhanced the plant dry biomass by 73.24% in GXZ and 58.09% in MXZ-2 under Cd stress conditions, suggesting that Mo supplementation alleviated Cd-induced toxicity effects in fragrant rice. The enhanced Cd-tolerance in fragrant rice plants prompted by Mo application could be ascribed to its ability to regulate Cd uptake and reduce Cd-induced oxidative stress as evident by lower hydrogen peroxide levels, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde contents in Cd-stressed plants. The ameliorative role of Mo against Cd-toxicity also reflected through its protection to the photosynthetic pigments, proline and soluble protein. Mo also induced antioxidant defense systems via maintaining higher contents of glutathione and ascorbate as well as enhancing the ROS-detoxifying enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities and up-regulating transcript abundance in both fragrant rice cultivars under Cd stress. Conclusively, Mo-mediated modulation of Cd toxicity in fragrant rice was through restricting Cd uptake, maintaining photosynthetic performance and alleviating oxidative damages via the strong anti-oxidative defense systems; however, GXZ cultivar is comparatively more Cd tolerant and Mo-efficient as evident from the less growth inhibition and biomass reduction as well as enhanced Mo-induced Cd stress tolerance and less oxidative damage than MXZ-2 fragrant rice cultivar.
33234685/Effects of Agricultural Fungicide Use on Aspergillus fumigatus Abundance, Antifungal Susceptibility, and Population Structure Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat to human health. In the case of Aspergillus fumigatus, which is an environmental fungus that also causes life-threatening infections in humans, antimicrobial resistance is suggested to arise from fungicide use in agriculture, as the chemicals used for plant protection are almost identical to the antifungals used clinically. However, removing azole fungicides from crop fields threatens the global food supply via a reduction in yield. In this study, we survey crop fields before and after fungicide application. We find a low overall azole resistance rate among agricultural isolates, as well as a lack of genomic and population impact following fungicide application, leading us to conclude azole use on crops does not significantly contribute to resistance in A. fumigatus. ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat to human health. In the case of Aspergillus fumigatus, which is both an environmental saprobe and an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, resistance is suggested to arise from fungicide use in agriculture, as the azoles used for plant protection share the same molecular target as the frontline antifungals used clinically. However, limiting azole fungicide use on crop fields to preserve their activity for clinical use could threaten the global food supply via a reduction in yield. In this study, we clarify the link between azole fungicide use on crop fields and resistance in a prototypical human pathogen through systematic soil sampling on farms in Germany and surveying fields before and after fungicide application. We observed a reduction in the abundance of A. fumigatus on fields following fungicide treatment in 2017, a finding that was not observed on an organic control field with only natural plant protection agents applied. However, this finding was less pronounced during our 2018 sampling, indicating that the impact of fungicides on A. fumigatus population size is variable and influenced by additional factors. The overall resistance frequency among agricultural isolates is low, with only 1 to 3% of isolates from 2016 to 2018 displaying resistance to medical azoles. Isolates collected after the growing season and azole exposure show a subtle but consistent decrease in susceptibility to medical and agricultural azoles. Whole-genome sequencing indicates that, despite the alterations in antifungal susceptibility, fungicide application does not significantly affect the population structure and genetic diversity of A. fumigatus in fields. Given the low observed resistance rate among agricultural isolates as well the lack of genomic impact following azole application, we do not find evidence that azole use on crops is significantly driving resistance in A. fumigatus in this context.
33234686/Heterotrimeric G-Protein Signaling Is Required for Cellulose Degradation in Neurospora crassa Filamentous fungi are critical for the recycling of plant litter in the biosphere by degrading lignocellulosic biomass into simpler compounds for metabolism. Both saprophytic and pathogenic fungi utilize plant cell wall-degrading enzymes to liberate carbon for metabolism. Several studies have demonstrated a role for cellulase enzymes during infection of economically relevant crops by fungal pathogens. Especially in developing countries, severe plant disease means loss of entire crops, sometimes leading to starvation. In this study, we demonstrate that G-protein signaling is a key component of cellulase production. Therefore, understanding the role of G-protein signaling in the regulation of the unique metabolism of cellulose by these organisms can inform innovations in strain engineering of industrially relevant species for biofuel production and in combatting food shortages caused by plant pathogens. ABSTRACT The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa decomposes lignocellulosic biomass to generate soluble sugars as carbon sources. In this study, we investigated a role for heterotrimeric G-protein signaling in cellulose degradation. Loss of the Galpha subunit genes gna-1 and gna-3, the Gbeta subunit genes gnb-1 and cpc-2, the Ggamma gene gng-1, or the gene for downstream effector adenylyl cyclase (cr-1) resulted in loss of detectable cellulase activity. This defect was also observed in strains expressing a constitutively active version of gna-3 (gna-3Q208L). We found that GNA-1 levels are greatly reduced in Deltagna-3, Deltagnb-1, and Deltagng-1 strains, likely contributing to cellulase defects in these genetic backgrounds. The observation that gna-3Q208L Deltagnb-1 strains exhibit cellulase activity, despite greatly reduced levels of GNA-1 protein, is consistent with positive control of cellulase production by GNA-3 that is manifested in the absence of gnb-1. Expression patterns for five cellulase genes showed that Deltagna-1, Deltagnb-1, and Deltagna-3 mutants produce less cellulase mRNA than the wild type, consistent with transcriptional regulation. Deltacpc-2 mutants had wild-type levels of cellulase transcripts, suggesting posttranscriptional control. In contrast, results for Deltacr-1 mutants support both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of cellulase activity by cAMP signaling. Cellulase activity defects in Deltagna-3 mutants were fully remediated by cAMP supplementation, consistent with GNA-3 operating upstream of cAMP signaling. In contrast, cAMP addition only partially corrected cellulase activity defects in Deltagna-1 and Deltagnb-1 mutants, suggesting participation of GNA-1 and GNB-1 in additional cAMP-independent pathways that control cellulase activity.
33256621/Randomized clinical trial to compare efficacy and safety of repeated courses of rituximab to single-course rituximab followed by maintenance mycophenolate-mofetil in children with steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome Background Approximately 30% of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome develop a complicated course with frequent relapses or steroid dependency. Rituximab, a B cell depleting monoclonal antibody, is a safe and effective alternative to steroids or other immunosuppressants for achieving and maintaining remission in this population at short term. Despite the good initial response relapses inevitably occur after regeneration of B lymphocytes, necessitating either repeat courses of rituximab or addition of another steroid-sparing immunosuppressant. Methods This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, two-parallel-arm randomized controlled phase III study among children with steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome who are maintained in remission with oral steroids. One hundred children will be randomized to either Rituximab and maintenance Mycophenolate mofetil (A) or repeated courses of prophylactic Rituximab only (B). In arm A, mycophenolate mofetil (1200 mg/m2 per day) will be started 3 months after Rituximab administration. In arm B, Rituximab infusions will be administered at 0, 8 and 16 months if B cell count normalize at the given time points. Prednisolone will be discontinued in both groups 2 weeks following first course of rituximab. Primary aim is to evaluate the difference in 24-month relapse-free survival. Main secondary endpoints are cumulative prednisolone dose, frequency of relapses and changes in anthropometry. Circulating B lymphocyte populations will be studied as biomarkers or predictors of rituximab responsiveness and adverse events will be analysed. Discussion The study will provide evidence as to the comparative safety and efficacy of two alternative steroid-sparing therapeutic options in children suffering from steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome. The two-year study design will address the long-term results obtained with the alternative treatment protocols. Trial registration This trial was prospectively registered to the Clinicaltrial.gov (NCT03899103 dated 02/04/2019; https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2019/04/018517 dated 09/04/2019).
33261642/The effects of alpha lipoic acid on muscle strength recovery after a single and a short-term chronic supplementation - a study in healthy well-trained individuals after intensive resistance and endurance training Background Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activity and was tested as a drug for the treatment of various diseases. ALA is also frequently used as a nutrition supplement, in healthy individuals or in competitive athletes. However, information from intervention studies investigating physiological effects of an ALA in athletes after exercise is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of single and short-term chronic ALA supplementation on the muscle strength recovery and performance of athletes after intensive exercise. Methods In a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial in cross-over design, 17 male resistance and endurance-experienced athletes successfully participated. The subjects were divided into two groups (ALA and Placebo) and underwent a standardized single training session and a high intense training week. At certain time points (T0, T1a (+ 3 h), T1b (+ 24 h) and T2 (+7d)) blood samples were taken and markers for muscle damage, inflammation and oxidative stress were investigated. In addition, the maximum performance in the back squat was measured at all time points. Results In the chronic training experiment, a moderate inhibition of muscle damage and inflammation could be observed in the ALA-group. Performance in the back squat was significantly reduced in the placebo-group, but not in the ALA-group. No anti-oxidative effects could be observed. Conclusions Our data indicate possible effects of ALA supplementation, during intensive training periods result in a reduction of muscle damage, inflammation and an increase of recovery. Whether ALA supplementation in general may enhance performance and the exact training / supplementation scenarios needs to be investigated in future studies.

33256618/Prevalence of malnutrition inflammation complex syndrome among patients on maintenance haemodialysis at Muhimbili National Hospital in Tanzania: a cross-sectional study Background Malnutrition, inflammation, and the combination thereof are predictors of poor outcomes in haemodialysis patients. Malnutrition Inflammation Complex Syndrome (MICS) is an accelerator of atherosclerosis and portends high mortality. Early recognition and treatment of MICS may help to improve the clinical outlook of such patients. This study investigated the prevalence of MICS and its associated factors among patients on maintenance haemodialysis at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional observational study done among 160 adult patients on maintenance haemodialysis at MNH in 2019. All participants provided written informed consent. Questionnaires were used to collect data and patients' blood was tested for complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, transferrin, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, and albumin. The Malnutrition Inflammation Score was used to assess MICS and its severity. Data analysis was done using the SPSS 20 software. Results Of the 160 patients included in the study, 111 (69.4%) were male. The mean age (+-SD) of patients and mean duration (+-SD) on haemodialysis were 52.2(13.3) years and 22(18) months respectively. MICS was prevalent in 46.3% (mild in 24.4% and moderate to severe in 21.9%). Long-term haemodialysis (> 4 years) was an independent predictor of MICS [Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR 5.04 (95% CI: 1.33-19.2), p < 0.05]. Hypercholesterolaemia was a negative predictor of MICS [AOR 0.11 (95% CI: 0.01-0.97), p < 0.05]. Patients with MICS had significantly lower mean body mass index, serum albumin, total cholesterol, transferrin, haemoglobin, and creatinine levels. The presence of MICS was higher in underweight patients and those who had inflammation. Haemodialysis adequacy did not correlate with MICS. Conclusion Malnutrition Inflammation Complex Syndrome is relatively common among patients on haemodialysis in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Our study has shown a longer duration on haemodialysis to be associated with the occurrence of MICS; on the contrary, having hypercholesterolaemia seems to be protective against MICS consistent with the concept of reverse epidemiology. Patients on haemodialysis should be assessed regularly for malnutrition and inflammation and should receive appropriate and timely treatment to reduce the burden of associated morbidity, and mortality to these patients.
33256752/Clinical syndromes and treatment location predict utility of carbapenem sparing therapies in ceftriaxone-non-susceptibleEscherichia colibloodstream infection Background Cefiderocol, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, intravenous fosfomycin and plazomicin represent potential carbapenem sparing agents for extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase or AmpC beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli infection. However, available data is limited in predicting the volume of carbapenem therapy which could be substituted and real-world contraindications. Methods We determined the number of carbapenem days of therapy (DOT) which could be substituted and frequent contraindications accounting for antimicrobial susceptibility and site of infection in an unselected cohort with ceftriaxone-non-susceptible E. coli bacteremia at a single health network from 2015 to 2016. Individual patient data was used to calculate DOT and substitution for each agent. Results There were 108 episodes of E. coli bacteremia resulting in 67.2 carbapenem DOT/100 patient-days of antimicrobial therapy administered. Ceftazidime-avibactam could be used to substitute 36.2 DOT/100 patient-days (54%) for inpatient definitive therapy, ceftolozane-tazobactam for 34.7 DOT/100 patient-days (52%), cefiderocol for 27.1 DOT/100 patient-days (40%), fosfomycin for 23.3 DOT /100 patient-days (35%) and plazomicin for 27.1 DOT/100 patient-days (40%). Non-urinary tract source of infection was the most frequent contraindication to fosfomycin (25), plazomicin (26) and cefiderocol (26). Use in outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) programs accounted for 40% of DOT, all of which could be substituted if stability data allowed for ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam. Conclusions All tested agents could be used to replace a significant volume of carbapenem therapy. Establishing stability of these agents for use in OPAT is required for maximizing their use as carbapenem sparing agents while randomized clinical data is awaited for some of these agents in resistant E. coli bacteremia.
33256848/Presentations of tetramethylammonium hydroxide dermal exposure and the valuable potential of diphoterine solution in decontamination: a retrospective observational study Background Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is a quaternary ammonium compound that is both a base corrosive and a cholinergic agonist, and it is widely used in the photoelectric and semiconductor industries. It causes corrosive skin injuries and systemic cholinergic toxicity with death primarily resulting from respiratory failure without efficacious early decontamination. Methods A retrospective observational study was performed of all cases of TMAH exposure reported to the Taiwan Poison Control Center between July 2010 and October 2017. Retrieved medical records were independently reviewed by two trained clinical toxicologists. Results Despite immediate (< 5 min) skin decontamination with copious amounts of tap water, one patient exposed to 25% TMAH involving >=5% of total body surface area (TBSA) developed significant systemic toxicity. Patients exposed to 25% TMAH involving <=1% TBSA developed first-degree chemical skin injuries but no systemic toxicity. Among patients exposed to lower concentrations (<=2.38%) of TMAH, the majority only experienced first-degree chemical skin injuries without systemic signs. Patients exposed to 0.5% TMAH involving nearly their entire TBSA developed no chemical skin injuries or systemic toxicity. All patients who had only first-degree chemical skin injuries did not develop systemic toxicity after exposure to either 2.38% or 25% TMAH. Conclusions TMAH acts as an alkaline corrosive and cholinergic agonist. Systemic signs attributable to TMA+ can rapidly lead to respiratory failure and death after dermal exposure. We have demonstrated that an amphoteric solution may be efficacious for skin decontamination on-site immediately to prevent or ameliorate such toxicity. This practice especially carries a valuable potential in managing victims (patients) who have been exposed to those chemicals with immediate life-threatening toxicity (e.g. TMAH), suggesting that its early utilization deserves further study.
33267901/Nebivolol combined with tetrahydrobiopterin affects diastolic function in spontaneously hypertensive rats via the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signalling pathway Background Hypertension is the the primary cause of diastolic heart failure. Oxidative stress plays an important role in cardiac diastolic dysfunction caused by hypertension. The occurrence of oxidative stress is related to the level of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for NO synthesis. Nebivolol can reduce myocardial oxidative stress and increase NO activity. Therefore, we investigated the effects of monotherapy or combination therapy of different doses of BH4 and nebivolol on cardiac diastolic function in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and preliminarily expounded the related mechanisms. Methods Left ventricular function was evaluated by non-invasive echocardiographic assessment and invasive right carotid artery catheterization methods. ELISA was used to measure myocardial 3-nitrotyrosine content, NO production, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentration in the myocardium; quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phospholamban and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mRNA expression levels; Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of eNOS and eNOS dimers in myocardial tissue, and immunohistochemical detection of cGMP expression in the myocardium was performed. Results Studies have shown that compared with those in the control group, NO generation and the expression level of myocardial eNOS mRNA, eNOS expression of dimers, phospholamban, SERCA2a and cGMP increased significantly after the combined intervention of BH4 and nebivolol, while the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine was significantly decreased. Conclusions The combined treatment group had a synergistic effect on reducing myocardial oxidative stress, increasing eNOS content, and increasing NO production, and had a more obvious protective effect on diastolic dysfunction through the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) pathway.

33267841/Increased prevalence of pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Jazan Region, Southwestern Saudi Arabia: important implications for malaria treatment policy Background Despite significant progress in eliminating malaria from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the disease is still endemic in the southwestern region of the country. Artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) has been used in Saudi Arabia since 2007 as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mutations associated with resistance to artemisinin and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in P. falciparum parasites circulating in Jazan region, southwestern Saudi Arabia. Methods A total of 151 P. falciparum isolates were collected between April 2018 and March 2019 from 12 of the governorates in Jazan region. Genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood spots and amplified using nested PCR. Polymorphisms in the propeller domain of the P. falciparum k13 (pfkelch13) gene and point mutations in the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes were identified by sequencing. Results No mutations in the pfkelch13 propeller domain were found in any of the 151 isolates. However, point mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were detected in 90.7% (137/151) of the isolates. The pfdhfr double mutations N51I + S108N (i.e. ACICNI haplotype) and triple mutations N51I + C59R + S108N (i.e. ACIRNI haplotype) were detected in 47% and 37.8% of the isolates, respectively. Moreover, the pfdhps single mutation at codon A437G and double mutations A437G + K540E (i.e. SGEAAI haplotype) were observed in 4.6% and 51.7% of the isolates, respectively. Interestingly, 23.8%, 25.1 and 12.6% of the isolates had quintuple, quadruple and triple mutated combined pfdhfr-pfdhps genotypes, respectively. Furthermore, significant associations were found between the prevalence of mutant haplotypes and the age, gender and nationality of the patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion This study revealed a high prevalence of point mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes of P. falciparum isolates from Jazan region, with quintuple and quadruple mutant pfdhfr-pfdhps genotypes reported for the first time in Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Peninsula. Despite the absence of the pfkelch13 mutation in the isolates examined, the pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations undermine the efficacy of SP partner drug, thereby threatening the main falciparum malaria treatment policy in Saudi Arabia, i.e. the use of AS + SP. Therefore, the continuous molecular and in-vivo monitoring of ACT efficacy in Jazan region is highly recommended.
33261644/The extended lipid panel assay: a clinically-deployed high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance method for the simultaneous measurement of lipids and Apolipoprotein B Background Standard lipid panel assays employing chemical/enzymatic methods measure total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), from which are calculated estimates of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). These lipid measures are used universally to guide management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is generally acknowledged to be superior to LDL-C for lipid-lowering therapeutic decision-making, but apoB immunoassays are performed relatively infrequently due to the added analytic cost. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the performance of a rapid, high-throughput, reagent-less assay producing an "Extended Lipid Panel" (ELP) that includes apoB, using the Vantera  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyzer platform already deployed clinically for lipoprotein particle and other testing. Methods Partial least squares regression models, using as input a defined region of proton NMR spectra of plasma or serum, were created to simultaneously quantify TC, TG, HDL-C, and apoB. Large training sets (n > ~ 1000) of patient sera analyzed independently for lipids and apoB by chemical methods were employed to ensure prediction models reflect the wide lipid compositional diversity of the population. The analytical performance of the NMR ELP assay was comprehensively evaluated. Results Excellent agreement was demonstrated between chemically-measured and ELP assay values of TC, TG, HDL-C and apoB with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.980 to 0.997. Within-run precision studies measured using low, medium, and high level serum pools gave coefficients of variation for the 4 analytes ranging from 1.0 to 3.8% for the low, 1.0 to 1.7% for the medium, and 0.9 to 1.3% for the high pools. Corresponding values for within-lab precision over 20 days were 1.4 to 3.6%, 1.2 to 2.3%, and 1.0 to 1.9%, respectively. Independent testing at three sites over 5 days produced highly consistent assay results. No major interference was observed from 38 endogenous or exogenous substances tested. Conclusions Extensive assay performance evaluations validate that the NMR ELP assay is efficient, robust, and substantially equivalent to standard chemistry assays for the clinical measurement of lipids and apoB. Routine reporting of apoB alongside standard lipid measures could facilitate more widespread utilization of apoB for clinical decision-making.

33267870/A study of malaria vector surveillance as part of the Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project in Mandla, Madhya Pradesh Background Understanding of malaria vector density, distribution, insecticide resistance, vector incrimination, infection status, and identification of sibling species are some of the essential components of vector control measures for achieving malaria elimination goals. Methods As part of the malaria elimination demonstration project, entomological surveillance was carried out from October 2017 to October 2019 by collecting indoor resting mosquitoes using hand catch method. Susceptibility test was done for determining the insecticide resistance status of vector mosquito Anopheles culicifacies using standard protocols by the World Health Organization. The cone bioassay method was used for determining the efficacy and quality of insecticide sprayed. Mosquitoes collected from different ecotypes were identified and processed for parasite identification, vector incrimination and sibling species determination. Results The two known malaria vector species (Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles fluviatilis) were found in the study area, which have been previously reported in this and adjoining areas of the State of Madhya Pradesh. The prevalence of An. culicifacies was significantly higher in all study villages with peak in July while lowest number was recorded in May. Proportion of vector density was observed to be low in foothill terrains. The other anopheline species viz, Anopheles subpictus, Anopheles annularis, Anopheles vagus, Anopheles splendidus, Anopheles pallidus, Anopheles nigerrimus and Anopheles barbirostris were also recorded in the study area, although their prevalence was significantly less compared to the An. culicifacies. In 2017, An. culicifacies was found to be resistant to dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and malathion, with possible resistance to alphacypermethrin and susceptible to deltamethrin. However, in 2019, the species was found to be resistant to alphacypermethrin, DDT, malathion, with possible resistance to deltamethrin. The bioassays revealed 82 to > 98% corrected % mortality of An. culicifacies on day-one post-spraying and 35 to 62% on follow-up day-30. Anopheles culicifacies sibling species C was most prevalent (38.5%) followed by A/D and E while B was least pre-dominant (11.9%). Anopheles fluviatilis sibling species T was most prevalent (74.6%) followed by U (25.4%) while species S was not recorded. One An.culicifacies (sibling species C) was found positive for Plasmodium falciparum by PCR tests in the mosquitoes sampled from the test areas. Conclusion Based on the nine entomologic investigations conducted between 2017-2019, it was concluded that An. culicifacies was present throughout the year while An. fluviatilis had seasonal presence in the study areas. Anopheles culicifacies was resistant to alphacypermethrin and emerging resistance to deltamethrin was observed in this area. Anopheles culicifacies was confirmed as the malaria vector. This type of information on indigenous malaria vectors and insecticide resistance is important in implementation of vector control through indoor residual spraying (IRS) and use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets for achieving the malaria elimination goals.
33261565/Baseline liver function tests and full blood count indices and their association with progression of chronic kidney disease and renal outcomes in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: the eGFR follow- up study Background Determination of risks for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression could improve strategies to reduce progression to ESKD. The eGFR Study recruited a cohort of adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (Indigenous Australians) from Northern Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia, aiming to address the heavy CKD burden experienced within these communities. Methods Using data from the eGFR study, we explored the association of baseline liver function tests (LFTs) (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), bilirubin and albumin) and full blood count (FBC) indices (white blood cell and red blood cell counts and haemoglobin) with annual eGFR decline and renal outcomes (first of 30% decline in eGFR with a follow-up eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of renal replacement therapy, or renal death). Comparisons of baseline variables across eGFR categories were calculated using analysis of variance and logistic regression as appropriate. Linear and multivariable regression models were used to estimate the annual change in eGFR for changes in FBC indices and LFTs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio for developing renal outcome for changes in baseline FBC indices and LFTs. Results Of 547 participants, 540 had at least one baseline measure of LFTs and FBC indices. The mean age was 46.1 (14.7) years and 63.6% were female. The median follow-up was 3.1 (IQR 2.8-3.6) years. Annual decline in eGFR was associated with low serum albumin (p < 0.001) and haemoglobin (p = 0.007). After adjustment for age, gender, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, diabetes, BMI, CRP, WHR, alcohol consumption, cholesterol and triglycerides, low serum albumin (p < 0.001), haemoglobin (p = 0.012) and bilirubin (p = 0.011) were associated with annual decline in eGFR. Renal outcomes were inversely associated with serum albumin (p < 0.001), bilirubin (p = 0.012) and haemoglobin (p < 0.001) and directly with GGT (p = 0.007) and ALP (p < 0.001). Other FBC indices and LFTs were not associated with annual decline in eGFR or renal outcomes. Conclusions GGT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin and haemoglobin independently associate with renal outcomes. Contrary to findings from other studies, no association was found between renal outcomes and other FBC indices. These findings may help focus strategies to prevent disease progression in this high-risk population.

33299384/Role of Muscarinic Receptors in Hypoalgesia Induced by Crocin in Neuropathic Pain Rats Objective  Crocin as an important constituent of saffron has antineuropathic pain properties; however, the exact mechanism of this effect is not known. The aim of this study was whether the hypoalgesic effect of crocin can be exerted through muscarinic receptors.  Materials and Methods  In the present project, 36 male Wistar rats (200 +- 20 g) were used. Animals randomly divided into six groups (sham, neuropathy, neuropathy + crocin, neuropathy + atropine 0.5 mg/kg, neuropathy + atropine 1 mg/kg, and neuropathy + atropine 1 mg/kg + crocin). Neuropathy was induced by the chronic constriction injury (CCI) method on the sciatic nerve. Crocin and atropine was administered intraperitoneally during 14 days following the 14th day after surgery. Pain response was detected every three days, two hours after each injection and 3 days following last injection. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were detected using the Von Frey filaments and plantar test device, respectively.  Results  CCI significantly reduced the paw withdrawal response to mechanical and thermal stimulus (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Crocin therapy significantly reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI (P < 0.05). Atropine pretreatment significantly blocked the hypoalgesic effect of crocin (P < 0.05 in mechanical allodynia and P < 0.01 in thermal hyperalgesia). Fourteen days administration of atropine alone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg but not 1 mg/kg significantly reduced CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at day 30 after surgery.  Conclusion  Crocin significantly decreased CCI-induced neuropathic pain. The hypoalgesic effect of crocin was blocked by atropine pretreatment, which indicates an important role for muscarinic receptors in the effect of crocin.
33267769/Oral mosapride can provide additional anti-emetic efficacy following total joint arthroplasty under general anesthesia: a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial Background We sought to determine (1) whether the addition of prophylactic oral mosapride to a protocol including dexamethasone and ondansetron further reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with ondansetron alone or the combination of both; (2) whether preemptive application of oral mosapride provides additional clinical benefits for bowel function and appetite, thus improving functional recovery. Methods We randomized 240 patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty to receive placebo (Control, n = 80), dexamethasone (10 mg) before anesthesia induction (Dexa, n = 82), or dexamethasone (10 mg) before anesthesia induction as well as oral mosapride (5 mg) before and after surgery (Mosa+Dexa, n = 78). Patients were assessed at 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48 h postoperatively. Primary outcomes were incidence and severity of PONV as well as complete response. Secondary outcomes were appetite, time until first defecation and ambulation, patient satisfaction score, and length of hospital stay. Results Mosa+Dexa patients showed significantly lower incidence of nausea at 6-12 h (3.8%) and over the entire evaluation period (6.4%), as well as a higher rate of complete response (89.7%) than other patients. Mosa+Dexa patients required less time to achieve first defecation and ambulation, they were hospitalized for shorter time, and they were more satisfied with clinical care. Conclusion Addition of oral mosapride further reduced incidence of PONV, especially postoperative nausea, during 6-12 h postoperatively. Moreover, preemptive application of oral mosapride can further improve appetite, bowel function, ambulation and length of hospital stay. Trial registration The study protocol was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800015896), prospectively registered on 27/04/2018.
33272314/Lipopolysaccharide exposure induces oxidative damage in Caenorhabditis elegans: protective effects of carnosine Background The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of carnosine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in Caenorhabditis elegans. Methods C. elegans individuals were stimulated for 24 h with LPS (100 mug/mL), with or without carnosine (0.1, 1, 10 mM). The survival rates and behaviors were determined. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (CAT) and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) were determined using the respective kits. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to validate the differential expression of sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, daf-16, ced-3, ced-9, sek-1, and pmk-1. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of SEK1, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cleaved caspase3, and Bcl-2. C. elegans sek-1 (km2) mutants and pmk-1 (km25) mutants were used to elucidate the role of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Results Carnosine improved the survival of LPS-treated C. elegans and rescued behavioral phenotypes. It also restrained oxidative stress by decreasing MDA levels and increasing SOD, GR, CAT, and GSH levels. RT-PCR results showed that carnosine treatment of wild-type C. elegans up-regulated the mRNA expression of the antioxidant-related genes sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, and daf-16. The expression of the anti-apoptosis-related gene ced-9 and apoptosis-related gene ced-3 was reversed by carnosine. In addition, carnosine treatment significantly decreased cleaved caspase3 levels and increased Bcl-2 levels in LPS-treated C. elegans. Apoptosis in the loss-of-function strains of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway was suppressed under LPS stress; however, the apoptotic effects of LPS were blocked in the sek-1 and pmk-1 mutants. The expression levels of sek-1 and pmk-1 mRNAs were up-regulated by LPS and reversed by carnosine. Finally, the expression of p-p38MAPK and SEK1 was significantly increased by LPS, which was reversed by carnosine. Conclusion Carnosine treatment protected against LPS injury by decreasing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis through the p38 MAPK pathway.
33273141/Crystal structure of a calcium(II)-pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) complex outside a protein environment1  Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is an important cofactor of calcium- and lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. The crystal structure of a Ca-PQQ complex (Ca3PQQ2 13H2O) is reported for the first time outside a protein environment. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is an important cofactor of calcium- and lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, and has been known for over 30 years. Crystal structures of Ca-MDH enzymes (MDH is methanol dehydrogenase) have been known for some time; however, crystal structures of PQQ with biorelevant metal ions have been lacking in the literature for decades. We report here the first crystal structure analysis of a Ca-PQQ complex outside the protein environment, namely, poly[[undecaaquabis(mu-4,5-dioxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylato)tricalcium(II)] dihydrate], {[Ca3(C14H3N2O8)2(H2O)11] 2H2O}n. The complex crystallized as Ca3PQQ2 13H2O with Ca2+ in three different positions and PQQ3-, including an extensive hydrogen-bond network. Similarities and differences to the recently reported structure with biorelevant europium (Eu2PQQ2) are discussed.
33276805/Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid alone or combining with other lipid-lowering therapies in hypercholesterolemic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials Background Bempedoic acid is a new drug that reduces cholesterol synthesis via inhibiting ATP citrate lyase. It remains unclear whether the combination of bempedoic acid and other lipid-lowering drugs is better than these drugs alone. This study systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid monotherapy or combination togethers in hypercholesterolemic patients. Methods Randomized controlled trials were searched across Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, web of science, etc. The net change scores [least squares mean (LSM) percentage change] in LDL-C level were meta-analyzed using weighted mean difference. The reductions in other lipids including total cholesterol (TC), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein (ApoB) and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were also assessed. Odds ratio (OR) of the incidence of adverse events (AEs) were calculated to evaluate the safety of bempedoic acid. Results A total of 13 trials (4858 participates) were included. Pooled data showed that the combination togethers resulted in greater reductions in LDL-C level than monotherapies (bempedoic acid + statin vs. statin: LSM difference (%), - 18.37, 95% CI, - 20.16 to - 16.57, I2 = 0; bempedoic acid + ezetimibe vs. ezetimibe: LSM difference (%), - 18.89, 95% CI, - 29.66 to - 8.13, I2 = 87%). But the difference in efficacy between bempedoic acid and ezetimibe was not obvious. Meta-regression analysis showed the treatment duration was a source of heterogeneity (adj R2 = 16.92, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.72). Furthermore, the background therapy of statin before screening decreased the efficacy of bempedoic acid. In addition, bempedoic acid also resulted in a significant reduction in TC, non-HDL-C, ApoB and hsCRP level. The OR of muscle-related AEs by the combination of bempedoic acid and statin was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.67, I2 = 0) when compared with statin alone. Conclusion This study showed the efficacy of combination togethers were similar but stronger than these drugs alone. Of note, a trend of high risk of muscle-related AEs by the combination of bempedoic acid and statin was observed, though it is not statistically significant, such risk is needed to be confirmed by more trials, because it is important for us to determine which is the better combinative administration for statin-intolerant patients.
33276798/Relationship between serum triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and sarcopenia occurrence rate in community-dwelling Chinese adults Background A study conducted on elderly Korean men showed that a high serum triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio was associated with a high risk of developing sarcopenia. We aimed to determine such an association in community-dwelling Chinese adults. Methods From May 2016 to August 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study on Chinese adults at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate a possible relationship between TG/HDL-C ratio and sarcopenia occurrence. Results We included 2613 adults in this study, with 13.85% presenting with sarcopenia. The odds ratios (ORs) for TG and HDL-C were 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.87), and 1.97 (95% CI: 1.49-2.61), respectively. Moreover, TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with sarcopenia status (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49-0.81). Conclusions We found that TG and HDL-C were, respectively, negatively and positively associated with sarcopenia occurrence rate in community-dwelling Chinese adults. However, a negative association was found between sarcopenia occurrence rate and TG/HDL-C ratio.

33276745/CSE/H2S system alleviates uremic accelerated atherosclerosis by regulating TGF-beta/Smad3 pathway in 5/6 nephrectomy ApoE-/- mice Background Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to inhibit the atherosclerosis development and progression. It is produced by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) in the cardiovascular system. In our previous study, it has been shown that CSE/H2S system plays a significant role in the changes of uremic accelerated atherosclerosis (UAAS), but the mechanism is not known clearly. Methods In this study, we explored the antagonism of CSE/H2S system in UAAS and identified its possible signaling molecules in ApoE-/- mice with 5/6 nephrectomy and fed with atherogenic diet. Mice were divided into sham operation group (sham group), UAAS group, sodium hydrosulfide group (UAAS+NaHS group) and propargylglycine group (UAAS+PPG group). Serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, lipid levels and lesion size of atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic roots were analyzed. Meanwhile, the expression of CSE, TGF-beta and phosphorylation of Smad3 were detected. Results Compared with sham group, the aortic root of ApoE-/- mice in the UAAS group developed early atherosclerosis, the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, serum creatinine and urea nitrogen were also higher than that in the sham group. NaHS administration can inhibit the development of atherosclerosis, but PPG administration can accelerate the atherosclerosis development. Meanwhile, the protein expression levels of CSE and TGF-beta and phosphorylation of Smad3 significantly decreased in the UAAS mice. Treatment of UAAS mice with NaHS inhibited TGF-beta protein expression and Smad3 phosphorylation decrease, but PPG treatment had the opposite effect. Conclusions The CSE/H2S system is of great importance for treating atherosclerosis in patients with chronic kidney disease, and it may protect the vascular from atherosclerosis through the TGF-beta/Smad pathway.
33253601/Pinellia ternata attenuates carotid artery intimal hyperplasia and increases endothelial progenitor cell activity via the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway in wire-injured rats Abstract Context  Clinically, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. (Araceae) (PT) has been widely used in the treatment of atherosclerosis and hyperlipidaemia, but the underlying mechanisms are still not clearly understood. Objective  This research was conducted to confirm the mechanism by which PT affects carotid artery intimal hyperplasia. Materials and methods  An intestinal hyperplasia Sprague-Dawley rat model was established by carotid artery injury. The rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8): sham, model, PT (with daily intragastric administration of 10 g/mL/kg PT tubers water extract), PT+LY294002 (with intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg LY294002 + 10 g/mL/kg PT) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (with injection of 5 x 105/cells), and treated for 4 or 8 weeks. Results  HE staining showed that PT attenuated intimal hyperplasia. RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that PT increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and eNOS in the atherosclerotic carotid artery. PT increased the Dil-acLDL+/FITC-UEA-1+ population (from 0.41 +- 0.085% to 0.60 +- 0.092%) in the blood, decreased TCHO, TG, LDL-C, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels, and increased HDL-C and IL-10 levels in the blood. However, these changes were reversed by the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002. Discussion and conclusions  PT can be developed as an atherosclerosis and carotid intimal hyperplasia treatment drug. Therefore, further study will focus on the effects of PT on intimal hyperplasia in wire-injured atherosclerosis patients and explore in depth some other relevant molecular mechanisms.
33253607/The role of Nrf2 in astragaloside IV-mediated antioxidative protection on heart failure Abstract Context Heart failure is one of the most serious diseases worldwide. Astragaloside IV (ASI) is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Objective To elucidate the antioxidative mechanism of ASI in a rat model of left coronary artery ligation. Materials and methods Left coronary artery of Sprague-Dawley rats was ligated to establish the model of heart failure, and then vehicle (saline) or ASI (1 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to the rats (n = 15) for 6 weeks. Echocardiography was used to evaluate the cardiac function. Myocardial infarct size was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Oxidative stress in the ventricular myocardium was determined. Molecular mechanisms were investigated by Western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Results ASI improved the cardiac function, especially ejection fraction (75.27 +- 5.75% vs. 36.26 +- 4.14%) and fractional shortening (45.39 +- 3.66% vs. 17.88 +- 1.32%), and reduced the infarct size of left ventricle (20.69 +- 2.98% vs. 39.11 +- 3.97%). ASI maintained the levels of glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase and prevented the leakage of creatine kinase. In addition, ASI induced the protein expression of Nrf2 (1.97-fold) and HO-1 (2.79-fold), while reduced that of Keap-1 (0.77-fold) in the ventricular myocardium. In H9c2 cells, a rat cardiomyocyte cell line, ASI induced the translocation of Nrf2 from cytoplasm to nucleus, followed by transcriptional activation of NQO-1 (8.27-fold), SOD-2 (3.27-fold) and Txn-1 (9.83-fold) genes. Discussion and conclusions ASI prevented heart failure by counteracting oxidative stress through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Application in clinical practice warrants further investigation.
33264567/Effects of Heshouwuyin on gene expression of the insulin/IGF signalling pathway in rat testis and spermatogenic cells Abstract Context  The Chinese herbal formula Heshouwu decoction (Heshouwuyin) has protective effects on testicular function in aging male rats, but the mechanism is unknown. Objective  This study investigated whether Heshouwuyin affects the testicular function of aging rats by regulating the insulin/IGF signalling pathway. Materials and methods  Sixteen-month-old male Wistar rats in the Heshouwuyin group and the natural-aging group were orally administered Heshouwuyin granules (0.056 g/kg) or equivalent normal saline for 60 d. The testicular tissue of 12-month-old male Wistar rats was removed as a young control group (n = 10). The testicular tissue and spermatogenic cells were studied. Results  The immunofluorescence results revealed that the insulin receptor (INSR)- (0.056 +- 0.00548), insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS1)- (0.251 +- 0.031), IRS2 (0.230 +- 0.019)- and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-positive cell rate (0.33 +- 0.04) in the aging group was higher than that in the young control group (0.116 +- 0.011, 0.401 +- 0.0256, 0.427 +- 0.031, 0.56 +- 0.031; p < 0.01), and the IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3)-positive cell rate (0.42 +- 0.024) was lower than that (0.06 +- 0.027) in the young group (p < 0.01). The intervention of Heshouwuyin reversed the above phenomena. The qPCR and immunoblot results were consistent with those of the immunofluorescence. The same results were obtained in spermatogenic cells. Conclusions  Our research shows that Heshouwuyin can regulate the insulin/IGF signalling pathway to improve testicular function, and provides an experimental basis for further clinical use.
32935483/Buprenorphine is a weak dopamine releaser relative to heroin, but its pretreatment attenuates heroin-evoked dopamine release in rats Aims: The United States of America is currently in an opioid epidemic. Heroin remains the most lethal opioid option with its death rate increasing by over 500% in the last decade. The rewarding and reinforcing effects of heroin are thought to be mediated by its ability to increase dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens shell. By activating Gi/o-coupled mu-opioid receptors, opioids are thought to indirectly excite midbrain dopamine neurons by removing an inhibitory GABAergic tone. The partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine is a substitution-based therapy for heroin dependence that is thought to produce a steady-state level of mu-opioid receptor activation. But it remains unclear how buprenorphine alters dopamine release relative to heroin and how buprenorphine alters the dopamine-releasing effects of heroin. Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and heroin is a full agonist, we predicted that buprenorphine would function as a weak dopamine releaser relative to heroin, while functioning as a competitive antagonist if administered in advance of heroin. Methods: We performed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in awake and behaving rats to measure how heroin, buprenorphine HCl, and their combination affect transient dopamine release events in the nucleus accumbens shell. We also performed a complimentary pharmacokinetic analysis comparing opioid plasma levels at time points correlated to our neurochemical findings. Results: Both buprenorphine and heroin produced changes in the frequency of transient dopamine release events, although the effect of buprenorphine was weak and only observed at a low dose. In comparison with vehicle, the frequency of dopamine release events maximally increased by~25% following buprenorphine treatment and by~60% following heroin treatment. Distinct neuropharmacological effects were observed in the high-dose range. The frequency of dopamine release events increased linearly with heroin dose but biphasically with buprenorphine dose. We also found that buprenorphine pretreatment occluded the dopamine-releasing effects of heroin, but plasma levels of buprenorphine had returned to baseline at this time point. Conclusion: These findings support the notion that low-dose buprenorphine is a weak dopamine releaser relative to heroin and that buprenorphine pretreatment can block the dopamine-releasing effects of heroin. The finding that high-dose buprenorphine fails to increase dopamine release might explain its relatively low abuse potential among opioid-dependent populations. Because high-dose buprenorphine decreased dopamine release before occluding heroin-evoked dopamine release, and buprenorphine was no longer detected in plasma, we conclude that the mechanisms through which buprenorphine blocks heroin-evoked dopamine release involve multifaceted pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions.
33276741/Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease with Sjogren's syndrome and secondary membranous nephropathy: a case report and review of the literature Background Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder and lacks treatment consensus. Herein, we report a case of iMCD complicated with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and secondary membranous nephropathy (SMN). Case presentation A 45-year-old female with dry mouth for 3 months and anasarca and proteinuria for 2 months was admitted. She also experienced chest tightness, wheezing, fever, weight loss, moderate proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a tissue mass in the thymus area and enlarged multiple lymph nodes. Her symptoms did not improve after resection of the thymus mass. The pathological findings were "reactive hyperplasia of the mediastinal lymph nodes and thymic hyperplasia". Lymph node biopsy findings confirmed iMCD with human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) negativity. Based on anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:320, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibody positivity, salivary flow less than 0.1 ml/min and lip biopsy with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, SS was diagnosed. Kidney biopsy showed secondary membranous nephropathy with endocapillary cell proliferation and infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the tubulointerstitium. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly increased, and therapy with tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) worked well. The combination of cyclophosphamide (CyS) with methylprednisolone (MP) maintained satisfactory remission. Conclusions Our case of iMCD with SS and SMN is rare. There is a need for increased awareness of the disease to avoid unnecessary procedures and misdiagnoses. IL-6 was extremely high, and there was a rapid response to anti-IL-6 receptor agents. The combination of CyS with MP maintained complete remission.
33312339/Ameliorative Effect of Sinapic Acid on Dextran Sodium Sulfate- (DSS-) Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Kunming (KM) Mice Ulcerative colitis is a chronic gastrointestinal disease characterized by intestinal inflammation and serious mucosal damage. As a naturally hydroxycinnamic acid, sinapic acid (SA) has antioxidant, anticancer, and neuroprotective activities. We investigated the anticolitic effect and potential mechanisms of SA in DSS-induced colitis in Kunming (KM) mice. SA treatment significantly reduced body weight loss, colon shortening, and intestinal wall thickening in colitis mice. SA treatment also significantly reduced the histological infiltration of inflammatory cells and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the colons of colitis mice. The administration of SA attenuated oxidative damage by enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase and reduced the serum and colonic mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines in colitis mice. We used qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays and demonstrated that SA reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and attenuated intestinal permeability by enhancing the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 in colitis mice. Here, we conclude that SA exhibits great anticolitic activity against DSS-induced colitis by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reducing intestinal inflammation, and maintaining the intestinal barrier. Finally, we suggest that SA may be a safe adjuvant for the prevention of clinical colitis.
33287814/Enhancement of Monascus yellow pigments production by activating the cAMP signalling pathway in Monascus purpureus HJ11 Background Monascus azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs), which were produced by Monascus species, have been used as important food colorant and food supplements for more than one billion people during their daily life. Moreover, MonAzPs recently have received more attention because of their diverse physiological activities. However, the high microbial production of MonAzPs is still not always guaranteed. Herein, the aim of this study was to develop an efficient biotechnological process for MonAzPs production. Results In this study, exogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) treatment not only induced MonAzPs production, but also stimulated the expression of a cAMP phosphodiesterase gene, named as mrPDE, in M. purpureus HJ11. Subsequently, MrPDE was identified as a cAMP phosphodiesterase by in vitro enzymatic reaction with purified enzyme. Further, a gene knockout mutant of mrPDE was constructed to verify the activation of cAMP signalling pathway. Deletion of mrPDE in M. purpureus HJ11 improved cAMP concentration by 378% and enhanced PKA kinase activity 1.5-fold, indicating that activation of cAMP signalling pathway was achieved. The DeltamrPDE strain produced MonAzPs at 8563 U/g, with a 2.3-fold increase compared with the WT strain. Moreover, the NAPDH/NADP+ ratio of the DeltamrPDE strain was obviously higher than that of the wild type strain, which led to a higher proportion of yellow MonAzPs. With fed-batch fermentation of the DeltamrPDE strain, the production and yield of MonAzPs achieved 332.1 U/mL and 8739 U/g. Conclusions A engineered M. purpureus strain for high MonAzPs production was successfully developed by activating the cAMP signalling pathway. This study not only describes a novel strategy for development of MonAzPs-producing strain, but also provides a roadmap for engineering efforts towards the production of secondary metabolism in other filamentous fungi.
33287733/The real-world effectiveness of sucroferric oxyhydroxide in European hemodialysis patients: a 1-year retrospective database analysis Background The iron-based phosphate binder (PB), sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SFOH), demonstrated its effectiveness for lowering serum phosphate levels, with low daily pill burden, in clinical trials of dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia. This retrospective database analysis evaluated the real-world effectiveness of SFOH for controlling serum phosphate in European hemodialysis patients. Methods De-identified patient data were extracted from a clinical database (EuCliD ) for adult hemodialysis patients from France, Italy, Portugal, Russia and Spain who were newly prescribed SFOH for up to 1 year as part of routine clinical care. Serum phosphate and pill burden were compared between baseline (3-month period before starting SFOH) and four consecutive quarterly periods of SFOH therapy (Q1-Q4; 12 months) in the overall cohort and three subgroups: PB-naive patients treated with SFOH monotherapy (mSFOH), and PB-pretreated patients who were either switched to SFOH monotherapy (PB   mSFOH), or received SFOH in addition to another PB (PB + SFOH). Results 1096 hemodialysis patients (mean age: 60.6 years; 65.8% male) were analyzed, including 796, 188 and 53 patients in, respectively, the PB + SFOH, mSFOH, and PB   mSFOH groups. In the overall cohort, serum phosphate decreased significantly from 1.88 mmol/L at baseline to 1.77-1.69 mmol/L during Q1-Q4, and the proportion of patients achieving serum phosphate <=1.78 mmol/L increased from 41.3% at baseline to 56.2-62.7% during SFOH treatment. Mean PB pill burden decreased from 6.3 pills/day at baseline to 5.0-5.3 pills/day during Q1-Q4. The subgroup analysis found the proportion of patients achieving serum phosphate <=1.78 mmol/L increased significantly from baseline during SFOH treatment in the PB + SFOH group (from 38.1% up to 60.9% [Q2]) and the mSFOH group (from 49.5% up to 75.2% [Q2]), but there were no significant changes in the PB   mSFOH group. For the PB + SFOH group, serum phosphate reductions were achieved with a similar number of PB pills prescribed at baseline prior to SFOH treatment (6.5 vs 6.2 pills/day at Q4). SFOH daily pill burden was low across all 3 subgroups (2.1-2.8 pills/day). Conclusion In this real-world study of European hemodialysis patients, prescription of SFOH as monotherapy to PB-naive patients, or in addition to existing PB therapy, was associated with significant improvements in serum phosphate control and a low daily pill burden.
33287718/Prior exposure of Arabidopsis seedlings to mechanical stress heightens jasmonic acid-mediated defense against necrotrophic pathogens Background Prolonged mechanical stress (MS) causes thigmomorphogenesis, a stress acclimation response associated with increased disease resistance. What remains unclear is if; 1) plants pre-exposed to a short period of repetitive MS can prime defence responses upon subsequent challenge with necrotrophic pathogens, 2) MS mediates plant immunity via jasmonic acid (JA) signalling, and 3) a short period of repetitive MS can cause long-term changes in gene expression resembling a stress-induced memory. To address these points, 10-days old juvenile Arabidopsis seedlings were mechanically stressed for 7-days using a soft brush and subsequently challenged with the necrotrophic pathogens, Alternaria brassicicola, and Botrytis cinerea. Here we assessed how MS impacted structural cell wall appositions, disease symptoms and altered gene expression in response to infection. Results The MS-treated plants exhibited enhanced cell wall appositions and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation that correlated with a reduction in disease progression compared to unstressed plants. The expression of genes involved in JA signalling, callose deposition, peroxidase and phytoalexin biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species detoxification were hyper-induced 4-days post-infection in MS-treated plants. The loss-of-function in JA signalling mediated by the JA-insensitive coronatine-insensitive 1 (coi1) mutant impaired the hyper-induction of defense gene expression and promoted pathogen proliferation in MS-treated plants subject to infection. The basal expression level of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 1 and PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2 defense marker genes were constitutively upregulated in rosette leaves for 5-days post-MS, as well as in naive cauline leaves that differentiated from the inflorescence meristem well after ceasing MS. Conclusion This study reveals that exposure of juvenile Arabidopsis plants to a short repetitive period of MS can alter gene expression and prime plant resistance upon subsequent challenge with necrotrophic pathogens via the JA-mediated COI1 signalling pathway. MS may facilitate a stress-induced memory to modulate the plant's response to future stress encounters. These data advance our understanding of how MS primes plant immunity against necrotrophic pathogens and how that could be utilised in sustainable agricultural practices.
33312341/6,8-Diprenylorobol Induces Apoptosis in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells via Activation of FOXO3 and Inhibition of CYP2J2 6,8-Diprenylorobol is a phytochemical derived from the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. 6,8-Diprenylorobol exhibits several biological activities, but the effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on cancers have been hardly investigated. This study is aimed at elucidating the anticancer effect and working mechanism of 6,8-diprenylorobol in HepG2 and Huh-7, two kinds of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. WST-1, cell counting, and colony formation assays and morphological change analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment decreased the cell viability and proliferation rate. Cell cycle analysis indicated that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the population of the G1/0 stage. Annexin V/PI double staining and TUNEL analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the apoptotic cell population and DNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the expression of cleaved PARP1, cleaved caspase-3, FOXO3, Bax, Bim, p21, and p27 but decreased the expression of Bcl2 and BclXL. Interestingly, 6,8-diprenylorobol inhibited CYP2J2-mediated astemizole O-demethylation and ebastine hydroxylase activities with Ki values of 9.46 and 2.61 muM, respectively. CYP2J2 siRNA transfection enhanced the anticancer effect of 6,8-diprenylorobol in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells through the downregulation of CYP2J2 protein expression and upregulation of FOXO3. Taken together, this study proposes that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment may be a useful therapeutic option against HCC by targeting CYP2J2 and FOXO3.
33312338/NOX2-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species in Cancer The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the myeloid cell NADPH oxidase NOX2 is critical for the destruction of engulfed microorganisms. However, recent studies imply that ROS, formed by NOX2+ myeloid cells in the malignant microenvironment, exert multiple actions of relevance to the growth and spread of neoplastic cells. By generating ROS, tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and NOX2+ leukemic myeloid cells may thus (i) compromise the function and viability of adjacent cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, (ii) oxidize DNA to trigger cancer-promoting somatic mutations, and (iii) affect the redox balance in cancer cells to control their proliferation and survival. Here, we discuss the impact of NOX2-derived ROS for tumorigenesis, tumor progression, regulation of antitumor immunity, and metastasis. We propose that NOX2 may be a targetable immune checkpoint in cancer.
33312070/High-Fructose Diet Increases Inflammatory Cytokines and Alters Gut Microbiota Composition in Rats High-fructose diet induced changes in gut microbiota structure and function, which have been linked to inflammatory response. However, the effect of small or appropriate doses of fructose on gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokines is not fully understood. Hence, the abundance changes of gut microbiota in fructose-treated Sprague-Dawley rats were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The effects of fructose diet on metabolic disorders were evaluated by blood biochemical parameter test, histological analysis, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis, ELISA analysis, and Western blot. Rats were intragastrically administered with pure fructose at the dose of 0 (Con), 2.6 (Fru-L), 5.3 (Fru-M), and 10.5 g/kg/day (Fru-H) for 20 weeks. The results showed that there were 36.5% increase of uric acid level in the Fru-H group when compared with the Con group. The serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MIP-2) were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) with fructose treatment. A higher fructose intake induced lipid accumulation in the liver and inflammatory cell infiltration in the pancreas and colon and increased the abundances of Lachnospira, Parasutterella, Marvinbryantia, and Blantia in colonic contents. Fructose intake increased the expressions of lipid accumulation proteins including perilipin-1, ADRP, and Tip-47 in the colon. Moreover, the higher level intake of fructose impaired intestinal barrier function due to the decrease of the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin). In summary, there were no negative effects on body weight, fasting blood glucose, gut microbiota, and SCFAs in colonic contents of rats when fructose intake is in small or appropriate doses. High intake of fructose can increase uric acid, proinflammatory cytokines, intestinal permeability, and lipid accumulation in the liver and induce inflammatory response in the pancreas and colon.
33287709/Ectopic expression of a grape nitrate transporter VvNPF6.5 improves nitrate content and nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis Background Nitrate plays an important role in grapevines vegetative and reproductive development. However, how grapevines uptake, translocate and utilize nitrate and the molecular mechanism still remains to be investigated. Results In this study, we report the functional characterization of VvNPF6.5, a member of nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NRT1/PTR/NPF) in Vitis vinifera. Subcellular localization in Arabidopsis protoplasts indicated that VvNPF6.5 is plasma membrane localized. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that VvNPF6.5 is expressed predominantly in roots and stems and its expression is rapidly induced by nitrate. Functional characterization using cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that VvNPF6.5 uptake nitrate in a pH dependent way and function as a dual-affinity nitrate transporter involved in both high- and low-affinity nitrate uptake. Further ectopic expression of VvNPF6.5 in Arabidopsis resulted in more 15NO3- accumulation in shoots and roots and significantly improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Moreover, VvNPF6.5 might participate in the nitrate signaling by positively regulating the expression of primary nitrate response genes. Conclusion Our results suggested that VvNPF6.5 encodes a pH-dependent, dual-affinity nitrate transporter. VvNPF6.5 regulates nitrate uptake and allocation in grapevines and is involved in primary nitrate response.

33287856/The associations between p,p'-DDE levels and plasma levels of lipoproteins and their subclasses in an elderly population determined by analysis of lipoprotein content Background Lipoproteins at aberrant levels are known to play a role in cardiovascular disease. The metabolite of the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), physically associates with lipids and accumulates in adipose tissue. Little is known about which lipoproteins associate with p,p'-DDE. An association between p,p'-DDE exposure and altered levels of circulating lipids was assessed in a large human cohort using a detailed analysis of lipoprotein content. Methods Plasma samples were collected from the subset of 75-year old Swedes in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature of Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) cohort who were not prescribed lipid lowering medication (n = 571). p,p'-DDE concentrations in plasma were measured using high-throughput solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Analysis of plasma lipoprotein content was performed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results Detectable levels of p,p'-DDE were found in the plasma samples of all subjects. Elevated p,p'-DDE levels were associated with increased concentrations of lipoproteins of all diameters, with the exception of high density lipoprotein (HDL) of diameters between 14.3 nm-10.9 nm. Of the lipoprotein constituents, triglycerides were most uniformly associated with elevated p,p'-DDE across lipoproteins. p,p'-DDE was furthermore associated with apolipoprotein B, but not apolipoprotein A1. Conclusions The positive associations observed between each lipoprotein class and elevated p,p'-DDE support previous data suggesting that p,p'-DDE interacts with lipoproteins within plasma. It is speculated that both physio-chemical and biological mechanisms may explain why p,p'-DDE does not uniformly associate with lipids across lipoproteins.

33287729/Perioperative Dexmedetomidine attenuates brain ischemia reperfusion injury possibly via up-regulation of astrocyte Connexin 43 Background Astrocyte Connexin 43 (Cx43) is essential for the trophic and protective support of neurons during brain ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. It is believed that dexmedetomidine participates in Cx43-mediated effects. However, its mechanisms remained unclear. This study aims to address the relationship and regulation among them. Methods Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to the 90-min right middle cerebral arterial occlusion with or without dexmedetomidine pretreatment (5 mug/kg). Neurological functions were evaluated and brain lesions, as well as inflammatory factors (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha), were assessed. Ischemic penumbral cortex was harvested to determine the expression of astrocyte Cx43. Primary astrocytes were cultured to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on Cx43 after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Results Dexmedetomidine pretreatment attenuated neurological injury, brain lesions and expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) after brain ischemia (P < 0.05). Astrocyte Cx43 was down-regulated by brain I/R injury, both in vivo and in vitro, which were reversed by dexmedetomidine (P < 0.05). This effect was mediated by the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta. Further studies with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or SB216763 (GSK-3beta inhibitor) confirmed the effect of dexmedetomidine on astrocyte Cx43. Conclusions Perioperative dexmedetomidine administration attenuates neurological injury after brain I/R injury, possibly through up-regulation of astrocyte Cx43. Activation of PI3K-Akt-GSK-3beta pathway might contribute to this protective effect.

33287728/1Selenium supply alters the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of cadmium and the expression of transporter genes involved in cadmium uptake and translocation in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) Background Cadmium (Cd) accumulation in crops affects the yield and quality of crops and harms human health. The application of selenium (Se) can reduce the absorption and transport of Cd in winter wheat. Results The results showed that increasing Se supply significantly decreased Cd concentration and accumulation in the shoot and root of winter wheat and the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd. Se application increased the root length, surface area and root volume but decreased the average root diameter. Increasing Se supply significantly decreased Cd concentration in the cell wall, soluble fraction and cell organelles in root and shoot. An increase in Se supply inhibited Cd distribution in the organelles of shoot and root but enhanced Cd distribution in the soluble fraction of shoot and the cell wall of root. The Se supply also decreased the proportion of active Cd (ethanol-extractable (FE) Cd and deionized water-extractable (FW) Cd) in root. In addition, the expression of TaNramp5-a, TaNramp5-b, TaHMA3-a, TaHMA3-b and TaHMA2 significantly increased with increasing Cd concentration in root, and the expression of TaNramp5-a, TaNramp5-b and TaHMA2 in root was downregulated by increasing Se supply, regardless of Se supply or Cd stress. The expression of TaHMA3-b in root was significantly downregulated by 10 muM Se at both the 5 muM and 25 muM Cd level but upregulated by 5 muM Se at the 25 muM Cd level. The expression of TaNramp5-a, TaNramp5-b, TaHMA3-a, TaHMA3-b and TaHMA2 in shoot was downregulated by increasing Se supply at 5 muM Cd level, and 5 muM Se upregulated the expression of those genes in shoot at 25 muM Cd level. Conclusions The results confirm that Se application limits Cd accumulation in wheat by regulating the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in winter wheat tissues, as well as the expression of TaNramp5-a, TaNramp5-b and TaHMA2 in root.

32896112/Lack of rewarding effects of a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor TPPU in mice: Comparison with morphine Abstract Aim Although opioids have been used as treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids have abuse potential in humans. Since soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids plays a key role in the pain, sEH inhibitors would be promising new therapeutic drugs for neuropathic pain. In this study, we examined the effect of the sEH inhibitor TPPU on rewarding effects in mice using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Methods The rewarding effects of morphine (10 mg/kg) and TPPU (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) in mice were examined using CPP paradigm. Furthermore, the effect of TPPU (30 mg/kg) on morphine-induced rewarding effects was examined. Results TPPU (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) did not increase CPP scores in the mice whereas morphine significantly increased CPP scores in the mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with TPPU did not block the rewarding effects of morphine in the mice, suggesting that sEH does not play a role in the rewarding effect of morphine. Conclusion This study suggests that TPPU did not have rewarding effects in rodents. This would make sEH inhibitors potential therapeutic drugs without abuse potential for neuropathic pain. The sEH inhibitor TPPU did not increase CPP score in mice. The sEH inhibitors might not produce rewarding effects in humans. 
33037872/High-dose antipsychotic drug use as a predictor for readmission of inpatients with borderline personality disorder: A retrospective chart review in a Japanese psychiatric hospital Abstract Objective This study aimed to determine predictors associated with readmission of inpatients with borderline personality disorder. Methods This observational study evaluated 83 inpatients with borderline personality disorder admitted to the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry Hospital in Japan from January 2013 to January 2016. Data were retrospectively obtained from electronic medical records. Results There was no significant difference in the daily antipsychotic dose equivalent to chlorpromazine at admission between the readmitted and nonreadmitted groups, which indicated that there was no between-group difference in the psychiatric disease severity at admission. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the use of antipsychotics equivalent to >400 mg of chlorpromazine at discharge was associated with readmission within 1 year. Conclusions In conclusion, high-dose antipsychotic drug use at discharge may be a risk factor for readmission. The present findings may have important clinical implications since they alert physicians to a possible predictor for readmissions of patients with borderline personality disorder. There is limited available information regarding predictors associated with repetitive admission of patients with BPD. This study aimed to evaluate predictors associated with readmission of inpatients with BPD. 1. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the use of antipsychotics equivalent to >400 mg of chlorpromazine at discharge was associated with readmission within 1 year. 2. High-dose antipsychotic drug use at discharge may be a risk factor for readmissions. 
32902200/Lurasidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine extended-release for bipolar depression: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of phase 3 trials in Japan Abstract Aim This systematic review and random-effect model, network meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials in Japan assessed the efficacy and safety profile of lurasidone compared with olanzapine and quetiapine extended-release (QUE-XR) for the treatment of bipolar depression. Methods The study included double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials in Japan that included patients with bipolar depression. Outcomes included response rate (primary), remission rate (secondary), improvement of Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, discontinuation rates, and incidence of individual adverse events. Results Three studies were included (n = 1223). Lurasidone and olanzapine but not QUE-XR were superior to placebo in response rate [risk ratio (95% credible interval): lurasidone = 0.78 (0.66, 0.92); olanzapine = 0.84 (0.71, 0.99); QUE-XR = 0.87 (0.73, 1.03)]. Lurasidone, olanzapine and QUE-XR were superior to placebo in remission rate [lurasidone = 0.90 (0.83, 0.98); olanzapine = 0.87 (0.77, 0.99); QUE-XR = 0.84 (0.73, 0.98)] and the improvement of MADRS total score. There were not differences in discontinuation rates between each antipsychotic and placebo. Compared with placebo, lurasidone was higher incidence of akathisia, and increased body weight and blood prolactin level; olanzapine was higher incidence of somnolence and >=7% weight gain, and increased body weight, blood total cholesterol level, blood LDL cholesterol level, and blood triglyceride levels; QUE-XR was higher incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, somnolence, dry mouth, constipation and >=7% weight gain, and increased body weight, blood total cholesterol level, blood LDL cholesterol level, and blood triglyceride levels. Conclusions Our results suggested although the efficacy of three SGAs was similar, there were the differences in the safety profile among the SGAs. The efficacy of three SGAs was similar. The safety profile was different in three SGAs. 
33107693/Retrospective analysis of heroin detoxification with buprenorphine in a psychiatric hospital in Japan Abstract Aim We assessed the efficacy of buprenorphine replacement taper therapy in a psychiatric hospital in Japan. Methods Based on the medical records, a retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the outcomes of buprenorphine replacement taper therapy in 106 subjects with heroin dependence. Results We found that replacement and taper therapy with buprenorphine could significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms during detoxification. In addition, the completion rate of detoxification was significantly improved and the length of hospital stay was significantly reduced relative to those who received conventional treatment without buprenorphine. However, the readmission rate increased after the introduction of detoxication therapy with buprenorphine. Conclusion The present findings suggest not only the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine replacement and taper therapy, but also the requirement for maintenance therapy for individuals with heroin dependence.
32897002/Noradrenaline enhances the excitatory effects of dopamine on medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons in rats Abstract Aim Our previous studies showed that exposure to acute restraint stress enhanced cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (cocaine-CPP) and suggested the possibility that co-activation of adrenergic transmission boosts the increase in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activity by the activation of dopaminergic transmission. To examine this possibility, the effects of the co-treatment with dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) on mPFC neurons were compared with those of treatment with DA alone using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Methods The effects of DA alone and a mixture of DA and NA on the membrane potentials and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were examined by electrophysiological recordings of mPFC pyramidal neurons in brain slices of male Sprague Dawley rats. Extracellular DA and NA levels in the mPFC during and after restraint stress exposure were also examined by in vivo microdialysis. Results Dopamine significantly produced depolarizing effects on mPFC neurons and tended to increase sEPSC frequency. Co-administration of NA with DA produced stronger depolarizing effects and significantly increased sEPSC frequency. The findings suggest that the additional depolarizing effect of NA on DA-responsive neurons, rather than the excitation of DA-nonresponsive neurons by NA, contributes to the stronger effect of co-treatment of NA with DA. Conclusion The present study suggests that NA released by restraint stress exposure cooperates with DA to stimulate DA-responsive neurons in the mPFC, thereby causing the stress-induced enhancement of cocaine-CPP. Our previous studies showed that exposure to acute restraint stress enhanced cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (cocaine-CPP). The present study revealed that noradrenaline enhanced the excitatory effects of dopamine on medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal neurons in rats. Noradrenaline released by restraint stress exposure may cooperate with dopamine to stimulate dopamine-responsive neurons in the mPFC, thereby causing the stress-induced enhancement of cocaine-CPP. 
32951324/Clozapine-associated severe eosinophilia following lithium rebound neutropenia: A case report Abstract Background Clozapine use is complicated by an increased risk of hematological adverse effects such as neutropenia and, rarely, eosinophilia. Case presentation We present the case of a 48-year-old man with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. On day 12 after clozapine initiation, he had a cough with a temperature of 39.8 C. On day 16, his leukocyte count had increased to 9320 cells/mm3 (neutrophils 7550 cells/mm3 and eosinophils 680 cells/mm3). We discontinued lithium because of neutrophilia and damage to renal function on day 20. His eosinophil count increased until day 29, reaching 6750 cells/mm3. We suspected a drug-induced reaction and discontinued clozapine on day 30. His eosinophil count gradually decreased, reaching the normal range by day 40. However, his leukocyte and neutrophil counts also gradually decreased to below than the normal range by day 40. His leukocytes and neutrophil counts had recovered by day 55. Conclusion We concluded that this patient had clozapine-associated severe eosinophilia following lithium rebound neutropenia. The eosinophil count increased reaching 6750 cells/mm3 with bronchitis and hepatitis during clozapine treatment. The leukocyte and neutrophil counts gradually decreased to below than the normal range by day 40 after discontinuation of lithium.  
32862563/Neuropsychological characteristics of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder without intellectual disability Abstract Aims While several studies have reported various cognitive impairments in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the neuropsychological profiles of adults with this disorder are understudied. Here, the intelligence and memory functions of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder without intellectual disability were evaluated. Methods The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale:Third Edition and Wechsler Memory Scale:Revised were administered to 30 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose full-scale intelligence quotients were >85. Diagnoses were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria. Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales:Self-Report:screening version and the Autism Spectrum Quotient were also evaluated. Results In the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale:Third Edition, the verbal intelligence quotient was significantly higher than the performance intelligence quotient and the verbal comprehension score was the highest among the secondary indices. In the Wechsler Memory Scale:Revised, the visual memory score was the highest measure. Although the verbal intelligence quotient had no correlation with any Wechsler Memory Scale:Revised measures, the performance intelligence quotient was significantly correlated with the visual memory and attention scores of the Wechsler Memory Scale:Revised. Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales hyperactive-impulsive score was significantly correlated with the verbal intelligence quotient, whereas the inattention score was not correlated with any measures of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale:Third Edition or Wechsler Memory Scale:Revised. Conclusions The results suggest that while adults with normal-intelligence attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have comparatively high verbal comprehension and social knowledge, their ability of information processing and visual-motor coordination are relatively weak. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale:Third Edition (WAIS-III) and Wechsler Memory Scale:Revised (WMS-R) of 30 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were examined. The verbal intelligence quotient was significantly higher than the performance intelligence quotient in the WAIS-III and the performance intelligence quotient was significantly correlated with the visual memory and attention scores of the WMS-R. Adults with ADHD have comparatively high verbal comprehension and social knowledge, while their information processing ability and visual-motor coordination are relatively weak.  
32896111/Risk factors for the onset of dependence and chronic psychosis due to cannabis use: Survey of patients with cannabis-related psychiatric disorders Abstract Aim The objective of the current study was to identify risk factors that affect the onset of dependence and chronic psychosis due to cannabis use. Methods We examined clinical genetic factors, psychiatric disorders prior to cannabis use, starting age of cannabis use, duration and frequency of cannabis use, types of cannabis products used, combined use of other psychoactive substances, and the psychiatric diagnosis of 71 patients with cannabis-related psychiatric disorders who underwent treatment at nine mental health hospitals in Japan. Information was collected from cross-sectional interview surveys conducted by each patient's attending psychiatrist. Results For the diagnosis of dependence syndrome due to the use of cannabis, we found associations with the number of years of cannabis use and the use of cannabis products with a high Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content. However, we found no association between diagnosis of residual and late-onset psychotic disorders and clinical genetic factors, presence of preceding psychiatric disorders, duration and frequency of cannabis use, starting age of cannabis use, or combined use of other psychoactive substances; an association was found only for the absence of use of cannabis products other than dried cannabis. Conclusion The onset of cannabis dependence was related to long-term cannabis use and the use of cannabis products with a high THC content. However, chronic psychosis was not associated with total THC intake or psychiatric vulnerability. Thus, unknown factors appear to be involved in the onset of chronic psychosis. The onset of cannabis dependence was related to long-term cannabis use and the use of cannabis products with a high THC content. However, chronic psychosis was not associated with total THC intake or psychiatric vulnerability. 
32990413/Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder successfully treated with the combination of ramelteon and suvorexant in a case of autism spectrum disorder Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24SWD) is often observed in the visually impaired and those who isolate indoors. Melatonin receptor agonists may be used for treatment, but there is currently no evidence that they are effective in patients without visual impairment. Case We report a case of a 23-year-old woman who withdrew from her social life owing to autism spectrum disorder and experienced an unusual sleep rhythm. She presented with N24SWD. The N24SWD cycle averaged 25.6 days but was extended to 42 days using ramelteon. However, this was not enough. We prescribed the addition of suvorexant and the sleep cycle returned to normal. Conclusion N24SWD is a disease that seriously impairs social life and productivity. We propose a possible treatment strategy for N24SWD using ramelteon and suvorexant. We present a case in which the combination therapy of ramelteon and suvorexant was effective for a patient with autism spectrum disorder with non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24SWD) owing to social withdrawal. Here, we discussed the pharmacological mechanism of the combination of ramelteon and suvorexant as a possible therapeutic strategy for patients with N24SWD. 
32812706/Decreased bone mineral density in ovariectomized mice is ameliorated after subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine Abstract Aim Depression is a common symptom in people with osteoporosis. (R)-ketamine produced greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like actions than (S)-ketamine in rodents. Here, we examined the effects of two ketamine enantiomers on the reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice which is an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Methods Female ddY mice were OVX or sham-operated. Subsequently, saline (10 mL/kg/d, twice weekly), (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/d, twice weekly), or (S)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/d, twice weekly) was administered intraperitoneally into OVX or sham mice for the 6 weeks. The femur from all mice was collected 3 days after the final injection, and BMD in the femur was measured. Results The reduction of cortical BMD and total BMD in the OVX mice was significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine. Conclusion The study shows that (R)-ketamine can ameliorate the reduced cortical BMD and total BMD in OVX mice. Therefore, (R)-ketamine would be a novel therapeutic drug for women with osteoporosis. (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, ameliorated decreased bone mineral density in ovariectomized mice. Therefore, (R)-ketamine would be a novel therapeutic drug for women with osteoporosis.  
33280468/Marinoid J, a phenylglycoside from Avicennia marina fruit, ameliorates cognitive impairment in rat vascular dementia: a quantitative iTRAQ proteomic study Abstract Context  Fruit of Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. (Acanthaceae) is used as a Chinese herb. Studies have found that it contains marinoid J, a novel phenylethanoid glycoside (PG) compound, but its neuroprotective functions are largely unknown. Objective  This study evaluated the effects of marinoid J on vascular dementia (VD) and determined its potential mechanisms of action. Materials and methods  The VD model was established by the ligation of the bilateral common carotid artery in Sprague-Dawley rats, who received daily intragastrically administration of saline, marinoid J (125 or 500 mg/kg body weight/d), or oxiracetam (250 mg/kg body weight/d) for 14 days (20 rats in each group). The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate cognitive performance. The hippocampus was subjected to histological and proteomic analyses. Results  Marinoid J shortened the escape latency of VD rats (31.07 +- 3.74 s, p < 0.05). It also decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) (27.53%) and nitric oxide (NO) (20.41%) while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) (11.26%) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (20.38%) content in hippocampus tissues. Proteomic analysis revealed 45 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in marinoid J-treated VD rats, which included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), keratin 18 (KRT18), cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), and synaptotagmin II (SYT2). Conclusions  Marinoid J played a role in protecting hippocampal neurons by regulating a set of proteins that influence oxidative stress and apoptosis, this effect may thereby alleviate the symptoms of VD rats. Thus, pharmacological manipulation of marinoid J may offer a novel opportunity for VD treatment.
33335642/In Vitro Modulation of Endogenous Antioxidant Enzyme Activities and Oxidative Stress in Autism Lymphoblastoid Cell Line (ALCL) by Stingless Bee Honey Treatment Autism has been associated with a low antioxidant defense mechanism, while honey has been known for decades for its antioxidant and healing properties. Determination of stingless bee honey (KH) effects on antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative damage in Autism Lymphoblastoid Cell Line (ALCL) was performed. ALCL and its normal sibling pair (NALCL) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium at 37 C and 5% CO2. ALCL was treated with 400 mug/mL KH (24 h), and oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage was determined via comet assay. Low SOD activity (p < 0.05) and high MDA level (p < 0.05) were observed in ALCL compared to NALCL. Higher grade (Grades 2 and 3) of DNA damage was highly observed (p < 0.05) in ALCL compared to NALCL, whereas lower grade (Grades 0 and 1) DNA damage was highly detected (p < 0.05) in NALCL compared to ALCL. KH treatment caused a significant increase in SOD and GPx activities (p < 0.05) in ALCL compared to untreated ALCL. Correspondingly, KH treatment reduced the Grade 2 DNA damage (p < 0.05) in ALCL compared to untreated ALCL. CAT activity showed no significant difference between all three groups, while the MDA level showed no significant difference between treated and untreated ALCL. In conclusion, KH treatment significantly reduced the oxidative stress in ALCL by increasing the SOD and GPx antioxidant enzyme activities, while reducing the DNA damage.
33292189/Apneic laryngeal oxygenation during elective fiberoptic intubation - a technical simulation Background Sedation during elective fiberoptic intubation for difficult airway can cause respiratory depression, apnea and periods of desaturation. During apneic episodes, hypoxemia can be prevented by insufflation of oxygen in the deep laryngeal space. The aim of this study was to evaluate an oropharyngeal oxygenation device (OOD) designed for deep laryngeal insufflation during fiberoptic intubation. Methods The OOD is split in the front to form a path for the bronchoscope. An external lumen delivers oxygen in the deep laryngeal space. In this experimental study, air application (as control group), oxygen application via nasal prongs, oxygen application via the OOD, and oxygen application via the working channel of a bronchoscope were compared in a technical simulation. In a preoxygenated test lung of a manikin, decrease of the oxygen saturation was measured over 20 min for each method. Results Oxygen saturation in the test lung dropped from 97 +- 1% (baseline in all groups) to 58 +- 3% in the control-group (p < 0.001 compared to all other groups) and to 78 +- 1% in the nasal prong group (p < 0.001 compared to all other groups). Oxygen saturation remained at 95 +- 2% in both the OOD group and the bronchoscopy group (p = 0.451 between those two groups). Conclusion Simulating apneic laryngeal oxygenation in a preoxygenated manikin, both oxygen insufflation via the OOD and the bronchoscope kept oxygen saturation in the test lung at 95% over 20 min. Both methods significantly were more effective than oxygen insufflation via nasal prongs.
33298132/Chidamide increases the sensitivity of refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia cells to anthracyclines via regulation of the HDAC3 -AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway Background Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. However, many patients experience a relapse or exhibit refractory disease (R/R). There is an urgent need for more effective regimens to reverse anthracycline resistance in these patients. Methods In this paper, Twenty-seven R/R AML patients with anthracycline resistance consecutively received chidamide in combination with anthracycline-based regimen as salvage therapy at the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Results Of the 27 patients who had received one course of salvage therapy, 13 achieved a complete response and 1 achieved a partial response. We found that the HDAC3-AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway was significantly upregulated in anthracycline-resistant AML cells compared to non-resistant cells. AML patients with higher levels of HDAC3 had lower event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates. Moreover, anthracycline-resistant AML cells are susceptible to chidamide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor which can inhibit cell proliferation, increase cell apoptosis and induce cell-cycle arrest in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Chidamide increases the sensitivity of anthracycline-resistant cells to anthracycline drugs, and these effects are associated with the inhibition of the HDAC3-AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway. Conclusion Chidamide can increase anthracycline drug sensitivity by inhibiting HDAC3-AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway, thus demonstrating the potential for application.
33298071/Susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae from Cote d'Ivoire to insecticides used on insecticide-treated nets: evaluating the additional entomological impact of piperonyl butoxide and chlorfenapyr Background Pyrethroid-treated mosquito nets are currently the mainstay of vector control in Cote d'Ivoire. However, resistance to pyrethroids has been reported across the country, limiting options for insecticide resistance management due to the paucity of alternative insecticides. Two types of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), ITNs with pyrethroids and the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), and Interceptor G2 nets, a net treated with a combination of chlorfenapyr and alpha-cypermethrin, are believed to help in the control of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. Methods The susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) to pyrethroid insecticides with and without pre-exposure to PBO as well as to chlorfenapyr was investigated in fifteen sites across the country. Susceptibility tests were conducted on 2- to 4-day old adult female An. gambiae s.l. reared from larval collections. The resistance status, intensity, and effects of PBO on mortality after exposure to different concentrations of deltamethrin, permethrin and alpha-cypermethrin were determined using WHO susceptibility test kits. In the absence of a WHO-recommended standard protocol for chlorfenapyr, two interim doses (100 and 200 microg/bottle) were used to test the susceptibility of mosquitoes using the CDC bottle assay method. Results Pre-exposure to PBO did not result in full restoration of susceptibility to any of the three pyrethroids for the An. gambiae s.l. populations from any of the sites surveyed. However, PBO pre-exposure did increase mortality for all three pyrethroids, particularly deltamethrin (from 4.4 to 48.9%). Anopheles gambiae s.l. from only one site (Bettie) were susceptible to chlorfenapyr at the dose of 100 microg active ingredient (a.i.)/bottle. At the dose of 200 microg (a.i.)/bottle, susceptibility was only recorded in 10 of the 15 sites. Conclusion Low mosquito mortality was found for pyrethroids alone, and while PBO increased mortality, it did not restore full susceptibility. The vector was not fully susceptible to chlorfenapyr in one third of the sites tested. However, vector susceptibility to chlorfenapyr seems to be considerably higher than for pyrethroids alone or with PBO. These data should be used cautiously when making ITN procurement decisions, noting that bioassays are conducted in controlled conditions and may not fully represent field efficacy where the host-seeking behaviours, which include free-flying activity are known to enhance pro-insecticide chlorfenapyr intoxication to mosquitoes.
33343803/Liproxstatin-1 Protects Hair Cell-Like HEI-OC1 Cells and Cochlear Hair Cells against Neomycin Ototoxicity Ferroptosis is a recently discovered iron-dependent form of oxidative programmed cell death distinct from caspase-dependent apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effect of ferroptosis in neomycin-induced hair cell loss by using selective ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1). Cell viability was identified by CCK8 assay. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by DCFH-DA and cellROX green staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was evaluated by TMRM staining. Intracellular iron and lipid peroxides were detected with Mito-FerroGreen and Liperfluo probes. We found that ferroptosis can be induced in both HEI-OC1 cells and neonatal mouse cochlear explants, as evidenced by Mito-FerroGreen and Liperfluo staining. Further experiments showed that pretreatment with Lip-1 significantly alleviated neomycin-induced increased ROS generation and disruption in DeltaPsim in the HEI-OC1 cells. In parallel, Lip-1 significantly attenuated neomycin-induced hair cell damage in neonatal mouse cochlear explants. Collectively, these results suggest a novel mechanism for neomycin-induced ototoxicity and suggest that ferroptosis inhibition may be a new clinical intervention to prevent hearing loss.
33343808/Protective Effect of Quercetin against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Damage in PC-12 Cells: Comprehensive Analysis of a lncRNA-Associated ceRNA Network Quercetin is a bioflavonoid with potential antioxidant properties. However, the mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. Herein, we focused on integrating long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing of PC-12 cells treated with quercetin. We treated PC-12 cells with hydrogen peroxide to generate a validated oxidative damage model. We evaluated the effects of quercetin on PC-12 cells and established the lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA profiles of these cells. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses of these RNAs were conducted to identify the key pathways. Quercetin significantly protected PC-12 neuronal cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced death. We identified 297, 194, and 14 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, respectively, associated with the antioxidant effect of quercetin. Furthermore, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway was identified as the crucial signalling pathway. Finally, we constructed a lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by utilizing oxidative damage mechanism-matched miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression profiles and those changed by quercetin. In conclusion, quercetin exerted a protective effect against oxidative stress-induced damage in PC-12 cells. Our study provides novel insight into ceRNA-mediated gene regulation in the progression of oxidative damage and the action mechanisms of quercetin.
33302891/NIMO-CKD-UK: a real-world, observational study of iron isomaltoside in patients with iron deficiency anaemia and chronic kidney disease Background Intravenous iron is often used to treat iron deficiency anaemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD), but the optimal dosing regimen remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. Methods This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for >=12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators' discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received <=1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. Results The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the <=1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the <=1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to <=1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received <=1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. Conclusions The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the <=1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received <=1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02546154, 10 September 2015.
33297997/Time changes in the spectrum of urinary stone composition: a role for climate variations? Background An increase of the frequency of uric acid urinary stones compared to calcium-containing ones has been recently described. This study was aimed at assessing the frequency of different types of urinary stones in the population of northern Italy in the period 2016-18 compared to 2001-2003. Methods Analyses by infrared spectroscopy of 1007 stones endoscopically removed at two institutions in the area of Milan (Northern Italy) were retrospectively considered. Stones were classified as calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and dihydrate (COD), mixed uric acid/calcium oxalate (UC); uric acid (UA), struvite (ST); apatite (CAP); mixed calcium oxalate / apatite (CAPOX); others. The patients were divided into two groups: 2001-2003 and 2016-2018. The average temperature values of the region over the two time periods were obtained by the national statistical institute. Results The average age of the 2001-2003 group (45.8+/- 15.4 years) was significantly lower than the average age of the 2016-18 group (57.9+/- 14.8) (0.000). M / F ratio was similar in the two groups: 119 / 69 (1,0.58) in 2001-2003 and 527 / 292 (1,0.55) in 2016-18 (p = 0.862). COM stones tended to more frequent in 2016-18 group than in 2001-03. COD stones were significantly more frequent in 2001-03 than in 2016-18. ST stone frequency was increased from 2001 to 03 to 2016-18. No increase of uric acid containing stones was observed in 2016-18. Results were confirmed after adjustment by age. Averages annual regional temperatures increased from 14  C to 15.4  C during the two observation periods. Conclusions No increase of UA stones was observed, probably due to the limited impact of the global warming in our temperate climate.
33302945/Selective cytotoxic and anti-metastatic activity in DU-145 prostate cancer cells induced by Annona muricata L. bark extract and phytochemical, annonacin Background Annona muricata L. was identified as a popular medicinal plant in treatment regimens among cancer patients in Jamaica by a previously conducted structured questionnaire. Ethnomedically used plant parts, were examined in this study against human prostate cancer cells for the first time and mechanisms of action elucidated for the most potent of them, along with the active phytochemical, annonacin. Methods Nine extracts of varying polarity from the leaves and bark of A. muricata were assessed initially for cytotoxicity using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on PC-3 prostate cancer cells and the ethyl acetate bark (EAB) extract was identified as the most potent. EAB extract was then standardized for annonacin content using High-performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and shown to be effective against a second prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) also. The mode of cell death in DU-145 cells were assessed via several apoptotic assays including induction of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases and annexin V externalization combined with morphological observations using confocal microscopy. In addition, the potential to prevent metastasis was examined via inhibition of cell migration, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenesis using the chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). Results Annonacin and EAB extract displayed selective and potent cytotoxicity against the DU-145 prostate carcinoma cells with IC50 values of 0.1 +- 0.07 muM and 55.501 +- 0.55 mug/mL respectively, without impacting RWPE-1 normal prostate cells, in stark contrast to chemotherapeutic docetaxel which lacked such selectivity. Docetaxel's impact on the cancerous DU-145 was improved by 50% when used in combination with EAB extract. Insignificant levels of intracellular ROS content, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, Caspase 3/7 activation, annexin V content, along with stained morphological evaluations, pointed to a non-apoptotic mode of cell death. The extract at 50 mug/mL deterred cell migration in the wound-healing assay, while inhibition of angiogenesis was displayed in the CAM and VEGF inhibition assays for both EAB (100 mug /mL) and annonacin (0.5 muM). Conclusions Taken together, the standardized EAB extract and annonacin appear to induce selective and potent cell death via a necrotic pathway in DU-145 cells, while also preventing cell migration and angiogenesis, which warrant further examinations for mechanistic insights and validity in-vivo.
33298075/Hepatic lipid profile in mice fed a choline-deficient, low-methionine diet resembles human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Background Emerging data support a role for lipids in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. With experimental models such data can be challenged or validated. Mice fed a low-methionine, choline-deficient (LMCD) diet develop NASH and, when injected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN), HCC. Here, lipidomic analysis was used to elucidate whether the NASH and HCC associated lipid derangements resemble the lipid profile of the human disease. Methods Lipids were measured in the liver of mice fed a control or a LMCD diet for 16 weeks. DEN was injected at young age to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. DEN treatment associated changes of the lipid composition and the tumor lipidome were evaluated. Results LMCD diet fed mice accumulated ceramides and triacylglycerols in the liver. Phospholipids enriched with monounsaturated fatty acids were also increased, whereas hepatic cholesterol levels remained unchanged in the LMCD model. Phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine concentrations declined in the liver of LMCD diet fed mice. The changes of most lipids associated with LMCD diet feeding were similar between water and DEN injected mice. Several polyunsaturated (PU) diacylglycerol species were already low in the liver of DEN injected mice fed the control diet. Tumors developed in the liver of LMCD diet fed mice injected with DEN. The tumor specific lipid profile, however, did not resemble the decrease of ceramides and PU phospholipids, which was consistently described in human HCC. Triacylglycerols declined in the cancer tissues, which is in accordance with a low expression of lipogenic enzymes in the tumors. Conclusions The LMCD model is suitable to study NASH associated lipid reprogramming. Hepatic lipid profile was modestly modified in the DEN injected mice suggesting a function of these derangements in carcinogenesis. Lipid composition of liver tumors did not resemble the human HCC lipidome, and most notably, lipogenesis and triacylglycerol levels were suppressed.

33343810/Critical Evaluation of the Interaction of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species with Blood to Inform the Clinical Translation of Nonthermal Plasma Therapy Non-thermal plasma (NTP), an ionized gas generated at ambient pressure and temperature, has been an emerging technology for medical applications. Through controlled delivery of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), NTP can elicit hormetic cellular responses, thus stimulating broad therapeutic effects. To enable clinical translation of the promising preclinical research into NTP therapy, a deeper understanding of NTP interactions with clinical substrates is profoundly needed. Since NTP-generated ROS/RNS will inevitably interact with blood in several clinical contexts, understanding their stability in this system is crucial. In this study, two medically relevant NTP delivery modalities were used to assess the stability of NTP-generated ROS/RNS in three aqueous solutions with increasing organic complexities: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blood plasma (BP), and processed whole blood. NTP-generated RNS collectively (NO2-, ONOO-), H2O2, and ONOO- exclusively were analyzed over time. We demonstrated that NTP-generated RNS and H2O2 were stable in PBS but scavenged by different components of the blood. While RNS remained stable in BP after initial scavenging effects, it was completely reduced in processed whole blood. On the other hand, H2O2 was completely scavenged in both liquids over time. Our previously developed luminescent probe europium(III) was used for precision measurement of ONOO- concentration. NTP-generated ONOO- was detected in all three liquids for up to at least 30 seconds, thus highlighting its therapeutic potential. Based on our results, we discussed the necessary considerations to choose the most optimal NTP modality for delivery of ROS/RNS to and via blood in the clinical context.
33298571/Amylases in the Human Vagina In this study, we show that multiple bacteria in the vaginal community produce amylases that hydrolyze glycogen into simpler sugars (i.e., maltose and maltotriose). These sugars serve as "common goods" that sustain bacterial populations in vaginal communities. ABSTRACT Dominance of Lactobacillus species in vaginal communities is a hallmark of healthy conditions in the female genital tract. Key nutrients for lactobacilli include sugars produced when glycogen is degraded by alpha-amylase in the vagina. While alpha-amylase activity has been demonstrated in vaginal fluids, it is unclear whether alpha-amylases are produced solely by the host, bacteria in the vagina, or both. We screened cervicovaginal mucus from 23 reproductive-age women, characterized the species composition of vaginal communities, measured vaginal pH, and determined levels of amylase activity, glycogen, and lactic acid. Based on differences in these measured variables, one sample from each of four individual donors was selected for metagenomic and proteomic analyses. Of eight putative bacterial amylases identified in the assembled bacterial metagenomes, we detected four in vaginal fluids. These amylases were produced by various bacteria in different vaginal communities. Moreover, no two communities were the same in terms of which bacteria were producing amylases. Although we detected bacterial amylases in vaginal fluids, there was no clear association between the bacterial species that was dominant in a community and the level of amylase activity. This association was likely masked by the presence of human alpha-amylase, which was also detected in vaginal fluids. Finally, the levels of amylase activity and glycogen were only weakly associated. Our findings show, for the first time, that multiple amylases from both bacterial and human origins can be present simultaneously in the vagina. This work also suggests that the link between glycogen, amylase, and Lactobacillus in the vagina is complex. IMPORTANCE In this study, we show that multiple bacteria in the vaginal community produce amylases that hydrolyze glycogen into simpler sugars (i.e., maltose and maltotriose). These sugars serve as "common goods" that sustain bacterial populations in vaginal communities. Given the temporal changes that are observed in the human vaginal microbiome, we expect the kinds of bacterial amylases produced will also vary over time. These differences influence the pool of resources that are broadly shared and shape the species composition of the vaginal bacterial community.
33298572/Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E2 Repression of TWIST1 Transcription Is a Potential Mediator of HPV16 Cancer Outcomes HPV16-positive cancers have a better clinical outcome that their non-HPV anatomical counterparts. Furthermore, the presence of HPV16 E2 RNA predicts a better outcome for HPV16-positive tumors; the reasons for this are not known. ABSTRACT Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causative agents in around 5% of all cancers, including cervical and oropharyngeal. A feature of HPV cancers is their better clinical outcome compared with non-HPV anatomical counterparts. In turn, the presence of E2 predicts a better clinical outcome in HPV-positive cancers; the reason(s) for the better outcome of E2-positive patients is not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that HPV16 E2 regulates host gene transcription that is relevant to the HPV16 life cycle in N/Tert-1 cells. One of the genes repressed by E2 and the entire HPV16 genome in N/Tert-1 cells is TWIST1. Here, we demonstrate that TWIST1 RNA levels are reduced in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative head and neck cancer and that E2 and HPV16 downregulate both TWIST1 RNA and protein in our N/Tert-1 model; E6/E7 cannot repress TWIST1. E2 represses the TWIST1 promoter in transient assays and is localized to the TWIST1 promoter; E2 also induces repressive epigenetic changes on the TWIST1 promoter. TWIST1 is a master transcriptional regulator of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and a high level of TWIST1 is a prognostic marker indicative of poor cancer outcomes. We demonstrate that TWIST1 target genes are also downregulated in E2-positive N/Tert-1 cells and that E2 promotes a failure in wound healing, a phenotype of low TWIST1 levels. We propose that the presence of E2 in HPV-positive tumors leads to TWIST1 repression and that this plays a role in the better clinical response of E2-positive HPV tumors. IMPORTANCE HPV16-positive cancers have a better clinical outcome that their non-HPV anatomical counterparts. Furthermore, the presence of HPV16 E2 RNA predicts a better outcome for HPV16-positive tumors; the reasons for this are not known. Here, we demonstrate that E2 represses expression of the TWIST1 gene; an elevated level of this gene is a marker of poor prognosis for a variety of cancers. We demonstrate that E2 directly binds to the TWIST1 promoter and actively represses transcription. TWIST1 is a master regulator promoting EMT, and here, we demonstrate that the presence of E2 reduces the ability of N/Tert-1 cells to wound heal. Overall, we propose that the E2 repression of TWIST1 may contribute to the better clinical outcome of E2-positive HPV16-positive tumors.
33298575/Hydrogen Peroxide Production by Streptococcus pneumoniae Results in Alpha-hemolysis by Oxidation of Oxy-hemoglobin to Met-hemoglobin There is a misconception that alpha-hemolysis observed on blood agar plate cultures of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-hemolytic streptococci is produced by a hemolysin or, alternatively, by lysis of erythrocytes caused by hydrogen peroxide. We noticed in the course of our investigations that wild-type S. pneumoniae strains and hemolysin (e.g., pneumolysin) knockout mutants produced the alpha-hemolytic halo on blood agar plates. ABSTRACT Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci produce a greenish halo on blood agar plates referred to as alpha-hemolysis. This phenotype is utilized by clinical microbiology laboratories to report culture findings of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, including S. pneumoniae, and other bacteria. The alpha-hemolysis halo on blood agar plates has been related to the hemolytic activity of pneumococcal pneumolysin (Ply) or, to a lesser extent, to lysis of erythrocytes by S. pneumoniae-produced hydrogen peroxide. We investigated the molecular basis of the alpha-hemolysis halo produced by S. pneumoniae. Wild-type strains TIGR4, D39, R6, and EF3030 and isogenic derivative Deltaply mutants produced similar alpha-hemolytic halos on blood agar plates, while cultures of hydrogen peroxide knockout DeltaspxB DeltalctO mutants lacked this characteristic halo. Moreover, in the presence of catalase, the alpha-hemolysis halo was absent in cultures of the wild-type (wt) and Deltaply mutant strains. Spectroscopic studies demonstrated that culture supernatants of TIGR4 released hemoglobin-bound heme (heme-hemoglobin) from erythrocytes and oxidized oxy-hemoglobin to met-hemoglobin within 30 min of incubation. As expected, given Ply hemolytic activity and that hydrogen peroxide contributes to the release of Ply, TIGR4Deltaply and DeltaspxB DeltalctO isogenic mutants had significantly decreased release of heme-hemoglobin from erythrocytes. However, TIGR4Deltaply that produces hydrogen peroxide oxidized oxy-hemoglobin to met-hemoglobin, whereas TIGR4DeltaspxB DeltalctO failed to produce oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin. Studies conducted with all other wt strains and isogenic mutants resulted in similar findings. We demonstrated that the so-called alpha-hemolysis halo is caused by the oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin (Fe+2) to a non-oxygen-binding met-hemoglobin (Fe+3) by S. pneumoniae-produced hydrogen peroxide. IMPORTANCE There is a misconception that alpha-hemolysis observed on blood agar plate cultures of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-hemolytic streptococci is produced by a hemolysin or, alternatively, by lysis of erythrocytes caused by hydrogen peroxide. We noticed in the course of our investigations that wild-type S. pneumoniae strains and hemolysin (e.g., pneumolysin) knockout mutants produced the alpha-hemolytic halo on blood agar plates. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide-defective mutants prepared in four different strains lacked the characteristic alpha-hemolysis halo. We also demonstrated that wild-type strains and pneumolysin mutants oxidized oxy-hemoglobin to met-hemoglobin. Hydrogen peroxide knockout mutants, however, failed to oxidize oxy-hemoglobin. Therefore, the greenish halo formed on cultures of S. pneumoniae and other so-called alpha-hemolytic streptococci is caused by the oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin produced by hydrogen peroxide. Oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin to the nonbinding oxygen form, met-hemoglobin, might occur in the lungs during pneumococcal pneumonia.
33302960/Expressing a cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to increase free fatty acid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Background Saccharomyces cerevisiae is being exploited as a cell factory to produce fatty acids and their derivatives as biofuels. Previous studies found that both precursor supply and fatty acid metabolism deregulation are essential for enhanced fatty acid synthesis. A bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex expressed in the yeast cytosol was reported to enable production of cytosolic acetyl-CoA with lower energy cost and no toxic intermediate. Results Overexpression of the PDH complex significantly increased cell growth, ethanol consumption and reduced glycerol accumulation. Furthermore, to optimize the redox imbalance in production of fatty acids from glucose, two endogenous NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases were deleted, and a heterologous NADP+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was introduced. The best fatty acid producing strain PDH7 with engineering of precursor and co-factor metabolism could produce 840.5 mg/L free fatty acids (FFAs) in shake flask, which was 83.2% higher than the control strain YJZ08. Profile analysis of free fatty acid suggested the cytosolic PDH complex mainly resulted in the increases of unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1 and C18:1). Conclusions We demonstrated that cytosolic PDH pathway enabled more efficient acetyl-CoA provision with the lower ATP cost, and improved FFA production. Together with engineering of the redox factor rebalance, the cytosolic PDH pathway could achieve high level of FFA production at similar levels of other best acetyl-CoA producing pathways.
33302968/Prevalence of Campylobacter species in human, animal and food of animal origin and their antimicrobial susceptibility in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli accounts for most cases of human gastrointestinal infections. The infection occurs through ingestion of contaminated food or water, and direct contact with feces of infected animal or human. Regardless of few local reports of Campylobacter and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile, there is no comprehensive data that show the burden of Campylobacter infection at national level in Ethiopia. This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of Campylobacter and its resistance patterns in Ethiopia from different sources. Method A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Google scholar, Science direct and Google engine search was conducted for studies published from 2000 to July 30, 2020 on prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter in human, animal and food. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Checklist. Data from articles was extracted using a standardized data extraction format. The quality of the studies was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The Q test and I2 test statistic were used to test heterogeneity across studies. The Pooled estimate of prevalence of Campylobacter species and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile was computed by a random effects model using STATA 16.0 software. Results were presented in forest plot, tables, funnel plot and figures with 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 291 articles were retrieved initially. The pooled prevalence of Campylobacter species from different sources was 10.2% (95% CI 3.79, 16.51). In this meta-analysis, the lowest prevalence was 6.0% whereas the highest prevalence was 72.7%. In the sub-group analysis, the pooled prevalence was similar in Amhara and Oromia region, higher in Gambella and lower in Sidama. Prevalence of Campylobacter was higher in animals (14.6%) compared to humans (9%). The pooled antimicrobial resistance rates of Campylobacter species to different antimicrobials ranged from 2.9-100%. Overall, higher rate of resistance was to cephalothin (67.2%), gentamicin (67.2%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33.3%) in Campylobacter isolates from all sources. In isolates from human, resistance to cephalothin was 83% followed by amoxicillin (80%), amoxicillin-clavulnate (36%), trimethoprim-sulfamethpxazole (32%), clindamycin (31%) and ceftriaxone (28%). On the other hand, higher rate of resistance to penicillin (100%), cephalothin (60%), ciprofloxacin (71.2%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (39%) was recorded in isolates from animals. Conclusion The present study highlights the burden of Campylobacter species in the country and higher rate of resistance among investigated isolates. Designing appropriate prevention strategies and further local in-depth studies are recommended to establish actual epidemiological burden of the bacteria in the country.
33302870/Combined proteomics, metabolomics and physiological analyses of rice growth and grain yield with heavy nitrogen application before and after drought Background Nitrogen application can effectively mitigate the damage to crop growth and yield caused by drought. However, the efficiency of heavy nitrogen application before drought (NBD) and heavy nitrogen application after drought (NAD) to regulate rice response to drought stress remains controversial. In this study, we profiled physiology, proteomics and metabolomics in rice variety Wufengyou 286 of two nitrogen management modes (NBD and NAD) to investigate their yield formation and the mechanism of nitrogen regulation for drought resistance. Results Results revealed that the yield of NBD and NAD decreased significantly when it was subjected to drought stress at the stage of young panicle differentiation, while the yield of NBD was 33.85 and 36.33% higher than that of NAD in 2017 and 2018, reaching significant levels. Under drought conditions, NBD increased chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate in leaves, significantly improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase and catalase, and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared with NAD. NBD promoted nitrogen assimilation in leaves, which was characterized by increased activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS). In addition, NBD significantly increased the contents of osmotic regulatory substances such as soluble sugar, soluble protein and free proline. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis of 234 differentially expressed proteins and 518 differential metabolites showed that different nitrogen management induced strong changes in photosynthesis pathway, energy metabolism pathway, nitrogen metabolism and oxidation-reduction pathways. Conclusion Different nitrogen management methods have significant differences in drought resistance of rice. These results suggest that heavy nitrogen application before drought may be an important pathway to improve the yield and stress resistance of rice, and provide a new ecological perspective on nitrogen regulation in rice.

33302873/Investigation of the role of AcTPR2 in kiwifruit and its response to Botrytis cinerea infection Background Elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of kiwifruit response to gray mold disease caused by Botrytis cinerea can provide the basis for its molecular breeding to impart resistance against this disease. In this study, 'Hongyang' kiwifruit served as the experimental material; the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) co-repressor gene AcTPR2 was cloned into a pTRV2 vector (AcTPR2-TRV) and the virus-induced gene silencing technique was used to establish the functions of the AcTPR2 gene in kiwifruit resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Results Virus-induced silencing of AcTPR2 enhanced the susceptibility of kiwifruit to Botrytis cinerea. Defensive enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and endogenous phytohormones such as indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA3), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA) were detected. Kiwifruit activated these enzymes and endogenous phytohormones in response to pathogen-induced stress and injury. The expression levels of the IAA signaling genes:AcNIT, AcARF1, and AcARF2:were higher in the AcTPR2-TRV treatment group than in the control. The IAA levels were higher and the rot phenotype was more severe in AcTPR2-TRV kiwifruits than that in the control. These results suggested that AcTPR2 downregulation promotes expression of IAA and IAA signaling genes and accelerates postharvest kiwifruit senescence. Further, Botrytis cinerea dramatically upregulated AcTPR2, indicating that AcTPR2 augments kiwifruit defense against pathogens by downregulating the IAA and IAA signaling genes. Conclusions The results of the present study could help clarify the regulatory mechanisms of disease resistance in kiwifruit and furnish genetic resources for molecular breeding of kiwifruit disease resistance.

33302999/Loss of HER2 and decreased T-DM1 efficacy in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer treated with dual HER2 blockade: the SePHER Study Background HER2-targeting agents have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape of HER2+ advanced breast cancer (ABC). Within a short time frame, the rapid introduction of new therapeutics has led to the approval of pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab and a taxane in first-line, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in second-line. Thereby, evidence of T-DM1 efficacy following trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination is limited, with data from some retrospective reports suggesting lower activity. The purpose of the present study is to investigate T-DM1 efficacy in pertuzumab-pretreated and pertuzumab naive HER2 positive ABC patients. We also aimed to provide evidence on the exposure to different drugs sequences including pertuzumab and T-DM1 in HER2 positive cell lines. Methods The biology of HER2 was investigated in vitro through sequential exposure of resistant HER2 + breast cancer cell lines to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and their combination. In vitro experiments were paralleled by the analysis of data from 555 HER2 + ABC patients treated with T-DM1 and evaluation of T-DM1 efficacy in the 371 patients who received it in second line. Survival estimates were graphically displayed in Kaplan Meier curves, compared by log rank test and, when possibile, confirmed in multivariate models. Results We herein show evidence of lower activity of T-DM1 in two HER2+ breast cancer cell lines resistant to trastuzumab+pertuzumab, as compared to trastuzumab-resistant cells. Lower T-DM1 efficacy was associated with a marked reduction of HER2 expression on the cell membrane and its nuclear translocation. HER2 downregulation at the membrane level was confirmed in biopsies of four trastuzumab/pertuzumab-pretreated patients. Among the 371 patients treated with second-line T-DM1, median overall survival (mOS) from diagnosis of advanced disease and median progression-free survival to second-line treatment (mPFS2) were 52 and 6 months in 177 patients who received trastuzumab/pertuzumab in first-line, and 74 and 10 months in 194 pertuzumab-naive patients (p = 0.0006 and 0.03 for OS and PFS2, respectively). Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab reduces the amount of available plasma membrane HER2 receptor, limiting the binding of T-DM1 in cancer cells. This may help interpret the less favorable outcomes of second-line T-DM1 in trastuzumab/pertuzumab pre-treated patients compared to their pertuzumab-naive counterpart.

33343809/Melatonin Suppresses Ferroptosis Induced by High Glucose via Activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway in Type 2 Diabetic Osteoporosis Ferroptosis is recently identified, an iron- and reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) dependent form of regulated cell death. This study was designed to determine the existence of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetic osteoporosis and confirm that melatonin can inhibit the ferroptosis of osteoblasts through activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to improve bone microstructure in vivo and in vitro. We treated MC3T3-E1 cells with different concentrations of melatonin (1, 10, or 100 muM) and exposed them to high glucose (25.5 mM) for 48 h in vitro. Our data showed that high glucose can induce osteoblast cytotoxicity and the accumulation of lipid peroxide, the mitochondria of osteoblast show the same morphology changes as the erastin treatment group, and the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and cystine-glutamate antiporter (SLC7A11) is downregulated, but these effects were reversed by ferroptosis inhibitor ferrastatin-1 and iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO). Furthermore, western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1); osteogenic capacity was evaluated by alizarin red S staining and the expression of osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase; the results showed that the expression levels of these proteins in osteoblasts with 1, 10, or 100 muM melatonins were significantly higher than the high glucose group, but after using Nrf2-SiRNA interference, the therapeutic effect of melatonin was significantly inhibited. We also performed in vivo experiments in a diabetic rat model treated with two concentrations of melatonin (10, 50 mg/kg). Dynamic bone histomorphometry and micro-CT were used to observe the rat bone microstructure, and the expression of GPX4 and Nrf2 was determined by immunohistochemistry. Here, we first report that high glucose induces ferroptosis via increased ROS/lipid peroxidation/glutathione depletion in type 2 diabetic osteoporosis. More importantly, melatonin significantly reduced the level of ferroptosis and improved the osteogenic capacity of MC3T3-E1 through activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in vivo and in vitro.
33343802/Induction of HO-1 by 5, 8-Dihydroxy-4',7-Dimethoxyflavone via Activation of ROS/p38 MAPK/Nrf2 Attenuates Thrombin-Induced Connective Tissue Growth Factor Expression in Human Cardiac Fibroblasts Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to exert as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzyme in cardiovascular inflammatory diseases. Flavonoids have been demonstrated to display anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects through the induction of HO-1. 5,8-Dihydroxy-4',7-dimethoxyflavone (DDF), one of the flavonoid compounds, is isolated from Reevesia formosana. Whether DDF induced HO-1 expression on human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) remained unknown. Here, we found that DDF time- and concentration-dependently induced HO-1 protein and mRNA expression, which was attenuated by pretreatment with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in HCFs. DDF-enhanced ROS generation was attenuated by NAC, but not by either diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI, Nox inhibitor) or MitoTempol (mitochondrial ROS scavenger). Interestingly, pretreatment with glutathione (GSH) inhibited DDF-induced HO-1 expression. The ratio of GSH/GSSG was time-dependently decreased in DDF-treated HCFs. DDF-induced HO-1 expression was attenuated by an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (p38i VIII) or siRNA, but not by MEK1/2 (PD98059) or JNK1/2 (SP600125). DDF-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation was inhibited by GSH or p38i VIII. Moreover, DDF-induced HO-1 expression was mediated through Nrf2 phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus which was attenuated by NAC or p38 siRNA. DDF also stimulated antioxidant response element (ARE) promoter activity which was inhibited by NAC, GSH, or p38i VIII. Interaction between Nrf2 and the ARE-binding sites on the HO-1 promoter was revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, which was attenuated by NAC, GSH, or p38i VIII. We further evaluated the functional effect of HO-1 expression on the thrombin-induced fibrotic responses. Our result indicated that the induction of HO-1 by DDF can attenuate the thrombin-induced connective tissue growth factor expression. These results suggested that DDF-induced HO-1 expression is, at least, mediated through the activation of the ROS-dependent p38 MAPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway in HCFs. Thus, the upregulation of HO-1 by DDF could be a candidate for the treatment of heart fibrosis.
33343805/The Crosstalk between Calcium Ions and Aldosterone Contributes to Inflammation, Apoptosis, and Calcification of VSMC via the AIF-1/NF-kappaB Pathway in Uremia Vascular calcification is a major complication of maintenance hemodialysis patients. Studies have confirmed that calcification mainly occurs in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of the vascular media. However, the exact pathogenesis of VSMC calcification is still unknown. This study shows that the crosstalk between calcium and aldosterone via the allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) pathway contributes to calcium homeostasis and VSMC calcification, which is a novel mechanism of vascular calcification in uremia. In vivo results showed that the level of aldosterone and inflammatory factors increased in calcified arteries, whereas no significant changes were observed in peripheral blood. However, the expression of inflammatory factors markedly increased in the peripheral blood of uremic rats without aortic calcification and gradually returned to normal levels with aggravation of aortic calcification. In vitro results showed that there was an interaction between calcium ions and aldosterone in macrophages or VSMC. Calcium induced aldosterone synthesis, and in turn, aldosterone also triggered intracellular calcium content upregulation in macrophages or VSMC. Furthermore, activated macrophages induced inflammation, apoptosis, and calcification of VSMC. Activated VSMC also imparted a similar effect on untreated VSMC. Finally, AIF-1 enhanced aldosterone- or calcium-induced VSMC calcification, and NF-kappaB inhibitors inhibited the effect of AIF-1 on VSMC. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that the crosstalk between calcium ions and aldosterone plays an important role in VSMC calcification in uremia via the AIF-1/NF-kappaB pathway. Local calcified VSMC induced the same pathological process in surrounding VSMC, thereby contributing to calcium homeostasis and accelerating vascular calcification.
33343230/Investigation of Cytotoxicity, Oxidative Stress, and Inflammatory Responses of Tantalum Nanoparticles in THP-1-Derived Macrophages Tantalum (Ta) is gaining attention as a biomaterial in bone tissue engineering. Although the clinical advantage of Ta-based implants for primary and revision total joint replacement (TJA) has been well documented, few studies investigated the effect of wear products of Ta implants on peri-implant cells, and their potential contribution to aseptic implant loosening. This study is aimed at examining the cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory potential of Ta and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on macrophages in vitro. NPs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and energy-dispersive X-ray. To test the NP-mediated cellular response in macrophages, THP-1-derived macrophages were challenged with both NPs, and cytotoxicity was analyzed using CCK-8 and LDH assays. Flow cytometry was used to investigate particle uptake and their internalization routes. NP-mediated oxidative stress was investigated by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species, and their proinflammatory potential was determined by quantifying the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta in cell culture supernatants using ELISA. We found that both Ta and TiO2 NPs were taken up through actin-dependent phagocytosis, although TiO2 NPs did also show some involvement of macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Ta NPs caused no apparent toxicity, while TiO2 NPs demonstrated significant cytotoxicity at a concentration of over 100mug/mL at 24 h. Ta NPs induced negligible ROS generation and proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta) in macrophages. In contrast, TiO2 NPs markedly induced these effects in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that Ta NPs are inert, nontoxic, and noninflammatory. Therefore, Ta could be considered an excellent biomaterial in primary and revision joint arthroplasty implants.
33308195/Cardioprotective effects of polydatin against myocardial injury in diabetic rats via inhibition of NADPH oxidase and NF-kappaB activities Background Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a main cause of the increased morbidity in diabetic patients, no effective treatment is available so far. Polydatin, a resveratrol glucoside isolated from the Polygonum cuspidatum, was found by our and others have antioxidant and cardioprotective activities. Therapeutic effects of polydatin on diabetic cardiomyopathy and the possible mechanisms remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of polydatin on myocardial injury induced by hyperglycemia. Methods Diabetes in rats was made by high-fat diet combined with multiple low doses of streptozotocin, and then treated with polydatin (100 mg kg-1 day-1, by gavage) for 8 weeks. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography. Myocardial tissue and blood samples were collected for histology, protein and metabolic characteristics analysis. In cultured H9c2 cells with 30 mM of glucose, the direct effects of polydatin on myocyte injury were also observed. Results In diabetic rats, polydatin administration significantly improved myocardial dysfunction and attenuated histological abnormalities, as evidenced by elevating left ventricular shortening fraction and ejection fraction, as well as reducing cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. In cultured H9c2 cells, pretreatment of polydatin dose-dependently inhibited high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Further observation evidenced that polydatin suppressed the increase in the reactive oxygen species levels, NADPH oxidase activity and inflammatory cytokines production induced by hyperglycemia in vivo and in vitro. Polydatin also prevented the increase expression of NOX4, NOX2 and NF-kappaB in the high glucose -stimulated H9c2 cells and diabetic hearts. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the cardioprotective effect of polydatin against hyperglycemia-induced myocardial injury is mediated by inhibition of NADPH oxidase and NF-kappaB activity. The findings may provide a novel understanding the mechanisms of the polydatin to be a potential treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

33308177/Climate change causes changes in biochemical markers of kidney disease Background Climate change is a significant threat to the health of the Ghanaian people. Evidence abounds in Ghana that temperatures in all the ecological zones are rising, whereas rainfall levels have been generally reducing and patterns are increasingly becoming erratic. The study estimated the impact of climate variation between seasons on biochemical markers of kidney disease. Methods This study conveniently recruited 50 apparently healthy peasant farmers and hawkers at Wa in the Upper West Region of Ghana. A pre-study screening for hepatitis A and C, Diabetes mellitus, hypertension was done. Serum creatinine and urea levels were analyzed to rule out kidney preexisting kidney disease. Baseline data was collected by estimating urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) as well as for hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) concentrations. Anthropometric data such as height, weight and blood pressure were measured by trained personnel. The study participants were closely followed and alerted deep in the dry season for the second sampling (urea, creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood pressure, anthropometry). Results This study recruited more males (58.82%) than females (41.15%), majority (52.92%) of which were aged 25-29 years with the youngest being 22 years and the eldest being 35 years. The study found body mass index (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.019), creatinine (p < 0.001), urea (p = 0.013) and eGFR (p < 0.001) to be significantly influenced by climate change. Stage 1 hypertension was predominant among the study participants during the dry season, 8 (15.69%) than was observed during the rainy season, 4 (7.84%) nonetheless the number of participants with normal BMI rose from 49.02% in the rainy season to 62.75% during the dry reason. Additionally, the study observed that the impact of climate change on systolic blood pressure and urea varied based on age and sex. Conclusion This study revealed that climatic changes cause variations in various biochemical parameters used to assess kidney function. Public health education on climatic changes and its implication including precautionary measures should be done among inhabitants of Wa and its environs to reduce its effect. Additionally, appropriate dietary patterns should also be advised to avoid the development of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and obesity that are known principal causes of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
33308236/Engineering the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and hydrogen utilization pathway of Ralstonia eutropha for improved autotrophic growth and polyhydroxybutyrate production Background CO2 is fixed by all living organisms with an autotrophic metabolism, among which the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle is the most important and widespread carbon fixation pathway. Thus, studying and engineering the CBB cycle with the associated energy providing pathways to increase the CO2 fixation efficiency of cells is an important subject of biological research with significant application potential. Results In this work, the autotrophic microbe Ralstonia eutropha (Cupriavidus necator) was selected as a research platform for CBB cycle optimization engineering. By knocking out either CBB operon genes on the operon or mega-plasmid of R. eutropha, we found that both CBB operons were active and contributed almost equally to the carbon fixation process. With similar knock-out experiments, we found both soluble and membrane-bound hydrogenases (SH and MBH), belonging to the energy providing hydrogenase module, were functional during autotrophic growth of R. eutropha. SH played a more significant role. By introducing a heterologous cyanobacterial RuBisCO with the endogenous GroES/EL chaperone system(A quality control systems for proteins consisting of molecular chaperones and proteases, which prevent protein aggregation by either refolding or degrading misfolded proteins) and RbcX(A chaperone in the folding of Rubisco), the culture OD600 of engineered strain increased 89.2% after 72 h of autotrophic growth, although the difference was decreased at 96 h, indicating cyanobacterial RuBisCO with a higher activity was functional in R. eutropha and lead to improved growth in comparison to the host specific enzyme. Meanwhile, expression of hydrogenases was optimized by modulating the expression of MBH and SH, which could further increase the R. eutropha H16 culture OD600 to 93.4% at 72 h. Moreover, the autotrophic yield of its major industrially relevant product, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), was increased by 99.7%. Conclusions To our best knowledge, this is the first report of successfully engineering the CBB pathway and hydrogenases of R. eutropha for improved activity, and is one of only a few cases where the efficiency of CO2 assimilation pathway was improved. Our work demonstrates that R. eutropha is a useful platform for studying and engineering the CBB for applications.
33262257/Expansion of a Specific Plasmodium falciparum PfMDR1 Haplotype in Southeast Asia with Increased Substrate Transport Global efforts to eliminate malaria depend on the continued success of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) that target Plasmodium asexual blood-stage parasites. Resistance to ACTs, however, has emerged, creating the need to define the underlying mechanisms. Mutations in the P. falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 (PfMDR1) transporter constitute an important determinant of resistance. Applying gene editing tools combined with an analysis of a public database containing thousands of parasite genomes, we show geographic selection and expansion of a pfmdr1 gene amplification encoding the N86/184F haplotype in Southeast Asia. Parasites expressing this PfMDR1 variant possess a higher transport capacity that modulates their responses to antimalarials. These data could help tailor and optimize antimalarial drug usage in different regions where malaria is endemic by taking into account the regional prevalence of pfmdr1 polymorphisms. ABSTRACT Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been vital in reducing malaria mortality rates since the 2000s. Their efficacy, however, is threatened by the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia. The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 (PfMDR1) transporter plays a central role in parasite resistance to ACT partner drugs through gene copy number variations (CNV) and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using genomic epidemiology, we show that multiple pfmdr1 copies encoding the N86 and 184F haplotype are prevalent across Southeast Asia. Applying genome editing tools on the Southeast Asian Dd2 strain and using a surrogate assay to measure transporter activity in infected red blood cells, we demonstrate that parasites harboring multicopy N86/184F PfMDR1 have a higher Fluo-4 transport capacity compared with those expressing the wild-type N86/Y184 haplotype. Multicopy N86/184F PfMDR1 is also associated with decreased parasite susceptibility to lumefantrine. These findings provide evidence of the geographic selection and expansion of specific multicopy PfMDR1 haplotypes associated with multidrug resistance in Southeast Asia.
33293380/Identification of a Novel Cobamide Remodeling Enzyme in the Beneficial Human Gut Bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila Cobamides, comprising the vitamin B12 family of cobalt-containing cofactors, are required for metabolism in all domains of life, including most bacteria. Cobamides have structural variability in the lower ligand, and selectivity for particular cobamides has been observed in most organisms studied to date. ABSTRACT The beneficial human gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila provides metabolites to other members of the gut microbiota by breaking down host mucin, but most of its other metabolic functions have not been investigated. A. muciniphila strain MucT is known to use cobamides, the vitamin B12 family of cofactors with structural diversity in the lower ligand. However, A. muciniphila MucT is unable to synthesize cobamides de novo, and the specific forms that can be used by A. muciniphila have not been examined. We found that the levels of growth of A. muciniphila MucT were nearly identical with each of seven cobamides tested, in contrast to nearly all bacteria that had been studied previously. Unexpectedly, this promiscuity is due to cobamide remodeling:the removal and replacement of the lower ligand:despite the absence of the canonical remodeling enzyme CbiZ in A. muciniphila. We identified a novel enzyme, CbiR, that is capable of initiating the remodeling process by hydrolyzing the phosphoribosyl bond in the nucleotide loop of cobamides. CbiR does not share similarity with other cobamide remodeling enzymes or B12-binding domains and is instead a member of the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 2 enzyme superfamily. We speculate that CbiR enables bacteria to repurpose cobamides that they cannot otherwise use in order to grow under cobamide-requiring conditions; this function was confirmed by heterologous expression of cbiR in Escherichia coli. Homologs of CbiR are found in over 200 microbial taxa across 22 phyla, suggesting that many bacteria may use CbiR to gain access to the diverse cobamides present in their environment.
33262259/Role of Glutathione in Buffering Excess Intracellular Copper in Streptococcus pyogenes The control of intracellular metal availability is fundamental to bacterial physiology. In the case of copper (Cu), it has been established that rising intracellular Cu levels eventually fill the metal-sensing site of the endogenous Cu-sensing transcriptional regulator, which in turn induces transcription of a copper export pump. This response caps intracellular Cu availability below a well-defined threshold and prevents Cu toxicity. Glutathione, abundant in many bacteria, is known to bind Cu and has long been assumed to contribute to bacterial Cu handling. However, there is some ambiguity since neither its biosynthesis nor uptake is Cu-regulated. Furthermore, there is little experimental support for this physiological role of glutathione beyond measuring growth of glutathione-deficient mutants in the presence of Cu. Our work with group A Streptococcus provides new evidence that glutathione increases the threshold of intracellular Cu availability that can be tolerated by bacteria and thus advances fundamental understanding of bacterial Cu handling. ABSTRACT Copper (Cu) is an essential metal for bacterial physiology but in excess it is bacteriotoxic. To limit Cu levels in the cytoplasm, most bacteria possess a transcriptionally responsive system for Cu export. In the Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]), this system is encoded by the copYAZ operon. This study demonstrates that although the site of GAS infection represents a Cu-rich environment, inactivation of the copA Cu efflux gene does not reduce virulence in a mouse model of invasive disease. In vitro, Cu treatment leads to multiple observable phenotypes, including defects in growth and viability, decreased fermentation, inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) activity, and misregulation of metal homeostasis, likely as a consequence of mismetalation of noncognate metal-binding sites by Cu. Surprisingly, the onset of these effects is delayed by ~4 h even though expression of copZ is upregulated immediately upon exposure to Cu. Further biochemical investigations show that the onset of all phenotypes coincides with depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH). Supplementation with extracellular GSH replenishes the intracellular pool of this thiol and suppresses all the observable effects of Cu treatment. These results indicate that GSH buffers excess intracellular Cu when the transcriptionally responsive Cu export system is overwhelmed. Thus, while the copYAZ operon is responsible for Cu homeostasis, GSH has a role in Cu tolerance and allows bacteria to maintain metabolism even in the presence of an excess of this metal ion.
33262260/The Host Cell Metabolite Inositol Hexakisphosphate Promotes Efficient Endogenous HIV-1 Reverse Transcription by Stabilizing the Viral Capsid HIV-1 infection requires reverse transcription of the viral genome. While much is known about the biochemistry of reverse transcription from simplified biochemical reactions, reverse transcription during infection takes place within a viral core. However, endogenous reverse transcription reactions using permeabilized HIV-1 virions or purified viral cores have been inefficient. Using viral cores purified from infectious HIV-1 particles, we show that efficient reverse transcription is achieved in vitro by addition of the capsid-stabilizing metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate. The enhancement of reverse transcription was linked to the capsid-stabilizing effect of the compound, consistent with the known requirement for an intact or semi-intact viral capsid for HIV-1 infection. Our results establish a biologically relevant system for dissecting the function of the viral capsid and its disassembly during reverse transcription. The system should also prove useful for mechanistic studies of capsid-targeting antiviral drugs. ABSTRACT A defining activity of retroviruses is reverse transcription, the process by which the viral genomic RNA is converted into the double-stranded DNA required for virus replication. Reverse transcriptase (RT), the viral enzyme responsible for this process, was identified in 1970 by assaying permeabilized retrovirus particles for DNA synthesis in vitro. Such reactions are inefficient, with only a small fraction of viral genomes being converted to full-length double-stranded DNA molecules, possibly owing to disruption of the structure of the viral core. Here, we show that reverse transcription in purified HIV-1 cores is enhanced by the addition of the capsid-binding host cell metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). IP6 potently enhanced full-length minus-strand synthesis, as did hexacarboxybenzene (HCB), which also stabilizes the HIV-1 capsid. Both IP6 and HCB stabilized the association of the viral CA and RT proteins with HIV-1 cores. In contrast to the wild type, cores isolated from mutant HIV-1 particles containing intrinsically hyperstable capsids exhibited relatively efficient reverse transcription in the absence of IP6, further indicating that the compound promotes reverse transcription by stabilizing the viral capsid. We also observed that the capsid-destabilizing antiviral compound PF74 inhibited endogenous reverse transcription with a potency that mirrors its ability to inhibit reverse transcription during infection. Our results show that the stabilization of the HIV-1 capsid permits efficient reverse transcription in HIV-1 cores, providing a sensitive experimental system for analyzing the functions of viral and host cell molecules and the role of capsid disassembly (uncoating) in the process.
33293381/The Key Glycolytic Enzyme Phosphofructokinase Is Involved in Resistance to Antiplasmodial Glycosides Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, continues to be a devastating global health issue, causing 405,000 deaths and 228 million cases in 2018. Understanding key metabolic processes in malaria parasites is critical to the development of new drugs to combat this major infectious disease. The Plasmodium glycolytic pathway is essential to the malaria parasite, providing energy for growth and replication and supplying important biomolecules for other essential Plasmodium anabolic pathways. Despite this overreliance on glycolysis, no current drugs target glycolysis, and there is a paucity of information on critical glycolysis targets. Our work addresses this unmet need, providing new mechanistic insights into this key pathway. ABSTRACT Plasmodium parasites rely heavily on glycolysis for ATP production and for precursors for essential anabolic pathways, such as the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here, we show that mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (PfPFK9), are associated with in vitro resistance to a primary sulfonamide glycoside (PS-3). Flux through the upper glycolysis pathway was significantly reduced in PS-3-resistant parasites, which was associated with reduced ATP levels but increased flux into the pentose phosphate pathway. PS-3 may directly or indirectly target enzymes in these pathways, as PS-3-treated parasites had elevated levels of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. PS-3 resistance also led to reduced MEP pathway intermediates, and PS-3-resistant parasites were hypersensitive to the MEP pathway inhibitor, fosmidomycin. Overall, this study suggests that PS-3 disrupts core pathways in central carbon metabolism, which is compensated for by mutations in PfPFK9, highlighting a novel metabolic drug resistance mechanism in P. falciparum.
33293382/Comprehensive Genomic Investigation of Adaptive Mutations Driving the Low-Level Oxacillin Resistance Phenotype in Staphylococcus aureus The majority of Staphylococcus aureus strains causing human disease are methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and can be treated with antistaphylococcal penicillins (such as oxacillin). While acquisition of the mec gene represents the main resistance mechanism to oxacillin, S. aureus can acquire low-level resistance through adaptive mutations in other genes. In this study, we used genomic approaches to understand the basis of S. aureus adaption to oxacillin and its dynamic at the population level. By combining a genome analysis of clinical isolates from persistent MSSA infections, in vitro selection of oxacillin resistance, and genome-wide association analysis on a large collection of isolates, we identified 21 genes linked to secondary oxacillin resistance. Adaptive mutations in these genes were easy to select when S. aureus was exposed to oxacillin, but they also came at a substantial cost in terms of bacterial fitness, suggesting that this phenotype emerges preferentially in the setting of sustained antibiotic exposure. ABSTRACT Antistaphylococcal penicillins such as oxacillin are the key antibiotics in the treatment of invasive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections; however, mec gene-independent resistance adaptation can cause treatment failure. Despite its clinical relevance, the basis of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the genomic adaptation to oxacillin at an unprecedented scale using a large collection of 503 clinical mec-negative isolates and 30 in vitro-adapted isolates from independent oxacillin exposures. By combining comparative genomics, evolutionary convergence, and genome-wide association analysis, we found 21 genetic loci associated with low-level oxacillin resistance, underscoring the polygenic nature of this phenotype. Evidence of adaptation was particularly strong for the c-di-AMP signal transduction pathways (gdpP and dacA) and in the clpXP chaperone-protease complex. The role of mutations in gdpP in conferring low-level oxacillin resistance was confirmed by allele-swapping experiments. We found that resistance to oxacillin emerges at high frequency in vitro (median, 2.9 x 10-6; interquartile range [IQR], 1.9 x 10-6 to 3.9 x 10-6), which is consistent with a recurrent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increase across the global phylogeny of clinical isolates. Nevertheless, adaptation in clinical isolates appears sporadically, with no stably adapted lineages, suggesting a high fitness cost of resistance, confirmed by growth assessment of mutants in rich media. Our data provide a broader understanding of the emergence and dynamics of oxacillin resistance adaptation in S. aureus and a framework for future surveillance of this clinically important phenomenon.
33262261/Systematic Analysis of c-di-GMP Signaling Mechanisms and Biological Functions in Dickeya zeae EC1 Dickeya zeae is the etiological agent of bacterial foot rot disease, which can cause massive economic losses in banana and rice plantations. Genome sequence analysis showed that D. zeae strain EC1 contains multiple c-di-GMP turnover genes, but their roles and regulatory mechanisms in bacterial physiology and virulence remain vague. By generating consecutive in-frame deletion mutants of the genes encoding c-di-GMP biosynthesis and degradation, respectively, we analyzed the individual and collective impacts of these c-di-GMP metabolic genes on the c-di-GMP global pool, bacterial physiology, and virulence. The significance of our study is in identifying the mechanism of c-di-GMP signaling in strain EC1 more clearly, which expands the c-di-GMP regulating patterns in Gram-negative species. The methods and experimental designs in this research will provide a valuable reference for the exploration of the complex c-di-GMP regulation mechanisms in other bacteria. ABSTRACT Dickeya zeae is an important and aggressive bacterial phytopathogen that can cause substantial economic losses in banana and rice plantations. We previously showed that c-di-GMP signaling proteins (cyclases/phosphodiesterases) in D. zeae strain EC1 play a significant role in the bacterial sessile-to-motile transition. To determine whether there is any synergistic effect among these c-di-GMP signaling proteins, we prepared a series of mutant strains by generating consecutive in-frame deletions of the genes encoding diguanylate cyclases (which make c-di-GMP) and phosphodiesterases (which break down c-di-GMP), respectively, using EC1 as a parental strain. The results showed that the complete deletion of all the putative diguanylate cyclases resulted in significantly increased bacterial motility and abrogated biofilm formation but did not appear to affect pathogenicity and virulence factor production. In contrast, the deletion of all the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase genes disabled motility and prevented the invasion of EC1 into rice seeds. By measuring the c-di-GMP concentrations and swimming motility of all the mutants, we propose that c-di-GMP controlled swimming behavior through a multitiered program in a c-di-GMP concentration-dependent manner, which could be described as an L-shaped regression curve. These features are quite different from those that have been shown for other bacterial species such as Salmonella and Caulobacter crescentus. Further analysis identified three c-di-GMP signaling proteins, i.e., PDE10355, DGC14945, and PDE14950, that play dominant roles in influencing the global c-di-GMP pool of strain EC1. The findings from this study highlight the complexity and plasticity of c-di-GMP regulatory circuits in different bacterial species.
33317606/Loss of exosomal miR-146a-5p from cancer-associated fibroblasts after androgen deprivation therapy contributes to prostate cancer metastasis Background Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the backbone of therapy for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Despite the good initial response, castration resistance and metastatic progression will inevitably occur. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may be implicated in promoting metastasis of PCa after ADT. Our aim is to investigate the role and mechanism of CAFs-derived exosomes involving in metastasis of PCa after ADT. Methods PCa cells were co-cultured with exosomes derived from 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated (simulating the high androgen level of prostate cancer microenvironment) or ethanol (ETOH) -treated (simulating the castration level of prostate cancer microenvironment after ADT) CAFs, and their migration and invasion differences under castration condition were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The miRNA profiles of exosomes derived from DHT-treated CAFs and matched ETOH-treated CAFs were analysed via next generation sequencing. The transfer of exosomal miR-146a-5p from CAFs to PCa cells was identified by fluorescent microscopy. The function and direct target gene of exosomal miR-146a-5p in PCa cells were confirmed through Transwell assays, luciferase reporter, and western blot. Results Compared with DHT-treated CAFs, exosomes derived from ETOH-treated CAFs dramatically increased migration and invasion of PCa cells under castration condition. MiR-146a-5p level in exosomes from ETOH-treated CAFs was significantly reduced. The loss of miR-146a-5p may strengthen the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to accelerate cancer cells metastasis by modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK pathway. Conclusions CAFs-derived exosomal miR-146a-5p confers metastasis in PCa cells under ADT through the EGFR/ERK pathway and it may present a new treatment for PCa.
33354159/Effects of Dietary Histidine on Growth Performance, Serum Amino Acids, and Intestinal Morphology and Microbiota Communities in Low Protein Diet-Fed Piglets Previous study showed that low protein diet-fed pigs are characterized by lower histidine concentration in the serum and muscle, suggesting that histidine may involve in protein-restricted response. Thus, the current study mainly investigated the effects of dietary histidine on growth performance, blood biochemical parameters and amino acids, intestinal morphology, and microbiota communities in low protein diet-challenged-piglets. The results showed that protein restriction inhibited growth performance, blood biochemical parameters and amino acids, and gut microbiota but had little effect on intestinal morphology. Dietary supplementation with histidine markedly enhanced serum histidine level and restored tryptophan concentration in low protein diet-fed piglets, while growth performance and intestinal morphology were not markedly altered in histidine-treated piglets. In addition, histidine exposure failed to affect bacterial diversity (observed species, Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, ACE, and phylogenetic diversity), but histidine-treated piglets exhibited higher abundances of Butyrivibrio and Bacteroides compared with the control and protein-restricted piglets. In conclusion, dietary histidine in low protein diet enhanced histidine concentration and affected gut microbiota (Butyrivibrio and Bacteroides) but failed to improve growth performance and intestinal morphology.
33354279/Topical Application of Fibroblast Growth Factor 10-PLGA Microsphere Accelerates Wound Healing via Inhibition of ER Stress There is a high incidence of acute and chronic skin defects caused by various reasons in clinically practice. The repair and functional reconstruction of skin defects have become a major clinical problem, which needs to be solved urgently. Previous studies have shown that fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) plays a functional role in promoting the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of epithelial cells. However, little is known about the effect of FGF10 on the recovery process after skin damage. In this study, we found that the expression of endogenous FGF10 was increased during wound healing. We prepared FGF10-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (FGF10-PLGA) microspheres, and it could sustain release of FGF10 both in vitro and in vivo, accelerating wound healing. Further analysis revealed that compared with FGF10 alone, FGF10-PLGA microspheres significantly improved granulation formation, collagen synthesis, cell proliferation, and blood vessel density. In the meantime, we found that FGF10-PLGA microspheres inhibited the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. Notably, activating ER stress with tunicamycin (TM) reduced therapeutic effects of FGF10-PLGA microspheres in wound healing, whereas inhibition of ER stress with 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) improved the function of FGF10-PLGA microspheres. Taken together, this study indicates that FGF10-PLGA microspheres accelerate wound healing presumably through modulating ER stress.
33354283/TBHQ-Overview of Multiple Mechanisms against Oxidative Stress for Attenuating Methamphetamine-Induced Neurotoxicity Methamphetamine is a derivative of amphetamines, a highly addictive central stimulant with multiple systemic toxicity including the brain, heart, liver, lung, and spleen. It has adverse effects such as apoptosis and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Methamphetamine is a fatal and toxic chemical substance, and its lethal mechanism has been widely studied in recent years. The possible mechanism is that methamphetamine can cause cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity mainly by inducing oxidative stress so as to generate heat, eliminate people's hunger and thirst, and maintain a state of excitement so that people can continue to exercise. According to many research, there is no doubt that methamphetamine triggers neurotoxicity by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and redox imbalance. This review summarized the mechanisms of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity including apoptosis and blood-brain barrier breakdown through oxidative stress and analyzed several possible antioxidative mechanisms of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) which is a kind of food additive with antioxidative effects. As a nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) agonist, TBHQ may inhibit neurotoxicity caused by oxidative stress through the following three mechanisms: the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system, the astrocytes activation, and the glutathione pathway. The mechanism about methamphetamine's toxic effects and its antioxidative therapeutic drugs would become a research hotspot in this field and has very important research significance.
33317552/Manipulating the position of DNA expression cassettes using location tags fused to dCas9 (Cas9-Lag) to improve metabolic pathway efficiency Background Deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) led to significant improvement of CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques because it can be fused with a variety of functional groups to form diverse molecular devices, which can manipulate or modify target DNA cassettes. One important metabolic engineering strategy is to localize the enzymes in proximity of their substrates for improved catalytic efficiency. In this work, we developed a novel molecular device to manipulate the cellular location of specific DNA cassettes either on plasmids or on the chromosome, by fusing location tags to dCas9 (Cas9-Lag), and applied the technique for synthetic biology applications. Carotenoids like beta-carotene serve as common intermediates for the synthesis of derivative compounds, which are hydrophobic and usually accumulate in the membrane compartment. Results Carotenoids like beta-carotene serve as common intermediates for the synthesis of derivative compounds, which are hydrophobic and usually accumulate in the membrane components. To improve the functional expression of membrane-bound enzymes and localize them in proximity to the substrates, Cas9-Lag was used to pull plasmids or chromosomal DNA expressing carotenoid enzymes onto the cell membrane. For this purpose, dCas9 was fused to the E. coli membrane docking tag GlpF, and gRNA was designed to direct this fusion protein to the DNA expression cassettes. With Cas9-Lag, the zeaxanthin and astaxanthin titer increased by 29.0% and 26.7% respectively. Due to experimental limitations, the electron microscopy images of cells expressing Cas9-Lag vaguely indicated that GlpF-Cas9 might have pulled the target DNA cassettes in close proximity to membrane. Similarly, protein mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins suggested an increased expression of carotenoid-converting enzymes in the membrane components. Conclusion This work therefore provides a novel molecular device, Cas9-Lag, which was proved to increase zeaxanthin and astaxanthin production and might be used to manipulate DNA cassette location.
33307846/Preparation, optimization, and in vivo evaluation of an inhaled solution of total saponins of Panax notoginseng and its protective effect against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Abstract Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive pulmonary disease that can cause fibrotic remodeling of the surrounding lung, thus leading to respiratory failure. Although IPF is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, the precise mechanisms underlying this condition remain unknown. In this study, we used total saponins of Panax notoginseng inhalation solution (TIS) to induce idiopathic bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The uniformity of delivery dose was investigated by analyzing the aerodynamic particle size distribution and drug stability. The potential of hydrogen potential of hydrogen (pH) of the inhalation solution was 7.0 and the solvent 0.9% NaCl solution, thus meeting physiological requirements for pulmonary drug administration. The delivery rate was 1.94 +- 0.16 mg min-1 and the total dose was 17.40 +- 0.04 mg. TIS was composed of five key components: notoginsenoside R1, ginsenosides Rg1, ginsenosides Re, ginsenosides Rb1, and ginsenosides Rd. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for these five components were 3.62 +- 0.05 microm, 3.62 +- 0.06 microm, 3.65 +- 0.10 microm, 3.62 +- 0.06 microm, and 3.61 +- 0.05 microm, respectively. Fine particle fraction (FPF) was 66.24 +- 0.73%, 66.20 +- 0.89%, 66.07 +- 1.42%, 66.18 +- 0.79%, and 66.29 +- 0.70%, respectively. The MMAD for inhalation solutions needs to be 1-5 microm, which indicates that the components of TIS are suitable for inhalation. It is important to control the particle size of targeted drugs to ensure that the drug is delivered to the appropriate target tissue. In vitro experiments indicated that TIS exhibited high rates of deposition in lung tissue, thus indicating that pulmonary delivery systems may represent a good therapeutic option for patients.
33307844/Cyclodextrin pendant polymer as an efficient drug carrier for scutellarin Abstract A novel beta-cyclodextrin pendant polymer (epsilon-PL-CD), composed of poly(epsilon-lysine) (epsilon-PL) main chain and glycine-beta-cyclodextrin (Gly-CD) side chains, was prepared by a simple two-step procedure. The epsilon-PL-CD was investigated as a drug carrier of hydrophobic drug scutellarin (SCU). The characterization and complexation mode of the SCU:epsilon-PL-CD were researched in both solution and solid state by means of photoluminescence spectroscopy, 1H and 2D NMR, X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermal gravimetric analysis, Particle size and Zeta potential. The solubility test indicated that the solubilizing ability of SCU:epsilon-PL-CD was significantly improved compared with SCU:beta-CD and free SCU. Besides, in vitro cell experiment, it was found that SCU:epsilon-PL-CD has a strong inhibitory effect on the growth and invasion of tumor cells. The present study provides useful information for epsilon-PL-CD as a drug carrier material.
33390788/Inhibition of human amylin aggregation by Flavonoid Chrysin: An in-silico and in-vitro approach Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin), consecrated by the pancreatic beta-cells with insulin, has a significant role to play in maintaining homeostasis of islet cell hormones. Alzheimer's disease is the predominant source of dementia. However, its etiology remains uncertain; it appears that type 2 diabetes mellitus and other prediabetic states of insulin resistance contribute to the intermittent Alzheimer's disease presence. Amylin is abnormally elevated in Type II diabetes patients, accumulated into amylin aggregates, and ultimately causes apoptosis of the beta-cells, and till date, its mechanism remains unclear. Several flavonoids have inhibitory effects on amylin amyloidosis, but its inhibition mechanisms are unknown. Screening a collection of traditional compounds revealed the flavone Chrysin, a potential lead compound. Chrysin inhibits amyloid aggregate formation according to Thioflavin T binding, turbidimetry assay. We report results of molecular interaction analysis of Chrysin with amylin which shows potent binding affinity against amylin. Pharmacokinetics and Drug likeness studies of Chrysin also suggest that it is a potential lead compound. Therefore, Chrysin prevented amylin aggregation.
33390776/Oridonin inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by negatively regulating AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway Oridonin, derived from Rabdosia rubescens, has exhibited anticancer activity in a variety of cancers. However, few studies have explored the effect of oridonin (ORI) on migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In our study, the results demonstrated that oridonin significantly inhibited migration and invasion of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z and HNE-1 cell lines, as depicted by wound healing and Transwell assays. In addition, oridonin increased the expression of E-Cadherin while decreased the expressions of vimentin and twist1 at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, oridonin also decreased cell mobility in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The subsequent results of western blotting uncovered that the phosphorylation levels of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were decreased upon oridonin treatment. Furthermore, co-treatment with the AKT activator SC-79 attenuated the anti-metastatic effect of oridonin on nasopharyngeal carcinoma and partially abolished the high expression of E-cadherin and the low expression of twist1 mediated by oridonin. In conclusion, the results revealed that oridonin could repress metastatic phenotype and reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by negatively regulating AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway, suggesting that AKT/STAT3 signaling may be the potential therapeutic target of oridonin against nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
33390794/Upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and the lipid metabolism pathway promotes carcinogenesis of ampullary cancer Ampullary cancer is a rare periampullary cancer currently with no targeted therapeutic agent. It is important to develop a deeper understanding of the carcinogenesis of ampullary cancer. We attempted to explore the characteristics of ampullary cancer in our dataset and a public database, followed by a search for potential drugs. We used a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze complementary (c)DNA microarray data of ampullary cancer and surrounding normal duodenal tissues from five patients. A public database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) was applied for external validation. Bioinformatics tools used included the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), MetaCore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Hallmark, BioCarta, Reactome, and Connectivity Map (CMap). In total, 9097 genes were upregulated in the five ampullary cancer samples compared to normal duodenal tissues. From the MetaCore analysis, genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-regulated lipid metabolism were overexpressed in ampullary cancer tissues. Further a GSEA of the KEGG, Hallmark, Reactome, and Gene Ontology databases revealed that PPARA and lipid metabolism-related genes were enriched in our specimens of ampullary cancer and in the NCBI GSE39409 database. Expressions of PPARA messenger (m)RNA and the PPAR-alpha protein were higher in clinical samples and cell lines of ampullary cancer. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, including alvespimycin, trichostatin A (a histone deacetylase inhibitor), and cytochalasin B, may have novel therapeutic effects in ampullary cancer patients as predicted by the CMap analysis. Trichostatin A was the most potent agent for ampullary cancer with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of < 0.3 muM. According to our results, upregulation of PPARA and lipid metabolism-related genes are potential pathways in the carcinogenesis and development of ampullary cancer. Results from the CMap analysis suggested potential drugs for patients with ampullary cancer.
33390782/Comparing mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin with Torin-2 within the RIST molecular-targeted regimen in neuroblastoma cells The prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma remains dismal and novel therapeutic options are urgently needed. The RIST treatment protocol has a multimodal metronomic therapy design combining molecular-targeted drugs (Rapamycin and Dasatinib) with chemotherapy backbone (Irinotecan and Temozolomide), which is currently verified in a phase II clinical trial (NCT01467986). With the availability of novel and more potent ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors, we expect to improve the RIST combination therapy. By comparing the IC50 values of Torin-1, Torin-2, AZD3147 and PP242 we established that only Torin-2 inhibited cell viability of all three MycN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines tested at nanomolar concentration. Single treatment of both mTOR inhibitors induced a significant G1 cell cycle arrest and combination treatment with Dasatinib reduced the expression of cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 or increased the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21. The combinatorial index depicted for both mTOR inhibitors a synergistic effect with Dasatinib. Interestingly, compared to Rapamycin, the combination treatment with Torin-2 resulted in a broader mTOR pathway inhibition as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of AKT (Thr308, Ser473), 4E-BP (Ser65), and S6K (Thr389). Furthermore, substituting Rapamycin in the modified multimodal RIST protocol with Torin-2 reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis despite a significant lower Torin-2 drug concentration applied. The efficacy of nanomolar concentrations may significantly reduce unwanted immunosuppression associated with Rapamycin. However, at this point we cannot rule out that Torin-2 has increased toxicity due to its potency in more complex systems. Nonetheless, our results suggest that including Torin-2 as a substitute for Rapamycin in the RIST protocol may represent a valid option to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for relapsed or treatment-refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.
33390789/Reduction of pl-CSA through ChSy-2 knockout inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis of choriocarcinoma in JEG3 cells Background: Placental-like chondroitin sulfate A (pl-CSA) is exclusively expressed in cancerous and placental tissues and is highly correlated with the degree of malignancy. However, the mechanism through which pl-CSA regulates tumorigenesis and metastasis in choriocarcinoma remains unclear. Methods: Stable transfectants of the JEG3 choriocarcinoma cell line, including a negative control (NC) line and a cell line with knockout of the biosynthetic enzyme CS synthase-2 (ChSy-2) (ChSy-2-/-), were obtained using CRISPR/Cas9 systems and identified by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation of the cells were determined by a cell counting kit, scratch-wound assays, transwell assays and soft agar colony formation assays in vitro, respectively. The tumorigenesis and metastasis of choriocarcinoma were also investigated through two xenograft models in vivo. Results: The ChSy-2 protein in the ChSy-2-/-group was below the detection threshold, which was accompanied a significant reduction in the pl-CSA level. Reducing pl-CSA through ChSy-2 knockout significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation in vitro and tumorigenesis and metastasis of choriocarcinoma, with deceases in tumor volume and metastatic foci and a high percent survival compared to the NC in vivo. Conclusion: pl-CSA, as a necessary component of JEG-3 cells, was efficiently reduced through ChSy-2 knockout, which significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis and metastasis of choriocarcinoma. ChSy-2/pl-CSA could be alternative targets for tumor therapy.
33390784/Juniperus indica Bertol. extract synergized with cisplatin against melanoma cells via the suppression of AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling and induction of cell apoptosis Juniperus indica Bertol. is an herbal plant that belongs to the genus Juniperus, which is commonly used in traditional medicine to refresh the mind and for diuretic use. However, few studies have reported the function of J. indica Bertol. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor and synergistic potential of J. indica Bertol. extract (JIB extract) for melanoma cells. Our results indicated the anti-melanoma activity of JIB extract. JIB extract induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and decreased cyclin and cdk protein expressions. In addition, AKT/mTOR signaling and MAPK signaling were inhibited by JIB extract to suppress melanoma cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, JIB extract induced B16/F10 cell apoptosis via the caspase cascade. According to the JIB extract's anti-melanoma capacity, to assess the synergistic effects of cisplatin and JIB extract. The results demonstrated that JIB extract combined with cisplatin enhanced the inhibition of cell growth, proliferation, and survival through the obstruction of cell cycle progression and AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling as well as the induction of cell apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicate that JIB extract showed anti-tumor effects and synergized with cisplatin against B16/F10 cells, indicating the possibility of JIB extract to be developed as adjuvant therapy for melanoma.
33390773/Mulberry leaves extract ameliorates alcohol-induced liver damages through reduction of acetaldehyde toxicity and inhibition of apoptosis caused by oxidative stress signals Mulberry leaves (Morus alba L.), which are traditional Chinese herbs, exert several biological functions, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammation, antidiabetic, and antitumor. Alcohol intake increases inflammation and oxidative stress, and this increase causes liver injury and leads to liver steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are major health problems worldwide. Previous report indicated that mulberry leaf extract (MLE) exited hepatoprotection effects against chronic alcohol-induced liver damages. In this present study, we investigated the effects of MLE on acute alcohol and liver injury induced by its metabolized compound called acetaldehyde (ACE) by using in vivo and in vitro models. Administration of MLE reversed acute alcohol-induced liver damages, increased acetaldehyde (ACE) level, and decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Acute alcohol exposure-induced leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammation factors, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were blocked by MLE in proportion to MLE concentration. MLE prevented alcohol-induced liver apoptosis via enhanced caveolin-1 expression and attenuated EGFR/STAT3/iNOS pathway using immunohistochemical analysis. ACE induced proteins, such as iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, and inhibited superoxide dismutase expression, whereas co-treated with MLE reversed these proteins expression. MLE also recovered alcohol-induced apoptosis in cultured Hep G2 cells. Overall, our findings indicated that MLE ameliorated acute alcohol-induced liver damages by reducing ACE toxicity and inhibiting apoptosis caused by oxidative stress signals. Our results implied that MLE might be a potential agent for treating alcohol liver disease.
33390783/MiR-125b promotes migration and invasion by targeting the vitamin D receptor in renal cell carcinoma Purpose: To investigate the expression of miR-125b and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and assess the biological function of miR-125b in RCC. Methods: We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the expression of nucleic acids and western blotting to analyze the protein abundance in RCC cell lines. MiR-125b mimic and inhibitor were employed to investigate the function and behavior of miR-125b in RCC cell lines. The relationship between miR-125 and VDR was verified using luciferase assays. Results: Overexpression of miR-125b promoted migration and invasion and prevent cell apoptosis in ACHN cells. In contrast, miR-125b deficiency suppressed migration and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in 786-O cells. Luciferase assays indicated the interaction between miR-125b and VDR. In collected samples, miR-125b was significantly higher in RCC tissues and negatively correlated to VDR (r=-0.444, p=0.04). Conclusion: MiR-125b displays an oncogene profile in RCC, patients with high expression of miR-125b should be a more frequent follow-up. MiR-125B may be a potential therapeutic target for RCC.
33376577/A Positive Feed Forward Loop between Wnt/beta-Catenin and NOX4 Promotes Silicon Dioxide-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Lung Epithelial Cells Silicosis is a chronic fibrotic lung disease caused by the accumulation of silica dust in the distal lung. Canonical Wnt signaling and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis including silicosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of crosstalk between these two signalings are not fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to explore the interaction of Wnt/beta-catenin and NOX4 of human epithelial cells in response to an exposure of silica dust. Results demonstrated an elevated expression of key components of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and NOX4 in the lungs of silicon dioxide- (SiO2-) induced silicosis mice. Furthermore, the activated Wnt/beta-catenin and NOX4 signaling are accompanied by an inhibition of cell proliferation, an increase of ROS production and cell apoptosis, and an upregulation of profibrogenic factors in BEAS-2B human lung epithelial cells exposed to SiO2. A mechanistic study further demonstrated that the Wnt3a-mediated activation of canonical Wnt signaling could augment the SiO2-induced NOX4 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production but reduced glutathione (GSH), while Wnt inhibitor DKK1 exhibited an opposite effect to Wnt3a. Vice versa, an overexpression of NOX4 further activated SiO2-induced Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response along with a reduction of GSH, whereas the shRNA-mediated knockdown of NOX4 showed an opposite effect to NOX4 overexpression. These results imply a positive feed forward loop between Wnt/beta-catenin and NOX4 signaling that may promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung epithelial cells in response to an exposure of silica dust, which may thus provide an insight into the profibrogenic role of Wnt/beta-catenin and NOX4 crosstalk in lung epithelial cell injury and pathogenesis of silicosis.
33328496/The value of three narrow-band imaging model in the diagnosis of small colorectal polyps This prospective study was aimed to evaluate the clinical value of narrow-band imaging (NBI), magnification endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (NBIME) and magnification endoscopy with acetic acid enhancement and narrow-band imaging (AA-NBIME) in the diagnosis of small colorectal polyps. We studied 261 small colorectal polyps from 122 patients with the use of above three techniques. Lesions were resected for histopathological analysis. The endoscopic images were independently reviewed by three experts and three non-experts and the diagnostic accuracy and image definition were compared among the modalities. The "experts-agreed" diagnostic accuracy was 87.7% for NBI versus 91.6% for NBIME versus 94.6% for AA-NBIME. The "non-experts-agreed" diagnostic accuracy was 80.1% for NBI versus 84.3% for NBIME versus 89.3% for AA-NBIME. All experts and non-experts diagnosed the small colorectal polyps statistically more accurately with AA-NBIME than NBI (P < 0.05). In all three modalities, the expert group's diagnostic accuracies were statistically significantly higher compared with the non-expert group. For experts, the Kappa values for AA-NBIME, NBIME and NBI diagnosis were 0.962 (0.892-1.032), 0.577 (0.507-0.647) and 0.567 (0.497-0.637), respectively; while for nonexperts, 0.818 (0.748-0.888), 0.532 (0.462-0.602) and 0.530 (0.460-0.600). This demonstrated a good reproducibility of AA-NBIME diagnosis. The average scores (experts and non-experts) of images acquired using AA-NBIME were significantly higher than those acquired using NBIME and ME (P < 0.05). AA-NBIME is a promising tool to clearly visualize the mucosal pit pattern (PP) of colorectal polyps for better differentiating neoplastic polyps from non-neoplastic ones.
33328544/Metronomic photodynamic therapy using an implantable LED device and orally administered 5-aminolevulinic acid Metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT) is a form of PDT that induces cancer cell death by intermittent continuous irradiation with a relatively weak power of light for a long duration (several days). We previously developed a wirelessly powered, fully implantable LED device and reported a significant anti-tumor effect of mPDT. Considering application in clinical practice, the method used for repeated administrations of photosensitizers required for mPDT should not have a high patient burden such as the burden of transvenous administration. Therefore, in this study, we selected 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which can be administered orally, as a photosensitizer, and we studied the antitumor effects of mPDT. In mice with intradermal tumors that were orally administered ALA (200 mg/kg daily for 5 days), the tumor in each mouse was simultaneously irradiated (8 h/day for 5 days) using a wirelessly powered implantable green LED device (532 nm, 0.05 mW). Tumor growth in the mPDT-treated mice was suppressed by about half compared to that in untreated mice. The results showed that mPDT using the wirelessly powered implantable LED device exerted an antitumor effect even with the use of orally administered ALA, and this treatment scheme can reduce the burden of photosensitizer administration for a patient.
33328579/Fabrication of nanochitosan incorporated polypyrrole/alginate conducting scaffold for neural tissue engineering The utilization of conductive polymers for fabrication of neural scaffolds have attracted much interest because of providing a microenvironment which can imitate nerve tissues. In this study, polypyrrole (PPy)-alginate (Alg) composites were prepared using different percentages of alginate and pyrrole by oxidative polymerization method using FeCl3 as an oxidant and electrical conductivity of composites were measured by four probe method. In addition, chitosan-based nanoparticles were synthesized by ionic gelation method and after characterization merged into PPy-Alg composite in order to fabricate a conductive, hydrophilic, processable and stable scaffold. Physiochemical characterization of nanochitosan/PPy-Alg scaffold such as electrical conductivity, porosity, swelling and degradation was investigated. Moreover, cytotoxicity and proliferation were examined by culturing OLN-93 neural and human dermal fibroblasts cells on the Nanochitosan/PPy-Alg scaffold. Due to the high conductivity, the film with ratio 2:10 (PPy-Alg) was recognized more suitable for fabrication of the final scaffold. Results from FT-IR and SEM, evaluation of porosity, swelling and degradation, as well as viability and proliferation of OLN-93 neural and fibroblast cells confirmed cytocompatiblity of the Nanochitosan/PPy-Alg scaffold. Based on the features of the constructed scaffold, Nanochitosan/PPy-Alg scaffold can be a proper candidate for neural tissue engineering.
33328530/Identification of a new cannabidiol n-hexyl homolog in a medicinal cannabis variety with an antinociceptive activity in mice: cannabidihexol The two most important and studied phytocannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa L. are undoubtedly cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic compound, but with other pharmacological properties, and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), which instead possesses psychotropic activity and is responsible for the recreative use of hemp. Recently, the homolog series of both CBDs and THCs has been expanded by the isolation in a medicinal cannabis variety of four new phytocannabinoids possessing on the resorcinyl moiety a butyl-(in CBDB and Delta9-THCB) and a heptyl-(in CBDP and Delta9-THCP) aliphatic chain. In this work we report a new series of phytocannabinoids that fills the gap between the pentyl and heptyl homologs of CBD and Delta9-THC, bearing a n-hexyl side chain on the resorcinyl moiety that we named cannabidihexol (CBDH) and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabihexol (Delta9-THCH), respectively. However, some cannabinoids with the same molecular formula and molecular weight of CBDH and Delta9-THCH have been already identified and reported as monomethyl ether derivatives of the canonical phytocannabinoids, namely cannabigerol monomethyl ether (CBGM), cannabidiol monomethyl ether (CBDM) and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol monomethyl ether (Delta9-THCM). The unambiguously identification in cannabis extract of the n-hexyl homologues of CBD and Delta9-THC different from the corresponding methylated isomers (CBDM, CBGM and Delta9-THCM) was achieved by comparison of the retention time, molecular ion, and fragmentation spectra with those of the authentic standards obtained via stereoselective synthesis, and a semi-quantification of these cannabinoids in the FM2 medical cannabis variety was provided. Conversely, no trace of Delta9-THCM was detected. Moreover, CBDH was isolated by semipreparative HPLC and its identity was confirmed by comparison with the spectroscopic data of the corresponding synthetic standard. Thus, the proper recognition of CBDH, CBDM and Delta9-THCH closes the loop and might serve in the future for researchers to distinguish between these phytocannabinoids isomers that show a very similar analytical behaviour. Lastly, CBDH was assessed for biological tests in vivo showing interesting analgesic activity at low doses in mice.
33328561/Reduced lifespan of erythrocytes in Dahl/Salt sensitive rats is the cause of the renal proximal tubule damage We studied the mechanisms of anemia and the influence of anemia on renal pathology in Dahl/Salt Sensitive (Dahl/SS) rat, a model of cardio-renal-anemia syndrome. Erythrocyte lifespan was shortened and associated with decreased hemoglobin level in the Dahl/SS rats given high-salt diet. Serum haptoglobin decreased, reticulocytes increased, and erythropoiesis in the bone marrow and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen was markedly stimulated by increased serum erythropoietin in them. As a mechanism of hemolysis, we investigated the incidence of eryptosis, suicidal death of erythrocytes. Eryptosis was increased, and red blood cell-derived microparticles, small particle which are generated in hemolytic disease, were also increased in Dahl/SS rats fed with high-salt diet. Deposition of hemosiderin and mitochondrial morphologic abnormality, a sign of ferroptosis, in proximal renal tubules was associated with intravascular hemolysis. Treatment with deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, reduced the renal proximal tubular injury and the glomerular sclerosis in Dahl/SS rats fed with high-salt diet. In conclusion, reduced half-life of erythrocytes induced by hemolysis is the major cause of anemia in Dahl/SS rat. Iron accumulation induced by hemolysis causes renal proximal tubule injury and accelerates renal damage in this model.
33166073/Cockayne syndrome proteins CSA and CSB maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through NAD+ signaling Abstract Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare premature aging disease, most commonly caused by mutations of the genes encoding the CSA or CSB proteins. CS patients display cachectic dwarfism and severe neurological manifestations and have an average life expectancy of 12 years. The CS proteins are involved in transcription and DNA repair, with the latter including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). However, there is also evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in CS, which likely contributes to the severe premature aging phenotype of this disease. While damaged mitochondria and impaired mitophagy were characterized in mice with CSB deficiency, such changes in the CS nematode model and CS patients are not fully known. Our cross-species transcriptomic analysis in CS postmortem brain tissue, CS mouse, and nematode models shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is indeed a common feature in CS. Restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction through NAD+ supplementation significantly improved lifespan and healthspan in the CS nematodes, highlighting mitochondrial dysfunction as a major driver of the aging features of CS. In cerebellar samples from CS patients, we found molecular signatures of dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics and impaired mitophagy/autophagy. In primary cells depleted for CSA or CSB, this dysfunction can be corrected with supplementation of NAD+ precursors. Our study provides support for the interconnection between major causative aging theories, DNA damage accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and compromised mitophagy/autophagy. Together, these three agents contribute to an accelerated aging program that can be averted by cellular NAD+ restoration. Cross-species analysis in CS postmortem brain tissue, CS cell, mouse, and nematode models indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature in CS. Augmenting NAD+ levels by supplementing NAD+ precursors such as NR (nicotinamide riboside) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) in CS can ameliorate age-associated defects and mitochondrial abnormalities.  
33274583/Anthocyanins attenuate endothelial dysfunction through regulation of uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase in aged rats Abstract Endothelial dysfunction is one of the main age-related arterial phenotypes responsible for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults. This endothelial dysfunction results from decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) arising downstream of endothelial oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of anthocyanins and the underlying mechanism in rat thoracic aorta and human vascular endothelial cells in aging models. In vitro, cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C-3-R) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C-3-G) inhibited the d-galactose (d-gal)-induced senescence in human endothelial cells, as indicated by reduced senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity, p21, and p16INK4a. Anthocyanins blocked d-gal-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and NADPH oxidase activity. Anthocyanins reversed d-gal-mediated inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) serine phosphorylation and SIRT1 expression, recovering NO level in endothelial cells. Also, SIRT1-mediated eNOS deacetylation was shown to be involved in anthocyanin-enhanced eNOS activity. In vivo, anthocyanin-rich mulberry extract was administered to aging rats for 8 weeks. In vivo, mulberry extract alleviated endothelial senescence and oxidative stress in the aorta of aging rats. Consistently, mulberry extract also raised serum NO levels, increased phosphorylation of eNOS, increased SIRT1 expression, and reduced nitrotyrosine in aortas. The eNOS acetylation was higher in the aging group and was restored by mulberry extract treatment. Similarly, SIRT1 level associated with eNOS decreased in the aging group and was restored in aging plus mulberry group. These findings indicate that anthocyanins protect against endothelial senescence through enhanced NO bioavailability by regulating ROS formation and reducing eNOS uncoupling. Aging is known for its correlation with increased protein acetylation rates and the decline of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) deacetylation activity. This study demonstrated that anthocyanin-rich mulberry extract reduces oxidative stress in aging vasculature and attenuates endothelial dysfunction through reversed inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), serine phosphorylation, and SIRT1 expression, recovering NO level in senescence.  
33328545/Co-delivery of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and doxorubicin via gold nanoparticle equipped with affibody-DNA hybrid strands for targeted synergistic chemotherapy of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer Combination chemotherapy is still of great importance as part of the standard clinical care for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer. As an attractive component, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively studied as biosafety nanomaterials, but they are rarely explored as drug nanocarriers for targeted co-delivery of multiple chemotherapeutics. Herein, a novel affibody-DNA hybrid strands modified AuNPs were fabricated for co-loading nucleoside analogue (5-fluorodeoxyuridine, FUdR) and anthracycline (doxorubicin, Dox). FUdRs were integrated into DNA hybrid strands decorated on AuNPs by DNA solid phase synthesis, and Dox molecules were intercalated into their duplex regions. Affibody molecules coupled to the DNA hybrid strands were distributed the surface of AuNPs, giving them targeting for HER2. The new dual-drug-containing affibody-DNA-AuNPs (Dox@affi-F/AuNPs) owned compact and stable spherical nanostructures, and precise drug loading. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that these nanoparticles caused a higher inhibition in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells, and showed better synergistic antitumor activity than simple mixture of the two drugs. The related mechanistic studies proved that Dox@affi-F/AuNPs achieved a remarkable combined antitumor activity of Dox and FUdR by promoting more cells to enter apoptosis pathway. Our work provided a nanomedicine platform for targeted co-delivery of nucleoside analog therapeutics and anthracycline anticancer drugs to achieve synergistic treatment of HER2+ cancer.
33263456/The effect of radiolabeled nanostructured lipid carrier systems containing imatinib mesylate on NIH-3T3 and CRL-1739 cells Abstract The aim of current study is to develop new nanostructured lipid carrier systems (NLCSs) containing imatinib mesylate (IMT) and evaluate their targeting efficiency on NIH-3T3 as fibroblast cells and CRL-1739 as gastric adenocarcinoma cells with radiolabeled formulations. Three formulations (F1-IMT, F2-IMT and F3-IMT) were prepared and radiolabeled with 1 mCi/0.1 mL of [99mTc]Tc. The effect of reducing and antioxidant agents on radiolabeling process was evaluated and radiochemical purity of formulations was performed by radio thin-layer radiochromatography (RTLC). The results demonstrated that the radiochemical purity was found to be above 90% for [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc-F2-IMT, while radiochemical purity of [99mTc]Tc-F3-IMT was found to be 85.61 +- 2.24%. Also, [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc-F2-IMT have better stability in cell medium and saline than [99mTc]Tc-F3-IMT. Targeting efficiency of [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc-F2-IMT comparatively evaluated by cell binding studies with [99mTc]NaTcO4 on NIH-3T3 and CRL-1739 cells. The cell binding capacity and targeting/non-targeting cell uptake ratio of these two formulations was found to be higher than [99mTc]NaTcO4 in CRL-1739. It is thought that the knowledge achieved in this study would contribute to using [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc F2-IMT as an diagnosis and treatment agents.
33376582/Dual and Opposite Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in Chagas Disease: Beneficial on the Pathogen and Harmful on the Host Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease, which affects an estimate of 6-7 million people worldwide. Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is a eukaryotic flagellate unicellular organism. At the primary infection sites, these parasites are phagocytized by macrophages, which produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to the infection with T. cruzi. The ROS produce damage to the host tissues; however, macrophage-produced ROS is also used as a signal for T. cruzi proliferation. At the later stages of infection, mitochondrial ROS is produced by the infected cardiomyocytes that contribute to the oxidative damage, which persists at the chronic stage of the disease. The oxidative damage leads to a functional impairment of the heart. In this review article, we will discuss the mechanisms by which T. cruzi is able to deal with the oxidative stress and how this helps the parasite growth at the acute phase of infection and how the oxidative stress affects the cardiomyopathy at the chronic stage of the Chagas disease. We will describe the mechanisms used by the parasite to deal with ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) through the trypanothione and the mechanisms used to repair the damaged DNA. Also, a description of the events produced by ROS at the acute and chronic stages of the disease is presented. Lastly, we discuss the benefits of ROS for T. cruzi growth and proliferation and the possible mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Hypothesis is put forward to explain the molecular mechanisms by which ROS triggers parasite growth and proliferation and how ROS is able to produce a long persisting damage on cardiomyocytes even in the absence of the parasite.
33332210/Comprehensive study of dexamethasone on albumin biogenesis during normal and pathological renal conditions Abstract Context  Dexamethasone (DXM) has an anti-immunoinflammatory effect, and is often used in acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the effects of DXM on albumin (ALB) have not been fully studied. Objective  To investigate the effects of DXM on ALB production and renal function. Materials and methods  Male Wistar rats were divided into normal and DXM groups (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg for 5 days) (n = 15) for a dose-dependent study. Rats were divided into normal group and DXM groups (0.5 mg/kg for 3, 5, 7 days) (n = 9) for a time-dependent study. In AKI experiment, rats were divided into normal (saline), cisplatin (CP, 5 mg/kg, i.v.), CP + DXM groups (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.m.) (n = 16). The blood and the organs were isolated for analysis. Results  In normal, serum ALB (sALB) and serum total protein (sTP) increased in DXM group with sALB increased 19.8-32.2% (from small to large dosages); and 30.2-32.5.6% (from 3 to 7 days of DXM); sTP 15.7-22.6% and 14.2-24.3%; urine ALB (uALB) 31.5-392.3%, and 1047.2-1390.8%; urine TP (uTP) 0.68-173.1% and 98.0-504.9%, compared with normal groups. DXM increased the mRNA expression of Cebp and Hnf, suppressing podocin. In AKI, DXM decreased serum BUN (53.7%), serum Cre (73.4%), sALB (30.0%), sTP (18.7%), uALB (74.5%), uTP (449.3%), rescuing the suppressed podocin in kidney. Conclusions  DXM acts on Cebp and Hnf and promotes ALB production. This finding helps to evaluate the rationale of DXM for kidney injury.
33332205/Arecoline suppresses epithelial cell viability by upregulating tropomyosin-1 through the transforming growth factor-beta/Smad pathway Abstract Context  Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic and progressive disease. Arecoline, present in betel nuts, has been proposed as a vital aetiological factor. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Objectives  This research elucidates the expression of tropomyosin-1 (TPM1) and its regulation mechanism in HaCaT cells treated with arecoline. Materials and methods  HaCaT cells were assigned into three groups: (1) Control; (2) Treated with arecoline (0.16 mM) for 48 h (3) Treated with arecoline (0.16 mM) and transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for TPM1 (50 nM) for 48 h. CCK8, cell cycle, and apoptosis phenotypic analyses were performed. PCR and western blot analyses were performed to detect the expression level of TPM1 and examine the related signalling pathway. Results  The IC50 of arecoline was approximately 50 mug/mL (0.21 mM). The arecoline dose (0.16 mM) and time (48 h) markedly increased TPM1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in HaCaT cells. Arecoline suppressed the cell growth, caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and induced cell apoptosis in HaCaT cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TPM1 attenuated the effect of arecoline on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Furthermore, blocking of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor using SB431542 significantly suppressed TPM1 expression in the cells treated with arecoline. Discussion and conclusions  Arecoline suppresses HaCaT cell viability by upregulating TPM1 through the TGF-beta/Smad signalling pathway. This research provides a scientific basis for further study of arecoline and TPM1 in OSF and can be generalised to broader pharmacological studies. TPM1 may be a promising molecular target for treating OSF.
33415139/Screening of Concentration and Antimicrobial Effectiveness of Antimicrobial Preservative in Betastatin Besylate Nasal Spray Objective  To explore the optimal concentration and antimicrobial effectiveness of antimicrobial preservative in betastatin besylate nasal spray.  Methods  By using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger as test strains, the antimicrobial effectiveness of betastatin besylate nasal spray containing different concentrations of antimicrobial preservative (0.02%, 0.0125%, and 0.005% benzalkonium chloride, respectively) was determined by using bacteriostatic effect test (Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2015 edition).  Results  The antimicrobial effectiveness of betastatin besylate nasal spray containing 0.02% and 0.0125% benzalkonium chloride, respectively, complied with the regulations of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 Edition) against five test strains. However, the antimicrobial effectiveness of betastatin besylate nasal spray containing 0.005% benzalkonium chloride against P. aeruginosa did not meet the requirements of Chinese Pharmacopoeia.  Conclusion  Benzalkonium chloride at a concentration of 0.125% can be used as an added antimicrobial preservative in betastatin besylate nasal spray.
33414685/Nicotine Synergizes with High-Fat Diet to Induce an Anti-Inflammatory Microenvironment to Promote Breast Tumor Growth Breast cancer results from a complex interplay of genetics and environment that alters immune and inflammatory systems to promote tumorigenesis. Obesity and cigarette smoking are well-known risk factors associated breast cancer development. Nicotine known to decrease inflammatory signals also modulates immune responses that favor breast cancer development. However, the mechanisms by which nicotine and obesity contribute to breast cancer remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms by which nicotine (NIC) and high-fat diet (HFD) promote growth of HCC70 and HCC1806 xenografts from African American (AA) triple negative (TN) breast cancer cells. Immunodeficient mice fed on HFD and treated with NIC generated larger HCC70 and HCC1806 tumors when compared to NIC or HFD alone. Increased xenograft growth in the presence of NIC and HFD was accompanied by higher levels of tissue-resident macrophage markers and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL4, IL13, and IL10. We further validated the involvement of these players by in vitro and ex vivo experiments. We found a proinflammatory milieu with increased expression of IL6 and IL12 in xenografts with HFD. In addition, nicotine or nicotine plus HFD increased a subset of mammary cancer stem cells (MCSCs) and key adipose browning markers CD137 and TMEM26. Interestingly, there was upregulation of stress-induced pp38 MAPK and pERK1/2 in xenografts exposed to HFD alone or nicotine plus HFD. Scratch-wound assay showed marked reduction in proliferation/migration of nicotine and palmitate-treated breast cancer cells with mecamylamine (MEC), a nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) antagonist. Furthermore, xenograft development in immune-deficient mice, fed HFD plus nicotine, was reduced upon cotreatment with MEC and SB 203580, a pp38MAPK inhibitor. Our study demonstrates the presence of nicotine and HFD in facilitating an anti-inflammatory tumor microenvironment that influences breast tumor growth. This study also shows potential efficacy of combination therapy in obese breast cancer patients who smoke.
33415164/The Value of Contrast-Enhanced Transesophageal Echocardiography in the Detection of Cardiac Right-to-Left Shunt Related with Cryptogenic Stroke and Migraine Purpose  To analyze the characteristics of right-to-left shunt (RLS) in patients with cryptogenic stroke and migraine by contrast-enhanced transesophageal echocardiography (c-TEE).  Methods  The study population consisted of 330 patients with cryptogenic stroke and 330 patients with migraine who suspected PFO. All of them received c-TEE examination successfully. In terms of c-TEE analyses, RLS could be diagnosed when microbubbles were visualized in the transition from the right atrium to the left atrium. For semiquantitative analysis, a small amount of RLS was grade 1, indicating 1-10 microvesicles per frame could be seen in the left atrium, a moderate amount of RLS was grade 2, indicating 11-30 microvesicles per frame could be seen in the left atrium, and a large amount of RLS was grade 3, indicating more than 30 microvesicles per frame, or the left atrium is filled with microvesicles.  Results  A total of 660 patients were analyzed in the study. PFO-RLS was detected in 348 (348/660, 52.7%) cases by TEE, while in 392 (392/660, 59.3%) cases by c-TEE. Simultaneously, P-RLS was detected in 239 (239/660, 36.2%) cases by c-TEE. Among 330 patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO-RLS was detected in 198 cases; according to the c-TTE method (198/330, 60.0%), concurrently, 83 participants suffered from PFO-RLS and P-RSL (83/330, 25.1%), including 1 case with PFO and pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. Among 330 patients with migraine, PFO-RLS was detected in 194 cases; according to the c-TTE method (194/330, 58.7%), specifically, 90 participants suffered from PFO-RLS and P-RSL (90/330, 27.2%). There was no statistical significance between the two groups. P-RLS singly was detected in 28 cases with cryptogenic stroke, while in 38 cases with migraine, excluding from pulmonary arteriovenous fistula by CTA examination. In addition, semiquantitative results on c-TTE grading of RLS were compared between the two groups: grade 1 RLS in the migraine group (144/322) was significantly higher than that in the cryptogenic stroke group (71/309) (P < 0.05). Grade 3 RLS in the cryptogenic stroke group (113/309) was significantly higher than that in the migraine group (67/322) (P < 0.05). For grade 2 RLS, there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.12).  Conclusions  c-TEE can increase the positive rate of PFO diagnosis compared with TEE color Doppler. There is no significant difference in the incidence of PFO-PLS and P-RLS between the cryptogenic stroke group and the migraine group. The grades 2-3 RLS are mainly detected in the cryptogenic stroke group, while grades 1-2 RLS are mostly detected in the migraine group.
33415156/Time to Start Delivering Iron Chelation Therapy in Newly Diagnosed Severe beta-Thalassemia Background  Iron overload is still a major complication of severe beta-thalassemia. Indication to start iron chelation therapy is based on serum ferritin (SF) or transferrin saturation (TS) level or the amount of transfusion. The goal of this study is to analyse the pattern of iron status, the amount of transfusion regarding the time to start iron chelator, and serum hepcidin levels in newly diagnosed severe beta-thalassemia.  Methods  A prospective cohort study was performed at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital on newly diagnosed severe beta-thalassemia patients. Subjects had not received any blood transfusion with normal liver function test, CRP, and IL-6 levels who consumed normal diet according to age. The SF and TS levels indicate iron status, while hepcidin level indicates iron regulator status. Main indicator to start iron chelation therapy when SF level >=1.000 ng/mL, TS level >=70%, or after receiving transfusion at least 10 times. Statistical analysis used Mann-Whitney and Spearman.  Results  Forty-two newly severe beta-thalassemia, 30 (71.4%), were diagnosed before 1 year old, mean 9.9 +- 6.4 months, range 2-24 months. Range amount of transfusion until SF level reached >=1,000 ng/mL were 4-12 times, mean 7 +- 2 times. Mean SF and TS level at diagnosis were 365.6 +- 194.9 ng/mL and 67.3 +- 22.5%, while hepcidin level was normal, mean 242.6 +- 58 ng/mL. 36/42 patients have reached SF >1000 ng/mL with amount of transfusion less than 10 times. There was no significant difference of SF, TS, and hepcidin levels when SF >1000 ng/mL in the group with amount of transfusion 7-12 and less than 7 (p = 0.454, p = 0.084, p = 0.765), respectively. A significant positive correlation between SF and amount of transfusion was observed (p < 0.001; r = 0.781).  Conclusion  Iron overload in severe beta-thalassemia patients might occur earlier even before they received 10 times transfusion. Hepcidin serum level tends to increase when iron overload just started.
33415147/Berberine for Appetite Suppressant and Prevention of Obesity Berberine (BBR), a natural plant product, has been shown to have antidiabetic, cholesterol-reducing effects. To investigate the action of BBR as appetite suppressants, two experimental protocols were performed. In the first experiment, the mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet (HF). The mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of BBR (10 mg/kg or saline at 1 ml/kg) for 3 weeks. To determine the antiobesity effects of BBR, the food consumption, body weight, fat contents, serum leptin, and glucose level were investigated. In the second experiment, we set out to validate the effect of BBR on central neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulated rats. Experiments were carried out in 24-hour fasted rats, and then food intake and glucose level were subsequently recorded for 1 hour. The experimental groups were subdivided into the intra-3rd ventricular microinjections of ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid), neuropeptide Y (NPY; 100 nM), NPY+BBR (10 nM), and NPY+BBR (100 nM) group. And then the blood glucose level was examined. In the first experiment, treatment with BBR in the HF diet mice reduced food intake, body weight, fat contents, serum leptin, and glucose level. In the second experiment, the NPY-injected group increased food intake by 39.3%, and food intake was reduced in the BBR group by 47.5%, compared with the ACSF-injected group. Also, the serum glucose level in the NPY+BBR (100 nM) group was significantly lower than that in the NPY (100 nM) group. The results suggest that BBR improved lipid dysregulation in obesity by controlling the central obesity related pathway.
33357221/Comparative in vitro analysis of inhibition of rhinovirus and influenza virus replication by mucoactive secretolytic agents and plant extracts Background Rhinoviruses and influenza viruses cause millions of acute respiratory infections annually. Symptoms of mild acute respiratory infections are commonly treated with over-the-counter products like ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine, as well as of thyme and pelargonium extracts today. Because the direct antiviral activity of these over-the-counter products has not been studied in a systematic way, the current study aimed to compare their inhibitory effect against rhinovirus and influenza virus replication in an in vitro setting. Methods The cytotoxicity of ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine, as well as of thyme and pelargonium extracts was analyzed in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and HeLa Ohio cells. The antiviral effect of these over-the-counter products was compared by analyzing the dose-dependent inhibition (i) of rhinovirus A2- and B14-induced cytopathic effect in HeLa Ohio cells and (ii) of influenza virus A/Hong Kong/68 (subtype H3N2)- and A/Jena/8178/09 (subtype H1N1, pandemic)-induced cytopathic effect in MDCK cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. To get insights into the mechanism of action of pelargonium extract against influenza virus, we performed time-of-addition assays as well as hemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition assays. Results N-acetyl cysteine, thyme and pelargonium extract showed no or only marginal cytotoxicity in MDCK and HeLa Ohio cells in the tested concentration range. The 50% cytotoxic concentration of ambroxol and bromhexine was 51.85 and 61.24 muM, respectively. No anti-rhinoviral activity was detected at non-cytotoxic concentrations in this in vitro study setting. Ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine inhibited the influenza virus-induced cytopathic effect in MDCK cells no or less than 50%. In contrast, a dose-dependent anti-influenza virus activity of thyme and pelargonium extracts was demonstrated. The time-of addition assays revealed an inhibition of early and late steps of influenza virus replication by pelargonium extract whereas zanamivir acted on late steps only. The proven block of viral neuraminidase activity might explain the inhibition of influenza virus replication when added after viral adsorption. Conclusion The study results indicate a distinct inhibition of influenza A virus replication by thyme and pelargonium extract which might contribute to the beneficial effects of these plant extracts on acute respiratory infections symptoms.
33349069/Novel piperazine-chalcone hybrids and related pyrazoline analogues targeting VEGFR-2 kinase; design, synthesis, molecular docking studies, and anticancer evaluation Abstract New piperazine-chalcone hybrids and related pyrazoline derivatives have been designed and synthesised as potential vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) inhibitors. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has selected six compounds to evaluate their antiproliferative activity in vitro against 60 human cancer cells lines. Preliminary screening of the examined compounds indicated promising anticancer activity against number of cell lines. The enzyme inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2 was evaluated and IC50 of the tested compounds ranged from 0.57 microM to 1.48 microM. The most potent derivatives Vd and Ve were subjected to further investigations. A cell cycle analysis showed that both compounds mainly arrest HCT-116 cell cycle in the G2/M phase. Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay showed that Vd and Ve induced an approximately 18.7-fold and 21.2-fold total increase in apoptosis compared to the control. Additionally, molecular docking study was performed against VEGFR (PDB ID: 4ASD) using MOE 2015.10 software and Sorafenib as a reference ligand. Graphical Abstract
33381267/Allicin Attenuated Advanced Oxidation Protein Product-Induced Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Apoptosis in Human Nucleus Pulposus Cells Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is one of the most common chronic degenerative musculoskeletal disorders. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of the nucleus pulposus (NP) cells plays a key role during IDD progression. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), novel biomarkers of oxidative stress, have been reported to function in various diseases due to their potential for disrupting the redox balance. The current study is aimed at investigating the function of AOPP in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of human NP cells and the alleviative effects of allicin during this process which was known for its antioxidant properties. AOPP were demonstrated to hamper the viability and proliferation of NP cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and cause cell apoptosis markedly. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected in NP cells after AOPP stimulation, which resulted in depolarized mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP). Correspondingly, higher levels of AOPP were discovered in the human degenerative intervertebral discs (IVD). It was also found that allicin could protect NP cells against AOPP-mediated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction via suppressing the p38-MAPK pathway. These results disclosed a significant role of AOPP in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of NP cells, which could be involved in the primary pathogenesis of IDD. It was also revealed that allicin could be a promising therapeutic approach against AOPP-mediated oxidative stress during IDD progression.
33381275/Blue Light Irradiation Induces Human Keratinocyte Cell Damage via Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) Regulation Although blue light has been reported to affect skin cells negatively, little is known about its action mechanisms in skin cells. Therefore, we investigated the role of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in blue light-induced effects on human keratinocytes and its underlying mechanisms. Blue light decreased cell proliferation and upregulated TRPV1 expression. Blue light also suppressed the epidermal growth factor receptor- (EGFR-) mediated signaling pathway by reducing the protein levels of EGFR and suppressing the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta/FoxO3a pathway. The blue light-induced effect in cell proliferation was reversed by TRPV1 siRNA, but not capsazepine, a TRPV1-specific antagonist. In addition, blue light irradiation increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Blue light irradiation also increased both phosphorylation levels of TRPV1 and calcium influx. The blue light-induced increase in production of ROS and TNF-alpha was reversed by capsazepine. Furthermore, the blue light-induced increase in production of TNF-alpha was attenuated by SP600125 or PDTC. These findings show that blue light regulates cell survival and production of ROS and TNF-alpha; its effects are mediated via TRPV1. Specifically, the effects of blue light on cell proliferation are mediated by upregulating TRPV1, a negative regulator of EGFR-FoxO3a signaling. Blue light-induced production of ROS and TNF-alpha is also mediated through increased calcium influx via TRPV1 activation.
33357230/Indirect cholinergic activation slows down pancreatic cancer growth and tumor-associated inflammation Background Nerve-cancer interactions are increasingly recognized to be of paramount importance for the emergence and progression of pancreatic cancer (PCa). Here, we investigated the role of indirect cholinergic activation on PCa progression through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via clinically available AChE-inhibitors, i.e. physostigmine and pyridostigmine. Methods We applied immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, MTT-viability, invasion, flow-cytometric-cell-cycle-assays, phospho-kinase arrays, multiplex ELISA and xenografted mice to assess the impact of AChE inhibition on PCa cell growth and invasiveness, and tumor-associated inflammation. Survival analyses were performed in a novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable mouse model of PCa under adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine+/-physostigmine/pyridostigmine (n = 30 mice). Human PCa specimens (n = 39) were analyzed for the impact of cancer AChE expression on tumor stage and survival. Results We discovered a strong expression of AChE in cancer cells of human PCa specimens. Inhibition of this cancer-cell-intrinsic AChE via pyridostigmine and physostigmine, or administration of acetylcholine (ACh), diminished PCa cell viability and invasion in vitro and in vivo via suppression of pERK signaling, and reduced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable PCa mouse model, adjuvant co-therapy with AChE blockers had no impact on survival. Accordingly, survival of resected PCa patients did not differ based on tumor AChE expression levels. Patients with higher-stage PCa also exhibited loss of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme, choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), in their nerves. Conclusion For future clinical trials of PCa, direct cholinergic stimulation of the muscarinic signaling, rather than indirect activation via AChE blockade, may be a more effective strategy.
33355495/Pharmacokinetic interaction study between ligustrazine and valsartan in rats and its potential mechanism Abstract Context Ligustrazine and valsartan are commonly used drugs in the treatment of cardiac and cardiovascular disease. Objective The interaction between ligustrazine and valsartan was studied to investigate the effect of ligustrazine on the pharmacokinetics of valsartan. Materials and methods The pharmacokinetics of valsartan (10 mg/kg) was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats divided into three groups (with the pretreatment of 4 or 10 mg/kg/day ligustrazine for 10 days and without the pretreatment of ligustrazine as control) of six rats each. The in vitro experiments in rat liver microsomes were performed to explore the effect of ligustrazine on the metabolic stability of valsartan. Results Ligustrazine changed the pharmacokinetic profile of valsartan. In the presence of 4 mg/kg ligustrazine, the AUC(0-t) (385.37 +- 93.05 versus 851.64 +- 104.26 mug/L*h), t1/2 (5.46 +- 0.93 versus 6.34 +- 1.25 h), and Cmax (62.64 +- 9.09 versus 83.87 +- 6.15 mug/L) of valsartan was significantly decreased, and the clearance rate was increased from 10.92 +- 1.521 to 25.76 +- 6.24 L/h/kg and similar changes were observed in the group with 10 mg/kg ligustrazine (p < 0.05). The metabolic stability of valsartan was also decreased by ligustrazine as the half-life of valsartan in rat liver microsomes decreased from 37.12 +- 4.06 to 33.48 +- 3.56 min and the intrinsic clearance rate increased from 37.34 +- 3.84 to 41.40 +- 4.32 muL/min/mg protein (p < 0.05). Discussion and conclusions  Ligustrazine promoted the metabolism of valsartan via activating CYP3A4. The co-administration of ligustrazine and valsartan should be taken into account.
33355515/Roots and stems of Kadsura coccinea extract induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos/larvae through apoptosis and oxidative stress Abstract Context Although the roots and stems of Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A. C. Smith. [Schisandraceae] are herbs and traditional foods in Li nationality, its toxicity remains unclear. Objective To study developmental toxicity of K. coccinea consumption and explain underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods Zebrafish were applied to assess LC50 values of hydroethanol extract (KCH) and water extract (KCW) of Kadsura coccinea. In further study, three concentrations groups of KCH (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mug/mL for embryo, 7.5, 15 and 30 mug/mL for larvae) and control group (n = 30) were administered. At specific stages of zebrafish development, spontaneous movement, hatching rate, etc., were measured. Gene expressions related to developmental toxicity were examined. Results The LC50 value of KCH (24 or 45 mug/mL) was lower than KCW (1447 or 2011 mug/mL) in embryos or larvae. The inhibited spontaneous movement (20%), hatching rate (20%), body length (12%) and eye area (30%) were observed after KCH treatment. Moreover, the decreased liver areas (25%) and fluorescence intensity (33%), increased ALT (37%) and AST levels (42%) were found in larvae treated with KCH (30 mug/mL). The increased ROS (89%), MDA concentrations (30%), apoptosis generation (62%) and decreased T-SOD activity (16%) were also observed. The represented genes of developmental hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in zebrafish were activated after KCH (15 or 30 mug/mL) treatment. Discussion and conclusions These results demonstrate that KCH has developmental toxicity on zebrafish. Our study provides a scientific basis for further research on the toxicity of Kadsura coccinea.
33381270/Bisphenol A and Its Analogues in Chinese Total Diets: Contaminated Levels and Risk Assessment Bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues (BPs) are suspected posing potential endocrine disrupting properties. They might migrate into foodstuffs through food packaging materials or contaminated water and soil. Dietary exposure is of paramount importance way for human health. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) lowered the value of tolerable daily intake (TDI) from 50 mug/kg bw/day (d) to a temporary (t) TDI (t-TDI) of 4 mug/kg bw/d. In this study, the Chinese total dietary samples were analyzed for assessing the exposure risk of BPs by diets. BPA, bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol AF (BPAF) were found in 12 kinds of food samples except for bisphenol B (BPB). A deterministic approach was used to calculate the dietary intakes of 4 kinds of compounds. For different age and gender groups, the exposure levels of BPA (178.440-403.672 ng/kg bw/d) was the highest, followed by BPS (21.372-52.112 ng/kg bw/d), BPF (20.641-50.507 ng/kg bw/d), and BPAF (0.434-1.210 ng/kg bw/d). Based on the t-TDI set by EFSA (4 mug/kg bw/d for BPA), the BPs through dietary intake pose low risks on the Chinese general population even summarization exposure levels of different BPs. However, human can be exposed to multiple endocrine disrupting chemicals rather than BPs alone; combined exposure risks should be further considered.
33260661/Glycosaminoglycans and Contrast Agents: The Role of Hyaluronic Acid as MRI Contrast Enhancer A comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) combined with imaging or therapeutic agents can be a key factor for the rational design of drug delivery and diagnostic systems. In this work, physical and thermodynamic phenomena arising from the complex interplay between GAGs and contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been explored. Being an excellent candidate for drug delivery and diagnostic systems, Hyaluronic acid (HA) (0.1 to 0.7%w/v) has been chosen as a GAG model, and Gd-DTPA (0.01 to 0.2 mM) as a relevant MRI contrast agent. HA samples crosslinked with divinyl sulfone (DVS) have also been investigated. Water Diffusion and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry studies demonstrated that the interaction between HA and Gd-DTPA can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate water molecules, which plays a leading role in determining both the polymer conformation and the relaxometric properties of the contrast agent. This interaction can be modulated by changing the GAG/contrast agent molar ratio and by acting on the organization of the polymer network. The fine control over the combination of GAGs and imaging agents could represent an enormous advantage in formulating novel multifunctional diagnostic probes paving the way for precision nanomedicine tools.
33255306/Antiproliferative, Antimicrobial and Antiviral Activity of beta-Aryl-delta-iodo-gamma-lactones, Their Effect on Cellular Oxidative Stress Markers and Biological Membranes The aim of this work was the examination of biological activity of three selected racemic cis-beta-aryl-delta-iodo-gamma-lactones. Tested iodolactones differed in the structure of the aromatic fragment of molecule, bearing isopropyl (1), methyl (2), or no substituent (3) on the para position of the benzene ring. A broad spectrum of biological activity as antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, cytotoxic, antioxidant, and hemolytic activity was examined. All iodolactones showed bactericidal activity against Proteus mirabilis, and lactones 1,2 were active against Bacillus cereus. The highest cytotoxic activity towards HeLa and MCF7 cancer cell lines and NHDF normal cell line was found for lactone 1. All assessed lactones significantly disrupted antioxidative/oxidative balance of the NHDF, and the most harmful effect was determined by lactone 1. Contrary to lactone 1, lactones 2 and 3 did not induce the hemolysis of erythrocytes after 48 h of incubation. The differences in activity of iodolactones 1-3 in biological tests may be explained by their different impact on physicochemical properties of membrane as the packing order in the hydrophilic area and fluidity of hydrocarbon chains. This was dependent on the presence and type of alkyl substituent. The highest effect on the membrane organization was observed for lactone 1 due to the presence of bulky isopropyl group on the benzene ring.
33256040/Separation and Purification of Biogenic 1,3-Propanediol from Fermented Glycerol through Flocculation and Strong Acidic Ion-Exchange Resin In the present work, was investigated the separation and purification procedure of the biogenic 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), which is a well-known valuable compound in terms of bio-based plastic materials development. The biogenic 1,3-PD was obtained as a major metabolite through the glycerol fermentation by Klebsiella pneumoniae DSMZ 2026 and was subjected to separation and purification processes. A strong acidic ion exchange resin in H+ form was used for 1,3-PD purification from the aqueous solution previously obtained by broth flocculation. The eluent volume was investigated considering the removal of the secondary metabolites such as organic acids (acetic, citric, lactic, and succinic acids) and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), and unconsumed glycerol. It was observed that a volume of 84 mL of ethanol 75% loaded with a flow rate of 7 mL/min completely remove the secondary metabolites from 10 mL of concentrated fermented broth, and pure biogenic 1,3-PD was recovered in 128 mL of the eluent.
33256210/Quantitative and Qualitative Identification of Bioactive Compounds in Edible Flowers of Black and Bristly Locust and Their Antioxidant Activity Black and bristly locust flowers are an excellent source of polyphenols, including flavonols, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins. In the present literature, there is a lack of studies showing the quantity and quality of phenolic compounds from different locust flowers. There are a few studies on the status of polyphenols in black locust flowers and their products but not bristly locusts. The aims of this study were to analyze and compare the concentrations of bioactive compounds from Robinia pseudoacacia and Robinia hispida flowers over two years. These two species of plants from six independent locations (parks and green areas) located in Warsaw were assessed in this study. The dry matter and polyphenol contents of the flowers were determined. Black locust flower samples contained significantly more myricetin and luteolin. Only bristly locust flowers contained anthocyanins. Five individual anthocyanins were identified in the pink-colored bristly locust flowers. Pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were the predominant forms in the pool of total anthocyanins.
33255682/TORC2-Dependent Ypk1-Mediated Phosphorylation of Lam2/Ltc4 Disrupts Its Association with the beta-Propeller Protein Laf1 at Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Membrane-tethered sterol-binding Lam/Ltc proteins localize at junctions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and other organelles. Two of the six family members:Lam2/Ltc4 (initially Ysp2) and paralog Lam4/Ltc3:localize to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites (CSs) and mediate retrograde ergosterol transport from the PM to the ER. Our prior work demonstrated that Lam2 and Lam4 are substrates of TORC2-regulated protein kinase Ypk1, that Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits their function in retrograde sterol transport, and that PM sterol retention bolsters cell survival under stressful conditions. At ER-PM CSs, Lam2 and Lam4 associate with Laf1/Ymr102c and Dgr2/Ykl121w (paralogous WD40 repeat-containing proteins) that reportedly bind sterol. Using fluorescent tags, we found that Lam2 and Lam4 remain at ER-PM CSs when Laf1 and Dgr2 are absent, whereas neither Laf1 nor Dgr2 remain at ER-PM CSs when Lam2 and Lam4 are absent. Loss of Laf1 (but not Dgr2) impedes retrograde ergosterol transport, and a laf1  mutation does not exacerbate the transport defect of lam2  lam4  cells, indicating a shared function. Lam2 and Lam4 bind Laf1 and Dgr2 in vitro in a pull-down assay, and the PH domain in Lam2 hinders its interaction with Laf1. Lam2 phosphorylated by Ypk1, and Lam2 with phosphomimetic (Glu) replacements at its Ypk1 sites, exhibited a marked reduction in Laf1 binding. Thus, phosphorylation prevents Lam2 interaction with Laf1 at ER-PM CSs, providing a mechanism by which Ypk1 action inhibits retrograde sterol transport.
33255475/Polyamines Counteract Carbonate-Driven Proteasome Stalling in Alkaline Conditions Cancer cells tend to increase intracellular pH and, at the same time, are known to intensively produce and uptake polyamines such as spermine. Here, we show that various amines, including biogenic polyamines, boost the activity of proteasomes in a dose-dependent manner. Proteasome activity in the classical amine-containing buffers, such as 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), Tris, (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), glycylglycine, bis-Tris propane, and bicine, has a skewed distribution with a maximum at pH of 7.0-8.0. The activity of proteasomes in buffers containing imidazole and bis-Tris is maintained almost on the same level, in the pH range of 6.5-8.5. The third type of activation is observed in buffers based on the amino acids arginine and ornithine, as well as the natural polyamines spermine and spermidine. Proteasome activity in these buffers is dramatically increased at pH values greater than 7.5. Anionic buffers such as phosphate or carbonate, in contrast, inhibit proteasome activity during alkalization. Importantly, supplementation of a carbonate-phosphate buffer with spermine counteracts carbonate-driven proteasome stalling in alkaline conditions, predicting an additional physiological role of polyamines in maintaining the metabolism and survival of cancer cells.
33255269/A Representative GIIA Phospholipase A2 Activates Preadipocytes to Produce Inflammatory Mediators Implicated in Obesity Development Adipose tissue secretes proinflammatory mediators which promote systemic and adipose tissue inflammation seen in obesity. Group IIA (GIIA)-secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) enzymes are found to be elevated in plasma and adipose tissue from obese patients and are active during inflammation, generating proinflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 exerts anti-lipolytic actions and increases triacylglycerol levels in adipose tissue. However, the inflammatory actions of GIIA sPLA2s in adipose tissue cells and mechanisms leading to increased PGE2 levels in these cells are unclear. This study investigates the ability of a representative GIIA sPLA2, MT-III, to activate proinflammatory responses in preadipocytes, focusing on the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, adipocytokines and mechanisms involved in these effects. Our results showed that MT-III induced biosynthesis of PGE2, PGI2, MCP-1, IL-6 and gene expression of leptin and adiponectin in preadipocytes. The MT-III-induced PGE2 biosynthesis was dependent on cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2)-alpha, cyclooxygenases (COX)-1 and COX-2 pathways and regulated by a positive loop via the EP4 receptor. Moreover, MT-III upregulated COX-2 and microsomal prostaglandin synthase (mPGES)-1 protein expression. MCP-1 biosynthesis induced by MT-III was dependent on the EP4 receptor, while IL-6 biosynthesis was dependent on EP3 receptor engagement by PGE2. These data highlight preadipocytes as targets for GIIA sPLA2s and provide insight into the roles played by this group of sPLA2s in obesity.
33260301/The Release of a Soluble Glycosylated Protein from Glycogen by Recombinant Lysosomal alpha-Glucosidase (rhGAA) In Vitro and Its Presence in Serum In Vivo In studies on the degradation of glycogen by rhGAA, a glycosylated protein core material was found which consists of about 5-6% of the total starting glycogen. There was an additional 25% of the glycogen unaccounted for based on glucose released. After incubation of glycogen with rhGAA until no more glucose was released, no other carbohydrate was detected on HPAEC-PAD. Several oligosaccharides are then detectable if the medium is first boiled in 0.1 N HCl or incubated with trypsin. It is present in serum either in an HCl extract or in a trypsin digest. The characteristics of the in vivo serum material are identical to the material in the in vitro incubation medium. One oligosaccharide cannot be further degraded by rhGAA, from the incubation medium as well as from serum co-elute on HPAEC-PAD. Several masked oligosaccharides in serum contain m-inositol, e-inositol, and sorbitol as the major carbohydrates. The presence of this glycosylated protein in serum is a fraction of glycogen that is degraded outside the lysosome and the cell. The glycosylated protein in the serum is not present in the serum of Pompe mice not on ERT, but it is present in the serum of Pompe disease patients who are on ERT, so it is a biomarker of GAA degradation of lysosomal glycogen.
33255314/Identifying Genes Involved in Alkaloid Biosynthesis in Vinca minor through Transcriptomics and Gene Co-Expression Analysis The lesser periwinkle Vinca minor accumulates numerous monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) including the vasodilator vincamine. While the biosynthetic pathway of MIAs has been largely elucidated in other Apocynaceae such as Catharanthus roseus, the counterpart in V. minor remains mostly unknown, especially for reactions leading to MIAs specific to this plant. As a consequence, we generated a comprehensive V. minor transcriptome elaborated from eight distinct samples including roots, old and young leaves exposed to low or high light exposure conditions. This optimized resource exhibits an improved completeness compared to already published ones. Through homology-based searches using C. roseus genes as bait, we predicted candidate genes for all common steps of the MIA pathway as illustrated by the cloning of a tabersonine/vincadifformine 16-O-methyltransferase (Vm16OMT) isoform. The functional validation of this enzyme revealed its capacity of methylating 16-hydroxylated derivatives of tabersonine, vincadifformine and lochnericine with a Km 0.94 +- 0.06 microM for 16-hydroxytabersonine. Furthermore, by combining expression of fusions with yellow fluorescent proteins and interaction assays, we established that Vm16OMT is located in the cytosol and forms homodimers. Finally, a gene co-expression network was performed to identify candidate genes of the missing V. minor biosynthetic steps to guide MIA pathway elucidation.
33255743/Chemical Composition of Sour Beer Resulting from Supplementation the Fermentation Medium with Magnesium and Zinc Ions The bioavailability of minerals, such as zinc and magnesium, has a significant impact on the fermentation process. These metal ions are known to influence the growth and metabolic activity of yeast, but there are few reports on their effects on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) metabolism during sour brewing. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of magnesium and zinc ions on the metabolism of Lactobacillus brevis WLP672 during the fermentation of brewers' wort. We carried out lactic acid fermentations using wort with different mineral compositions: without supplementation; supplemented with magnesium at 60 mg/L and 120 mg/L; and supplemented with zinc at 0.4 mg/L and 2 mg/L. The concentration of organic acids, pH of the wort and carbohydrate use was determined during fermentation, while aroma compounds, real extract and ethanol were measured after the mixed fermentation. The addition of magnesium ions resulted in the pH of the fermenting wort decreasing more quickly, an increase in the level of L-lactic acid (after 48 h of fermentation) and increased concentrations of some volatile compounds. While zinc supplementation had a negative impact on the L. brevis strain, resulting in a decrease in the L-lactic acid content and a higher pH in the beer. We conclude that zinc supplementation is not recommended in sour beer production using L. brevis WLP672.
33271968/New Trends for Antimalarial Drugs: Synergism between Antineoplastics and Antimalarials on Breast Cancer Cells Chemotherapy plays a key role in breast cancer therapy, but drug resistance and unwanted side effects make the treatment less effective. We propose a new combination model that combines antineoplastic drugs and antimalarials for breast cancer therapy. Cytotoxic effects of two antineoplastic agents alone and in combination with several antimalarials on MCF-7 tumor cell line was evaluated. Different concentrations in a fixed ratio were added to the cultured cells and incubated for 48 h. Cell viability was evaluated using MTT and SRB assays. Synergism was evaluated using the Chou-Talalay method. The results indicate doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX) alone at concentrations of their IC50 and higher are cell growth inhibitors. Mefloquine, artesunate, and chloroquine at concentrations of their IC50 demonstrate anti-cancer activity. In combination, almost all antimalarials demonstrate higher ability than DOX and PTX alone to decrease cell viability at concentrations of IC50 and lower than their IC50. The combination of chloroquine, artesunate and mefloquine with DOX and PTX was synergic (CI < 1). The combination of DOX and mefloquine after 48 h incubation demonstrated the highest cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells, and the combination of DOX and artesunate was the most synergic. These results suggest antimalarials could act synergistically with DOX/PTX for breast cancer therapy. 
33276570/Chemical Diversity of Soft Coral Steroids and Their Pharmacological Activities The review is devoted to the chemical diversity of steroids produced by soft corals and their determined and potential activities. There are about 200 steroids that belong to different types of steroids such as secosteroids, spirosteroids, epoxy- and peroxy-steroids, steroid glycosides, halogenated steroids, polyoxygenated steroids and steroids containing sulfur or nitrogen heteroatoms. Of greatest interest is the pharmacological activity of these steroids. More than 40 steroids exhibit antitumor and related activity with a confidence level of over 90 percent. A group of 32 steroids shows anti-hypercholesterolemic activity with over 90 percent confidence. Ten steroids exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and 20 steroids can be classified as respiratory analeptic drugs. Several steroids exhibit rather rare and very specific activities. Steroids exhibit anti-osteoporotic properties and can be used to treat osteoporosis, as well as have strong anti-eczemic and anti-psoriatic properties and antispasmodic properties. Thus, this review is probably the first and exclusive to present the known as well as the potential pharmacological activities of 200 marine steroids.
33271940/Acylpolyamine Mygalin as a TLR4 Antagonist Based on Molecular Docking and In Vitro Analyses Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins that are key regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses, particularly TLR4, and they have been identified as potential drug targets for the treatment of disease. Several low-molecular-weight compounds are being considered as new drug targets for various applications, including as immune modulators. Mygalin, a 417 Da synthetic bis-acylpolyamine, is an analog of spermidine that has microbicidal activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of mygalin on the innate immune response based on a virtual screening (VS) and molecular docking analysis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages and the cell lines J774A.1 and RAW 264.7 stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to confirm the data obtained in silico. Virtual screening and molecular docking suggested that mygalin binds to TLR4 via the protein myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) and LPS. Macrophages stimulated by mygalin plus LPS showed suppressed gene expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukine 6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as inhibition of signaling protein p65 of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), resulting in decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-alpha. These results indicate that mygalin has anti-inflammatory potential, being an attractive option to be explored. In addition, we reinforce the importance of virtual screening analysis to assist in the discovery of new drugs.
33276611/Tackling Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence by Mulinane-Like Diterpenoids from Azorella atacamensis Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important multidrug-resistant human pathogen by dint of its high intrinsic, acquired, and adaptive resistance mechanisms, causing great concern for immune-compromised individuals and public health. Additionally, P. aeruginosa resilience lies in the production of a myriad of virulence factors, which are known to be tightly regulated by the quorum sensing (QS) system. Anti-virulence therapy has been adopted as an innovative alternative approach to circumvent bacterial antibiotic resistance. Since plants are known repositories of natural phytochemicals, herein, we explored the anti-virulence potential of Azorella atacamensis, a medicinal plant from the Taira Atacama community (Calama, Chile), against P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, A. atacamensis extract (AaE) conferred a significant protection for human lung cells and Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes towards P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. The production of key virulence factors was decreased upon AaE exposure without affecting P. aeruginosa growth. In addition, AaE was able to decrease QS-molecules production. Furthermore, metabolite profiling of AaE and its derived fractions achieved by combination of a molecular network and in silico annotation allowed the putative identification of fourteen diterpenoids bearing a mulinane-like skeleton. Remarkably, this unique interesting group of diterpenoids seems to be responsible for the interference with virulence factors as well as on the perturbation of membrane homeostasis of P. aeruginosa. Hence, there was a significant increase in membrane stiffness, which appears to be modulated by the cell wall stress response ECFsigma SigX, an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor involved in membrane homeostasis as well as P. aeruginosa virulence.
33276555/Biochemical Pathways Leading to the Formation of Wyosine Derivatives in tRNA of Archaea Tricyclic wyosine derivatives are present at position 37 in tRNAPhe of both eukaryotes and archaea. In eukaryotes, five different enzymes are needed to form a final product, wybutosine (yW). In archaea, 4-demethylwyosine (imG-14) is an intermediate for the formation of three different wyosine derivatives, yW-72, imG, and mimG. In this review, current knowledge regarding the archaeal enzymes involved in this process and their reaction mechanisms are summarized. The experiments aimed to elucidate missing steps in biosynthesis pathways leading to the formation of wyosine derivatives are suggested. In addition, the chemical synthesis pathways of archaeal wyosine nucleosides are discussed, and the scheme for the formation of yW-86 and yW-72 is proposed. Recent data demonstrating that wyosine derivatives are present in the other tRNA species than those specific for phenylalanine are discussed.
33287108/Optimization of Polyhydroxybutyrate Production by Amazonian Microalga Stigeoclonium sp. B23 The present work established the optimization and production of biodegradable thermoplastic polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from Amazonian microalga Stigeoclonium sp. B23. The optimization was performed in eight different growth media conditions of Stigeoclonium sp. B23, supplemented with sodium acetate and sodium bicarbonate and total deprivation of sodium nitrate. B23 was stained with Nile Red, and PHB was extracted and quantified by correlating the amount of fluorescence and biopolymer concentration through spectrofluorimetry and spectrophotometry, respectively. Our results detected the production of PHB in Stigeoclonium sp. B23 and in all modified media. Treatment with increased acetate and bicarbonate and without nitrate gave the highest concentration of PHB, while the treatment with only acetate gave the lowest among supplemented media. Our results showed a great potential of Stigeoclonium sp. B23, the first Amazonian microalga reported on PHB production. The microalga was isolated from a poorly explored and investigated region and proved to be productive when compared to other cyanobacterial and bacterial species. Additionally, microalga biomass changes due to the nutritional conditions and, reversely, biopolymer is well-synthetized. This great potential could lead to the pursuit of new Amazonian microalgae species in the search for alternative polyesters.
33287322/Alginate-Halloysite Nanocomposite Aerogel: Preparation, Structure, and Oil/Water Separation Applications Environmental remediation using green approaches for addressing various pollution-related issues, especially water pollution, is in high demand. Here, we designed an environmentally friendly, low-cost, and stable sodium alginate-halloysite clay composite aerogel (SAHA) for oil/water separation via a two-step synthesis procedure, including ionic crosslinking and freeze-drying. The as-prepared SAHA aerogels were characterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Characterization of the SAHA aerogels revealed a three-dimensional porous microstructure with uniformly dispersed halloysite nanotubes (HA) within the alginate matrix. The elemental composition of the hydrogels investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) revealed the presence of minerals, such as magnesium, sodium, aluminum, and silicon in the SAHA aerogels. The presence of a hydrophilic alginate matrix combined with these unique morphological characteristics resulted in SAHA aerogels with underwater oleophobicity and excellent oil/water separation efficiency (up to 99.7%). The ease of fabrication, excellent oil/water separation, and multiple performances make the SAHA aerogel an interesting candidate for practical applications in water recycling.
33287405/Physiological, Transcriptomic, and Metabolic Responses of Ginkgo biloba L. to Drought, Salt, and Heat Stresses Ginkgo biloba L. is highly adaptable and resistant to a range of abiotic stressors, allowing its growth in various environments. However, it is unclear how G. biloba responds to common environmental stresses. We explored the physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolic responses of G. biloba to short-term drought, salt, and heat stresses. Proline, H2O2, and ABA contents, along with CAT activity, increased under all three types of stress. SOD activity increased under salt and heat stresses, while soluble protein and IAA contents decreased under drought and salt stresses. With respect to metabolites, D-glyceric acid increased in response to drought and salt stresses, whereas isomaltose 1, oxalamide, and threonine 2 increased under drought. Piceatannol 2,4-hydroxybutyrate and 1,3-diaminopropane increased under salt stress, whereas 4-aminobutyric acid 1 and galactonic acid increased in response to heat stress. Genes regulating nitrogen assimilation were upregulated only under drought, while the GRAS gene was upregulated under all three types of stressors. ARF genes were downregulated under heat stress, whereas genes encoding HSF and SPL were upregulated. Additionally, we predicted that miR156, miR160, miR172, and their target genes participate in stress responses. Our study provides valuable data for studying the multilevel response to drought, salinity, and heat in G. biloba.
33291563/Efficient Purification of R-phycoerythrin from Marine Algae (Porphyra yezoensis) Based on a Deep Eutectic Solvents Aqueous Two-Phase System R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), a marine bioactive protein, is abundant in Porphyra yezoensis with high protein content. In this study, R-PE was purified using a deep eutectic solvents aqueous two-phase system (DES-ATPS), combined with ammonium sulphate precipitation, and characterized by certain techniques. Firstly, choline chloride-urea (ChCl-U) was selected as the suitable DES to form ATPS for R-PE extraction. Then, single-factor experiments were conducted: the purity (A565/A280) of R-PE was 3.825, and the yield was 69.99% (w/w) under optimal conditions (adding 0.040 mg R-PE to ChCl-U (0.35 g)/K2HPO4 (0.8 g/mL, 0.5 mL) and extracting for 20 min). The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results revealed that the purified R-PE contained three main bands. One band was presented after purification in native-PAGE. The UV-vis spectra showed characteristic absorption peaks at 495, 540, and 565 nm. R-PE displayed an emission wavelength at 570 nm when excited at 495 nm. All spectra results illustrated that the structure of R-PE remained unchanged throughout the process, proving the effectiveness of this method. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that aggregation and surrounding phenomena were the driving forces for R-PE extraction. This study could provide a green and simple purification method of R-PE in drug development.
33291782/Structure Elucidation and Functional Studies of a Novel beta-hairpin Antimicrobial Peptide from the Marine Polychaeta Capitella teleta Endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are evolutionary ancient molecular factors of innate immunity that play a key role in host defense. Among the most active and stable under physiological conditions AMPs are the peptides of animal origin that adopt a beta-hairpin conformation stabilized by disulfide bridges. In this study, a novel BRICHOS-domain related AMP from the marine polychaeta Capitella teleta, named capitellacin, was produced as the recombinant analogue and investigated. The mature capitellacin exhibits high homology with the known beta-hairpin AMP family:tachyplesins and polyphemusins from the horseshoe crabs. The beta-hairpin structure of the recombinant capitellacin was proved by CD and NMR spectroscopy. In aqueous solution the peptide exists as monomeric right-handed twisted beta-hairpin and its structure does not reveal significant amphipathicity. Moreover, the peptide retains this conformation in membrane environment and incorporates into lipid bilayer. Capitellacin exhibits a strong antimicrobial activity in vitro against a wide panel of bacteria including extensively drug-resistant strains. In contrast to other known beta-hairpin AMPs, this peptide acts apparently via non-lytic mechanism at concentrations inhibiting bacterial growth. The molecular mechanism of the peptide antimicrobial action does not seem to be related to the inhibition of bacterial translation therefore other molecular targets may be assumed. The reduced cytotoxicity against human cells and high antibacterial cell selectivity as compared to tachyplesin-1 make it an attractive candidate compound for an anti-infective drug design.
33380901/Therapeutic Effect of Ginsenoside Rd on Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Model Mice: Regulation of Inflammation and Treg/Th17 Cell Balance Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease. Inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination of the CNS are the major characteristics of MS and its related animal model-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immoderate autoimmune responses of Th17 cells and dysfunction of Treg cells critically contribute to the pathogenesis of MS and EAE. Our previous study showed that Ginsenoside Rd effectively ameliorated the clinical severity in EAE mice, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of Ginsenoside Rd on EAE in vivo and in vitro and also explored the potential mechanisms for alleviating the injury of EAE. The results indicated that Ginsenoside Rd was effective for the treatment of EAE in mice and splenocytes. Ginsenoside Rd treatment on EAE mice ameliorated the severity of EAE and attenuated the characteristic signs of disease. Ginsenoside Rd displayed the therapeutic function to EAE by modulating inflammation and autoimmunity, via the downregulation of related proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17, upregulation of inhibitory cytokines TGF-beta and IL-10, and modulation of Treg/Th17 imbalance. And the Foxp3/RORgammat/JAK2/STAT3 signaling was found to be associated with this protective function. In addition, analysis of gut microbiota showed that Ginsenoside Rd also had modulation potential on gut microbiota in EAE mice. Based on this study, we hypothesize that Ginsenoside Rd could be a potential and promising agent for the treatment of MS.
33381268/The Associated Regulatory Mechanisms of Zinc Lactate in Redox Balance and Mitochondrial Function of Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cells Zinc lactate (ZnLA) is a new organic zinc salt which has antioxidant properties in mammals and can improve intestinal function. This study explored the effects of ZnLA and ZnSO4 on cell proliferation, Zn transport, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function, and their underlying molecular mechanisms in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). The results showed that addition of ZnLA promoted cell proliferation, inhibited cell apoptosis and IL-6 secretion, and upregulated the mRNA expression and concentration of MT-2B, ZNT-1, and CRIP, as well as affected the gene expression and activity of oxidation or antioxidant enzymes (e.g., CuZnSOD, CAT, and Gpx1, GSH-PX, LDH, and MDA), compared to ZnSO4 or control. Compared with the control, ZnLA treatment had no significant effect on mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas it markedly increased the mitochondrial basal OCR, nonmitochondrial respiratory capacity, and mitochondrial proton leakage and reduced spare respiratory capacity and mitochondrial reactive oxygen (ROS) production in IPEC-J2 cells. Furthermore, ZnLA treatment increased the protein expression of Nrf2 and phosphorylated AMPK, but reduced Keap1 and p62 protein expression and autophagy-related genes LC3B-1 and Beclin mRNA abundance. Under H2O2-induced oxidative stress conditions, ZnLA supplementation markedly reduced cell apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS levels in IPEC-J2 cells. Moreover, ZnLA administration increased the protein expression of Nrf2 and decreased the protein expression of caspase-3, Keap1, and p62 in H2O2-induced IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, when the activity of AMPK was inhibited by Compound C, ZnLA supplementation did not increase the protein expression of nuclear Nrf2, but when Compound C was removed, the activities of AMPK and Nfr2 were both increased by ZnLA treatment. Our results indicated that ZnLA could improve the antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial function in IPEC-J2 cells by activating the AMPK-Nrf2-p62 pathway under normal or oxidative stress conditions. Our novel finding also suggested that ZnLA, as a new feed additive for piglets, has the potential to be an alternative for ZnSO4.
33381272/Olaquindox-Induced Liver Damage Involved the Crosstalk of Oxidative Stress and p53 In Vivo and In Vitro Olaquindox (OLA), a member of the quinoxaline-N,N-dioxide family, has been widely used as a growth-promoting feed additive and treatment for bacterial infections. The toxicity has been a major concern, and the precise molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. The present study was aimed at investigating the roles of oxidative stress and p53 in OLA-caused liver damage. In a mouse model, OLA administration could markedly cause liver injury as well as the induction of oxidative stress and activation of p53. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited OLA-induced oxidative stress and p53 activation in vivo. Furthermore, knockout of the p53 gene could significantly inhibit OLA-induced liver damage by inhibiting oxidative stress and the mitochondria apoptotic pathway, compared to the p53 wild-type liver tissue. The cell model in vitro further demonstrated that p53 knockout or knockdown in the HCT116 cell and L02 cell significantly inhibited cell apoptosis and increased cell viability, presented by suppressing ROS production, oxidative stress, and the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Moreover, loss of p53 decreased OLA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activations, with the evidence of inhibited activation of phosphorylation- (p-) p38 and p-JNK and upregulated cell autophagy via activation of the LC3 and Beclin1 pathway in HCT116 and L02 cells. Taken together, our findings provided a support that p53 primarily played a proapoptotic role in OLA-induced liver damage against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which were largely dependent on suppression of the JNK/p38 pathway and upregulation of the autophagy pathway via activation of LC3 and Beclin1.
33322595/Development of Gas-Chromatographic Method for Simultaneous Determination of Cannabinoids and Terpenes in Hemp An original gas chromatographic method has been developed for simultaneous determination of major terpenes and cannabinoids in plant samples and their extracts. The main issues to be addressed were the large differences in polarity and volatility between both groups of analytes, but also the need for an exhaustive decarboxylation of cannabinoid acidic forms. Sample preparation was minimised, also by avoiding any analyte derivatisation. Acetone was found to be the most appropriate extraction solvent. Successful chromatographic separation was achieved by using a medium polarity column. Limits of detection ranged from 120 to 260 ng/mL for terpenes and from 660 to 860 ng/mL for cannabinoids. Parallel testing proved the results for cannabinoids are comparable to those obtained from established HPLC methods. Despite very large differences in concentrations between both analyte groups, a linear range between 1 and 100 microg/mL for terpenes and between 10 and 1500 microg/mL for cannabinoids was determined.
33316997/Synthesis of Supported Heterogeneous Catalysts by Laser Ablation of Metallic Palladium in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Medium To obtain a supported heterogeneous catalyst, laser ablation of metallic palladium in supercritical carbon dioxide was performed in the presence of a carrier, microparticles of gamma-alumina. The influence of the ablation process conditions:including supercritical fluid density, ablation, mixing time of the mixture, and laser wavelength:on the completeness and efficiency of the deposition of palladium particles on the surface of the carrier was studied. The obtained composites were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy using energy dispersive spectroscopy. We found that palladium particles were nanosized and had a narrow size distribution (2-8 nm). The synthesized composites revealed high activity as catalysts in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene.
33316885/Optical and Photoacoustic Properties of Laser-Ablated Silver Nanoparticles in a Carbon Dots Solution This study used the carbon dots solution for the laser ablation technique to fabricate silver nanoparticles. The ablation time range was from 5 min to 20 min. Analytical methods, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were used to categorize the prepared samples. The UV-visible and z-scan techniques provided optical parameters such as linear and nonlinear refractive indices in the range of 1.56759 to 1.81288 and 7.3769 x 10-10 cm2 W-1 to 9.5269 x 10-10 cm2 W-1 and the nonlinear susceptibility was measured in the range of 5.46 x 10-8 to 6.97 x 10-8 esu. The thermal effusivity of prepared samples, which were measured using the photoacoustic technique, were in the range of 0.0941 W s1/2 cm-2 K-1 to 0.8491 W s1/2 cm-2 K-1. The interaction of the prepared sample with fluoride was investigated using a Raman spectrometer. Consequently, the intensity of the Raman signal decreased with the increasing concentration of fluoride, and the detection limit is about 0.1 ppm. 
33317151/Citrate Supplementation Restores the Impaired Mineralisation Resulting from the Acidic Microenvironment: An In Vitro Study Chronic metabolic acidosis leads to bone-remodelling disorders based on excessive mineral matrix resorption and inhibition of bone formation, but also affects the homeostasis of citrate, which is an essential player in maintaining the acid-base balance and in driving the mineralisation process. This study aimed to investigate the impact of acidosis on the osteogenic properties of bone-forming cells and the effects of citrate supplementation in restoring the osteogenic features impaired by the acidic milieu. For this purpose, human mesenchymal stromal cells were cultured in an osteogenic medium and the extracellular matrix mineralisation was analysed at the micro- and nano-level, both in neutral and acidic conditions and after treatment with calcium citrate and potassium citrate. The acidic milieu significantly decreased the citrate release and hindered the organisation of the extracellular matrix, but the citrate supplementation increased collagen production and, particularly calcium citrate, promoted the mineralisation process. Moreover, the positive effect of citrate supplementation was observed also in the physiological microenvironment. This in vitro study proves that the mineral matrix organisation is influenced by citrate availability in the microenvironment surrounding bone-forming cells, thus providing a biological basis for using citrate-based supplements in the management of bone-remodelling disorders related to chronic low-grade acidosis.
33322773/Biobased Polymers via Radical Homopolymerization and Copolymerization of a Series of Terpenoid-Derived Conjugated Dienes with exo-Methylene and 6-Membered Ring A series of exo-methylene 6-membered ring conjugated dienes, which are directly or indirectly obtained from terpenoids, such as beta-phellandrene, carvone, piperitone, and verbenone, were radically polymerized. Although their radical homopolymerizations were very slow, radical copolymerizations proceeded well with various common vinyl monomers, such as methyl acrylate (MA), acrylonitrile (AN), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and styrene (St), resulting in copolymers with comparable incorporation ratios of bio-based cyclic conjugated monomer units ranging from 40 to 60 mol% at a 1:1 feed ratio. The monomer reactivity ratios when using AN as a comonomer were close to 0, whereas those with St were approximately 0.5 to 1, indicating that these diene monomers can be considered electron-rich monomers. Reversible addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) copolymerizations with MA, AN, MMA, and St were all successful when using S-cumyl-S'-butyl trithiocarbonate (CBTC) as the RAFT agent resulting in copolymers with controlled molecular weights. The copolymers obtained with AN, MMA, or St showed glass transition temperatures (Tg) similar to those of common vinyl polymers (Tg ~ 100  C), indicating that biobased cyclic structures were successfully incorporated into commodity polymers without losing good thermal properties.
33322722/Impact of Sucrose as Osmolyte on Molecular Dynamics of Mouse Acetylcholinesterase The enzyme model, mouse acetylcholinesterase, which exhibits its active site at the bottom of a narrow gorge, was investigated in the presence of different concentrations of sucrose to shed light on the protein and water dynamics in cholinesterases. The study was conducted by incoherent neutron scattering, giving access to molecular dynamics within the time scale of sub-nano to nanoseconds, in comparison with molecular dynamics simulations. With increasing sucrose concentration, we found non-linear effects, e.g., first a decrease in the dynamics at 5 wt% followed by a gain at 10 wt% sucrose. Direct comparisons with simulations permitted us to understand the following findings: at 5 wt%, sugar molecules interact with the protein surface through water molecules and damp the motions to reduce the overall protein mobility, although the motions inside the gorge are enhanced due to water depletion. When going to 10 wt% of sucrose, some water molecules at the protein surface are replaced by sugar molecules. By penetrating the protein surface, they disrupt some of the intra-protein contacts, and induce new ones, creating new pathways for correlated motions, and therefore, increasing the dynamics. This exhaustive study allowed for an explanation of the detail interactions leading to the observed non-linear behavior.
33322764/Changes in Feed Proanthocyanidin Profiles during Silage Production and Digestion by Lamb Proanthocyanidins are plant specialized metabolites which are beneficial to animal nutrition and health. This study determined how proanthocyanidin profiles of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) change during the forage conservation process and along the digestive tract of lamb. We determined soluble, protein- and fiber-bound proanthocyanidins by spectrophotometric methods and soluble proanthocyanidin profiles by UPLC-MS/MS. During the conservation process, the total proanthocyanidin contents reduced in both forages and the relative proportion of insoluble proanthocyanidins increased, especially in sainfoin. The soluble proanthocyanidins, their mean degree of polymerization and the relative prodelphinidin share declined in both feed species. In the abomasum of lambs fed sainfoin silage, most of the proanthocyanidins were in insoluble form bound to proteins and fibers, but in the small and large intestines, the proportion of soluble proanthocyanidins increased again. For lambs fed birdsfoot trefoil, the trend was not so clear as proanthocyanidins were already mainly soluble in the abomasum. Nevertheless, a large part of soluble proanthocyanidins was recovered in the digestive tract but could not be detected by the UPLC-MS/MS method used. This study suggests that proanthocyanidins have probably been metabolized in the digestive tract by the resident microbiota.
33322612/Therapeutic Effects of Gallic Acid in Regulating Senescence and Diabetes; an In Vitro Study Gallic acid (GA), a plant-derived ubiquitous secondary polyphenol metabolite, can be a useful dietary supplement. This in vitro study's primary purpose was to assess the anti-aging properties of GA using rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) cells, antidiabetic effects via pancreatic islet cells, and finally, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of this natural compound. REF and islet cells were isolated from fetuses and pancreas of rats, respectively. Then, several senescence-associated molecular and biochemical parameters, along with antidiabetic markers, were investigated. GA caused a significant decrease in the beta-galactosidase activity and reduced inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in REF cells. GA reduced the G0/G1 phase in senescent REF cells that led cells to G2/M. Besides, GA improved the function of the beta cells. Flow cytometry and spectrophotometric analysis showed that it reduces apoptosis via inhibiting caspase-9 activity. Taken together, based on the present findings, this polyphenol metabolite at low doses regulates different pathways of senescence and diabetes through its antioxidative stress potential and modulation of mitochondrial complexes activities.
33322602/Protective Effects of a Strawberry Ellagitannin-Rich Extract against Pro-Oxidative and Pro-Inflammatory Dysfunctions Induced by a High-Fat Diet in a Rat Model Due to the demonstrated intestinal microbial transformation of strawberry ellagitannins (ET) into bioactive metabolites, in the current study on rats, we hypothesised that the dietary addition of a strawberry ET-rich extract (S-ET) to a high-fat diet (HFD) would attenuate disturbances in the redox and lipid status as well as in the inflammatory response. We randomly distributed 48 Wistar rats into six groups and used two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the effects of two main factors:diet type (standard and high-fat) and ET dosage (without, low, and 3x higher):applied to rats for 4 weeks. In relation to the hypothesis, irrespective of the dosage, the dietary application of ET resulted in the desired attenuating effects in rats fed a HFD as manifested by decreased body weight gain, relative mass of the epididymal pad, hepatic fat, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations as well as desired modifications in the blood plasma parameters. These beneficial changes were enhanced by the high dietary addition of ET, which was associated with considerably higher concentrations of ET metabolites in the urine and plasma of rats. The results indicated that S-ET could be effectively used for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disturbances associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia, redox status imbalance, and inflammation.
33317019/The Effect of Low-Fat and Low-Carbohydrate Diets on Weight Loss and Lipid Levels: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Background: The rise in obesity has emphasised a focus on lifestyle and dietary habits. We aimed to address the debate between low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets and compare their effects on body weight, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol, and triglycerides in an adult population. Method: Medline and Web of Science were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets up to September 2019. Three independent reviewers extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. The meta-analysis was stratified by follow-up time using the random-effects models. Results: This meta-analysis of 38 studies assessed a total of 6499 adults. At 6-12 months, pooled analyses of mean differences of low-carbohydrate vs. low-fat diets favoured the low-carbohydrate diet for average weight change (mean difference -1.30 kg; 95% CI -2.02 to -0.57), HDL (0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08), and triglycerides (TG) (-0.10 mmol/L; -0.16 to -0.04), and favoured the low-fat diet for LDL (0.07 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12) and total cholesterol (0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18). Conclusion and Relevance: This meta-analysis suggests that low-carbohydrate diets are effective at improving weight loss, HDL and TG lipid profiles. However, this must be balanced with potential consequences of raised LDL and total cholesterol in the long-term.
33322617/The Importance of Strain (Preorganization) in Beryllium Bonds In order to explore the angular strain role on the ability of Be to form strong beryllium bonds, a theoretical study of the complexes of four beryllium derivatives of ortho closo-carboranes with eight molecules (CO, N2, NCH, CNH, OH2, SH2, NH3, and PH3) acting as Lewis bases has been carried out at the G4 computational level. The results for these complexes, which contain besides Be other electron-deficient elements, such as B, have been compared with the analogous ones formed by three beryllium salts (BeCl2, CO3Be and SO4Be) with the same set of Lewis bases. The results show the presence of large and positive values of the electrostatic potential associated to the beryllium atoms in the isolated four beryllium derivatives of ortho-carboranes, evidencing an intrinsically strong acidic nature. In addition, the LUMO orbital in these systems is also associated to the beryllium atom. These features led to short intermolecular distances and large dissociation energies in the complexes of the beryllium derivatives of ortho-carboranes with the Lewis bases. Notably, as a consequence of the special framework provided by the ortho-carboranes, some of these dissociation energies are larger than the corresponding beryllium bonds in the already strongly bound SO4Be complexes, in particular for N2 and CO bases. The localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (LMOEDA) shows that among the attractive terms associated with the dissociation energy, the electrostatic term is the most important one, except for the complexes with the two previously mentioned weakest bases (N2 and CO), where the polarization term dominates. Hence, these results contribute to further confirm the importance of bending on the beryllium environment leading to strong interactions through the formation of beryllium bonds.
33322389/Co-Solvent Selection for Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) of Phenolic Compounds from Labisia pumila A preliminary study was conducted to study the effects of different types and concentrations of co-solvents based on yield, composition and antioxidants capacity of extract prior to optimization studies of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of Labisia pumila (locally referred to as 'kacip fatimah'). The following co-solvents were studied prior to the optimization of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) technique: ethanol, water, methanol, as well as aqueous solutions of ethanol-water and methanol-water (50% and 70% v/v). By using the selected co-solvents, identification of phenolic acids (gallic acid, methyl gallate and caffeic acid) was determined by using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Then, the antioxidant capacity was evaluated by using three different assays: total phenolic content (TPC), ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and free radical-scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). SC-CO2 with 70% ethanol-water co-solvent was superior in terms of a higher combination of phenolic compounds extracted and antioxidants capacity. Overall, SC-CO2 with co-solvent 70% ethanol-water technique was efficient in extracting phenolic compounds from L. pumila, and thus the usage of this solvent system should be considered for further optimization studies.
33322680/The Application of a Plant Biostimulant Based on Seaweed and Yeast Extract Improved Tomato Fruit Development and Quality Plant biostimulants are under investigation as innovative products to improve plant production and fruit quality, without resulting in environmental and food contaminations. Here, the effects of the application of Expando, a biostimulant based on seaweed and yeast extracts, on plant productivity, fruit ripening times, and fruit quality of Solanum lycopersicum var. Micro-Tom were evaluated. After biostimulant treatment, a two-week reduction of ripening times and a concomitant enhancement of the production percentage during the earliest ripening times, in terms of both fruit yield (+110%) and size (+85%), were observed. Concerning fruit quality, proximate analysis showed that tomatoes treated with the biostimulant had better nutritional composition compared to untreated samples, since both the quality of unsatured fatty acids (C16:3omega3: +328%; C18:2omega6: -23%) and micronutrients essential for human health (Fe: +14%; Cu: +21%; Zn: +24%) were increased. From a nutraceutical point of view, despite strong changes in bioactive compound profile not being observed, an increase of the antioxidant properties was recorded in fruits harvested by plants treated with the biostimulant (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS): +38%; 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH): +11%). In conclusion, the biostimulant application was able to reduce the ripening times and fruit size, while slightly increasing nutritional and nutraceutical values, leading to more marketable tomato fruits.
33316948/beta-Carotene: Preventive Role for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity: A Review Carotenoids are vital antioxidants for plants and animals. They protect cells from oxidative events and act against the inflammatory process and carcinogenesis. Among the most abundant carotenoids in human and foods is beta-carotene. This carotenoid has the highest level of provitamin A activity, as it splits into two molecules of retinol through the actions of the cytosolic enzymes: beta-carotene-15,15'-monooxygenase (beta-carotene-15,15'-oxygenase 1) and beta-carotene-9',10'-dioxygenase (beta-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase 2). The literature supports the idea that beta-carotene acts against type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Due to the many processes involved in beta-carotene biosynthesis and metabolic function, little is known about such components, since many mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, our study concisely described the relationships between the consumption of carotenoids, with emphasis on beta-carotene, and obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated parameters in order to understand the preventive role of carotenoids better and encourage their consumption.
33361122/A Novel High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound-Treated Herpes Simplex Virus 2 Vaccine Induces Long-Term Protective Immunity against Lethal Challenge in Mice High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is mainly used in tumor ablation and tumor vaccinology study. It has been shown to induce immune sensitization and enhance tumor responsiveness to other therapies. ABSTRACT High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), a noninvasive ablation therapy that has been widely used clinically in ablation of solid tumors, induces immune sensitization. We therefore in this study investigated whether HIFU treatment could enhance the efficacy of a herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) vaccine. First, we observed that in HSV-2-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II patients, HIFU treatment induced significantly higher anti-HSV-2 neutralization response than surgical removal. Next, we tested the efficacy of HIFU-treated, UV-inactivated HSV-2-infected cells as a proof-of-concept vaccine in mice. Our data showed that HIFU-treated formulation significantly enhanced HSV-2 antibody titers and neutralization titers, compared to UV-, microwave (MW)-, or freeze-thaw (FT)-treated formulations. HIFU treatment also promoted the Th1/2 cell-mediated response. A long-term full protection was observed in mice that received the HIFU-treated formulation, and no weight loss was detected. Our findings indicate that the novel application of HIFU in vaccine production may represent a rational way to improve vaccine efficacy. IMPORTANCE High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is mainly used in tumor ablation and tumor vaccinology study. It has been shown to induce immune sensitization and enhance tumor responsiveness to other therapies. Our study has shown enhanced anti-HSV-2 response in HIFU-treated CIN II patients. Furthermore, in a murine model, we have demonstrated that HIFU-treated HSV-2 vaccine induced long-term protective immunity against lethal challenge. Our findings indicate that the novel application of HIFU in vaccine production may represent a rational way to improve vaccine efficacy.
33361126/Crucial Role of ppGpp in the Resilience of Escherichia coli to Growth Disruption The capacity of microbes to resist and overcome environmental insults, known as resilience, allows them to survive in changing environments but also to resist antibiotic and biocide treatments and immune system responses. Although the role of the stringent response in bacterial resilience to nutritional stresses has been well studied, little is known about its importance in the ability of the bacteria to not just resist but also recover from these disturbances. ABSTRACT Bacteria grow in constantly changing environments that can suddenly become completely depleted of essential nutrients. The stringent response, a rewiring of the cellular metabolism mediated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp, plays a crucial role in adjusting bacterial growth to the severity of the nutritional stress. The ability of (p)ppGpp to trigger a slowdown of cell growth or induce bacterial dormancy has been widely investigated. However, little is known about the role of (p)ppGpp in promoting growth recovery after severe growth inhibition. In this study, we performed a time-resolved analysis of (p)ppGpp metabolism in Escherichia coli as it recovered from a sudden slowdown in growth. The results show that E. coli recovers by itself from the growth disruption provoked by the addition of serine hydroxamate, the serine analogue that we used to induce the stringent response. Growth inhibition was accompanied by a severe disturbance of metabolic activity and, more surprisingly, a transient overflow of valine and alanine. Our data also show that ppGpp is crucial for growth recovery since in the absence of ppGpp, E. coli's growth recovery was slower. In contrast, an increased concentration of pppGpp was found to have no significant effect on growth recovery. Interestingly, the observed decrease in intracellular ppGpp levels in the recovery phase correlated with bacterial growth, and the main effect involved in the return to the basal level was identified by flux calculation as growth dilution. This report thus significantly expands our knowledge of (p)ppGpp metabolism in E. coli physiology. IMPORTANCE The capacity of microbes to resist and overcome environmental insults, known as resilience, allows them to survive in changing environments but also to resist antibiotic and biocide treatments and immune system responses. Although the role of the stringent response in bacterial resilience to nutritional stresses has been well studied, little is known about its importance in the ability of the bacteria to not just resist but also recover from these disturbances. To address this important question, we investigated growth disruption resilience in the model bacterium Escherichia coli and its dependence on the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp by quantifying ppGpp and pppGpp levels as growth was disrupted and then recovered. Our findings may thus contribute to understanding how ppGpp improves E. coli's resilience to nutritional stress and other environmental insults.
33361129/The Two-Component System CopRS Maintains Subfemtomolar Levels of Free Copper in the Periplasm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Using a Phosphatase-Based Mechanism Copper is a micronutrient required as cofactor in redox enzymes. When free, copper is toxic, mismetallating proteins and generating damaging free radicals. ABSTRACT Two-component systems control periplasmic Cu+ homeostasis in Gram-negative bacteria. In characterized systems such as Escherichia coli CusRS, upon Cu+ binding to the periplasmic sensing region of CusS, a cytoplasmic phosphotransfer domain of the sensor phosphorylates the response regulator CusR. This drives the expression of efflux transporters, chaperones, and redox enzymes to ameliorate metal toxic effects. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa two-component sensor histidine kinase CopS exhibits a Cu-dependent phosphatase activity that maintains CopR in a nonphosphorylated state when the periplasmic Cu levels are below the activation threshold of CopS. Upon Cu+ binding to the sensor, the phosphatase activity is blocked and the phosphorylated CopR activates transcription of the CopRS regulon. Supporting the model, mutagenesis experiments revealed that the DeltacopS strain exhibits maximal expression of the CopRS regulon, lower intracellular Cu+ levels, and increased Cu tolerance compared to wild-type cells. The invariant phosphoacceptor residue His235 of CopS was not required for the phosphatase activity itself but was necessary for its Cu dependency. To sense the metal, the periplasmic domain of CopS binds two Cu+ ions at its dimeric interface. Homology modeling of CopS based on CusS structure (four Ag+ binding sites) clearly supports the different binding stoichiometries in the two systems. Interestingly, CopS binds Cu+/2+ with 3 x 10-14 M affinity, pointing to the absence of free (hydrated) Cu+/2+ in the periplasm. IMPORTANCE Copper is a micronutrient required as cofactor in redox enzymes. When free, copper is toxic, mismetallating proteins and generating damaging free radicals. Consequently, copper overload is a strategy that eukaryotic cells use to combat pathogens. Bacteria have developed copper-sensing transcription factors to control copper homeostasis. The cell envelope is the first compartment that has to cope with copper stress. Dedicated two-component systems control the periplasmic response to metal overload. This paper shows that the sensor kinase of the copper-sensing two-component system present in Pseudomonadales exhibits a signal-dependent phosphatase activity controlling the activation of its cognate response regulator, distinct from previously described periplasmic Cu sensors. Importantly, the data show that the system is activated by copper levels compatible with the absence of free copper in the cell periplasm. These observations emphasize the diversity of molecular mechanisms that have evolved in bacteria to manage the copper cellular distribution.
33322801/Characterization of alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors from Psychotria malayana Jack Leaves Extract Using LC-MS-Based Multivariate Data Analysis and In-Silico Molecular Docking Psychotria malayana Jack has traditionally been used to treat diabetes. Despite its potential, the scientific proof in relation to this plant is still lacking. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in P. malayana leaf extracts using a metabolomics approach and to elucidate the ligand-protein interactions through in silico techniques. The plant leaves were extracted with methanol and water at five various ratios (100, 75, 50, 25 and 0% v/v; water-methanol). Each extract was tested for alpha-glucosidase inhibition, followed by analysis using liquid chromatography tandem to mass spectrometry. The data were further subjected to multivariate data analysis by means of an orthogonal partial least square in order to correlate the chemical profile and the bioactivity. The loading plots revealed that the m/z signals correspond to the activity of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which led to the identification of three putative bioactive compounds, namely 5'-hydroxymethyl-1'-(1, 2, 3, 9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo (2, 1-b) quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1'-one (1), alpha-terpinyl-beta-glucoside (2), and machaeridiol-A (3). Molecular docking of the identified inhibitors was performed using Auto Dock Vina software against the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isomaltase (Protein Data Bank code: 3A4A). Four hydrogen bonds were detected in the docked complex, involving several residues, namely ASP352, ARG213, ARG442, GLU277, GLN279, HIE280, and GLU411. Compound 1, 2, and 3 showed binding affinity values of -8.3, -7.6, and -10.0 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicate the good binding ability of the compounds towards the enzyme when compared to that of quercetin, a known alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. The three identified compounds that showed potential binding affinity towards the enzymatic protein in molecular docking interactions could be the bioactive compounds associated with the traditional use of this plant. 
33322446/CoMnO2-Decorated Polyimide-Based Carbon Fiber Electrodes for Wire-Type Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications In this work, we report the carbon fiber-based wire-type asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The highly conductive carbon fibers were prepared by the carbonized and graphitized process using the polyimide (PI) as a carbon fiber precursor. To assemble the ASC device, the CoMnO2-coated and Fe2O3-coated carbon fibers were used as the cathode and the anode materials, respectively. Herein, the nanostructured CoMnO2 were directly deposited onto carbon fibers by a chemical oxidation route without high temperature treatment in presence of ammonium persulfate (APS) as an oxidizing agent. FE-SEM analysis confirmed that the CoMnO2-coated carbon fiber electrode exhibited the porous hierarchical interconnected nanosheet structures, depending on the added amount of APS, and Fe2O3-coated carbon fiber electrode showed a uniform distribution of porous Fe2O3 nanorods over the surface of carbon fibers. The electrochemical properties of the CoMnO2-coated carbon fiber with the concentration of 6 mmol APS presented the enhanced electrochemical activity, probably due to its porous morphologies and good conductivity. Further, to reduce the interfacial contact resistance as well as improve the adhesion between transition metal nanostructures and carbon fibers, the carbon fibers were pre-coated with the Ni layer as a seed layer using an electrochemical deposition method. The fabricated ASC device delivered a specific capacitance of 221 F g-1 at 0.7 A g-1 and good rate capability of 34.8% at 4.9 A g-1. Moreover, the wire-type device displayed the superior energy density of 60.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 490 W kg-1 and excellent capacitance retention of 95% up to 3000 charge/discharge cycles.
33322824/In Vitro Calli Production Resulted in Different Profiles of Plant-Derived Medicinal Compounds in Phyllanthus amarus The efficient production of plant-derived medicinal compounds (PDMCs) from in vitro plants requires improvements in knowledge about control of plant or organ development and factors affecting the biosynthesis pathway of specific PDMCs under in vitro conditions, leading to a realistic large-scale tool for in vitro secondary metabolite production. Thus, this study aimed to develop an in vitro technique, through the induction and proliferation of calli, for production of plant fresh weight, and to compare the PDMC profile obtained from the plants versus in vitro calli of Phyllanthus amarus. It was successfully possible to obtain and proliferate two types of calli, one with a beige color and a friable appearance, obtained in the dark using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium plus 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and a second type with a green color, rigid consistency, and nonfriable appearance obtained under light conditions and MS medium plus 6-benzyladenine (6-BA). In vitro micropropagated plants that gave rise to calli were also acclimatized in a greenhouse and cultivated until obtaining the mass for PDMC analysis and used as a control. While the micropropagated-derived plants concentrated the lignans niranthin, nirtetralin, and phyllanthin, the Phyllanthus amarus calli proliferated in vitro concentrated a completely different biochemical profile and synthesis of compounds, such as betulone, squalene, stigmasterol, and beta-sitosterol, in addition to others not identified by GC-MS database. These results demonstrate the possibility of applying the calli in vitro from Phyllanthus amarus for production of important PDMCs unlike those obtained in cultures of differentiated tissues from field plants.
33322578/A Promising Electrochemical Platform for Dopamine and Uric Acid Detection Based on a Polyaniline/Iron Oxide-Tin Oxide/Reduced Graphene Oxide Ternary Composite A ternary polyaniline/Fe2O3-SnO2/reduced graphene oxide (PFSG) nanocomposite was prepared using a simple two-step hydrothermal treatment. The composite was applied as a glassy carbon electrode modifier (GCE) to enhance dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA) detection. The ternary PFSG composite was compared with its binary precursor Fe2O3-SnO2/reduced graphene oxide (FSG). The influence of the modified GCE electrodes on their performance as a sensing platform was determined. GCE/PFSG showed better sensing parameters than GCE/FSG due to the introduction of polyaniline (PANI), increasing the electrocatalytic properties of the electrode towards the detected analytes. GCE/PFSG enabled the detection of low concentrations of DA (0.076 microM) and UA (1.6 microM). The peak potential separation between DA and UA was very good (180 mV). Moreover, the DA oxidation peak was unaffected even if the concentration of UA was ten times higher. The fabricated sensor showed excellent performance in the simultaneous detection with DA and UA limits of detection: LODDA = 0.15 microM and LODUA = 6.4 microM, and outstanding long-term stability towards DA and UA, holding 100% and 90% of their initial signals respectively, after one month of use.
33322129/Placebo Effect of Caffeine on Maximal Strength and Strength Endurance in Healthy Recreationally Trained Women Habituated to Caffeine Background: By using deceptive experimental designs, several investigations have observed that trained individuals may increase their performance when told they were given caffeine, when in fact they received a placebo (i.e., the placebo effect of caffeine). However, most of these investigations on the placebo effect of caffeine used individuals with low caffeine consumption or did not report habitual caffeine consumption, especially in studies analyzing resistance-based exercise. Hence, it is unknown if habitual caffeine consumers benefit from the placebo effect of caffeine on exercise performance. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the placebo effect of caffeine on maximal strength and strength-endurance performance during the bench press exercise (BP) in women with mild-moderate daily consumption of caffeine. Methods: Thirteen resistance-trained women (BP one-repetition maximum (1RM) = 40.0 +- 9.7 kg) habituated to caffeine (4.1 +- 1.7 mg/kg/day) completed a deceptive randomized experimental design with two experimental trials. On one occasion, participants were told that they would receive 6 mg/kg of caffeine but received a placebo (PLAC), and on other occasions, participants did not receive any substance and were told that this was a control situation (CONT). In each experimental trial, participants underwent a 1RM BP test and a strength-endurance test consisting of performing the maximal number of repetitions at 50% of their 1RM. Results: In comparison to CONT, PLAC did not enhance 1RM (40.0 +- 10.5 kg vs. 41.0 +- 9.5 kg, respectively; p = 0.10), nor did it enhance the number of repetitions (32.2 +- 5.1 vs. 31.8 +- 4.5; p = 0.66) or mean power (130 +- 34 vs. 121 +- 26; p = 0.08) in the strength-endurance test. Conclusion: Informing participants that they were given caffeine, when in fact they received a placebo, did not modify any performance variable measured in this investigation. Thus, the use of the placebo effect of caffeine seemed an ineffective strategy to enhance muscle strength and strength endurance during the BP exercise in women with mild-moderate consumption of caffeine.
33322288/Design, Synthesis and Fungicidal Activity of New 1,2,4-Triazole Derivatives Containing Oxime Ether and Phenoxyl Pyridinyl Moiety A series of novel 1,2,4-triazole derivatives containing oxime ether and phenoxy pyridine moiety were designed and synthesized. The new compounds were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Compound (Z)-1-(6-(4-nitrophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one O-methyl oxime (5a18) was further confirmed by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Their antifungal activities were evaluated against eight phytopathogens. The in vitro bioassays indicated that most of the title compounds displayed moderate to high fungicidal activities. Compound (Z)-1-(6-(4-bromo-2-chlorophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one O-methyl oxime (5a4) exhibited a broad-spectrum antifungal activities with the EC50 values of 1.59, 0.46, 0.27 and 11.39 mg/L against S. sclerotiorum, P. infestans, R. solani and B. cinerea, respectively. Compound (Z)-1-(6-(2-chlorophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one O-benzyl oxime (5b2) provided the lowest EC50 value of 0.12 mg/L against S. sclerotiorum, which were comparable to the commercialized difenoconazole. Moreover, homologous modeling and molecular docking disclosed possible binding modes of compounds 5a4 and 5b2 with CYP51. This work provided useful guidance for the discovery of new 1,2,4-triazole fungicides.
33317120/New Insights for Red Propolis of Alagoas:Chemical Constituents, Topical Membrane Formulations and Their Physicochemical and Biological Properties The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the chemical constitution and allergenic potential of red propolis extract (RPE). They were evaluated, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the release of beta-hexosaminidase, respectively. A plethora of biologically active polyphenols and the absence of allergic responses were evinced. RPE inhibited the release of beta-hexosaminidase, suggesting that the extract does not stimulate allergic responses. Additionally, the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activity of hydrogel membranes loaded with RPE were analyzed. Bio-polymeric hydrogel membranes (M) were obtained using 5% carboxymethylcellulose (M1 and M2), 1.0% of citric acid (M3) and 10% RPE (for all). Their characterization was performed using thermal analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), total phenolic content, phenol release test and, antioxidant activity through 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP). The latter appointed to the similar antioxidant capacity of the M1, M2 and M3. The degradation profiles showed higher thermostability to M3, followed by M2 and M1. The incorporation of RPE into the matrices and the crosslinking of M3 were evinced by FTIR. There were differences in the release of phenolic compounds, with a higher release related to M1 and lower in the strongly crosslinked M3. The degradation profiles showed higher thermostability to M3, followed by M2 and M1. The antibacterial activity of the membranes was determined using the disc diffusion assay, in comparison with controls, obtained in the same way, without RPE. The membranes elicited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with superior performance over M3. The hydrogel membranes loaded with RPE promote a physical barrier against bacterial skin infections and may be applied in the wound healing process.
33317196/Partitioning of Selected Anisole and Veratrole Derivatives between Water and Anionic Surfactant Micelles The UV absorption spectra of six structurally related derivatives of anisole and veratrole, i.e., anisaldehyde, (E)-anethole, estragole, veratraldehyde, methyleugenol and (E)-methylisoeugenol, were recorded at various concentrations of the anionic surfactants, either sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) at T = 298 K. In addition, conductivity and density measurements were made for the SLS and SLES solutions to determine the volumetric properties of the studied surfactants. Next, using the W. Al-Soufi, L. Pineiro and M. Novo model (APN model) including the pseudo-phase model for micellar solubilization, the values of micelle-water partition coefficients for each perfume-surfactant system were determined. In addition, the relations between the molecular structures of the solute and the head group of the surfactant and the value of the micelle-water partition coefficient as well as the octanol-water one were discussed.
33322410/DFT Study on the Mechanism of Iron-Catalyzed Diazocarbonylation The mechanism of the carbonylation of diazomethane in the presence of iron-carbonyl-phosphine catalysts has been investigated by means of DFT calculations at the M06/def-TZVP//B97D3/def2-TZVP level of theory, in combination with the SMD solvation method. The reaction rate is determined by the formation of the coordinatively unsaturated doublet-state Fe(CO)3(P) precursor followed by the diazoalkane coordination and the N2 extrusion. The free energy of activation is predicted to be 18.5 and 28.2 kcal/mol for the PF3 and PPh3 containing systems, respectively. Thus, in the presence of less basic P-donor ligands with stronger -acceptor properties, a significant increase in the reaction rate can be expected. According to energy decomposition analysis combined with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) calculations, diazomethane in the Fe(CO)3(phosphine)(eta1-CH2N2) adduct reveals a -donor--acceptor type of coordination.
33322545/GAG-DB, the New Interface of the Three-Dimensional Landscape of Glycosaminoglycans Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are complex linear polysaccharides. GAG-DB is a curated database that classifies the three-dimensional features of the six mammalian GAGs (chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronan, and keratan sulfate) and their oligosaccharides complexed with proteins. The entries are structures of GAG and GAG-protein complexes determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction methods, X-ray fiber diffractometry, solution NMR spectroscopy, and scattering data often associated with molecular modeling. We designed the database architecture and the navigation tools to query the database with the Protein Data Bank (PDB), UniProtKB, and GlyTouCan (universal glycan repository) identifiers. Special attention was devoted to the description of the bound glycan ligands using simple graphical representation and numerical format for cross-referencing to other databases in glycoscience and functional data. GAG-DB provides detailed information on GAGs, their bound protein ligands, and features their interactions using several open access applications. Binding covers interactions between monosaccharides and protein monosaccharide units and the evaluation of quaternary structure. GAG-DB is freely available.
33322176/Choline Content of Term and Preterm Infant Formulae Compared to Expressed Breast Milk:How Do We Justify the Discrepancies? Choline/phosphatidylcholine concentrations are tightly regulated in all organs and secretions. During rapid organ growth in the third trimester, choline requirement is particularly high. Adequate choline intake is 17-18 mg/kg/day in term infants, whereas ~50-60 mg/kg/day is required to achieve fetal plasma concentrations in preterm infants. Whereas free choline is supplied via the placenta, other choline carriers characterize enteral feeding. We therefore quantified the concentrations and types of choline carriers and choline-related components in various infant formulae and fortifiers compared to breast milk, and calculated the supply at full feeds (150 mL/kg/day) using tandem mass spectrometry. Choline concentration in formula ranged from values below to far above that of breastmilk. Humana 0-VLB (2015: 60.7 mg/150 mL; 2020: 27.3 mg/150 mL), Aptamil-Prematil (2020: 34.7 mg/150 mL), Aptamil-Prematil HA (2020: 37.6 mg/150 mL) for preterm infants with weights < 1800 g, and Humana 0 (2020: 41.6 mg/150 mL) for those > 1800 g, comprised the highest values in formulae studied. Formulae mostly were rich in free choline or phosphatidylcholine rather than glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine (predominating in human milk). Most formulae (150 mL/kg/day) do not supply the amounts and physiologic components of choline required to achieve fetal plasma choline concentrations. A revision of choline content in formulae and breast milk fortifiers and a clear declaration of the choline components in formulae is required to enable informed choices.
33322793/Methiocarb Degradation by Electro-Fenton: Ecotoxicological Evaluation This paper studies the degradation of methiocarb, a highly hazardous pesticide found in waters and wastewaters, through an electro-Fenton process, using a boron-doped diamond anode and a carbon felt cathode; and evaluates its potential to reduce toxicity towards the model organism Daphnia magna. The influence of applied current density and type and concentration of added iron source, Fe2(SO4)3 5H2O or FeCl3 6H2O, is assessed in the degradation experiments of methiocarb aqueous solutions. The experimental results show that electro-Fenton can be successfully used to degrade methiocarb and to reduce its high toxicity towards D. magna. Total methiocarb removal is achieved at the applied electric charge of 90 C, and a 450x reduction in the acute toxicity towards D. magna, on average, from approximately 900 toxic units to 2 toxic units, is observed at the end of the experiments. No significant differences are found between the two iron sources studied. At the lowest applied anodic current density, 12.5 A m-2, an increase in iron concentration led to lower methiocarb removal rates, but the opposite is found at the highest applied current densities. The highest organic carbon removal is obtained at the lowest applied current density and added iron concentration.
33322293/Panax quinquefolius (North American Ginseng) Polysaccharides as Immunomodulators: Current Research Status and Future Directions Panax quinquefolius (North American ginseng, NAG) is a popular medicinal plant used widely in traditional medicine. NAG products are currently available in various forms such as roots, extracts, nutraceuticals, dietary supplements, energy drinks, etc. NAG polysaccharides are recognized as one of the major bioactive ingredients. However, most NAG reviews are focused on ginsenosides with little information on polysaccharides. NAG polysaccharides have demonstrated a therapeutic activity in numerous studies, in which many of the bioactivities involve regulation of the immune response. The purpose of this review is to summarize the structural features and the immunomodulatory properties of crude, partially purified, and pure polysaccharides isolated from NAG. Receptors of the innate immune system that potentially bind to NAG polysaccharides and the respective signal transduction pathways initiated by these compounds are discussed. Major challenges, recent innovations, and future directions in NAG polysaccharide research are also summarized.
33322592/Magnetic Resonance Methods as a Prognostic Tool for the Biorelevant Behavior of Xanthan Tablets Hydrophilic matrix tablets with controlled drug release have been used extensively as one of the most successful oral drug delivery systems for optimizing therapeutic efficacy. In this work, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to study the influence of various pHs and mechanical stresses caused by medium flow (at rest, 80, or 150 mL/min) on swelling and on pentoxifylline release from xanthan (Xan) tablets. Moreover, a bimodal MRI system with simultaneous release testing enables measurements of hydrogel thickness and drug release, both under the same experimental conditions and at the same time. The results show that in water, the hydrogel structure is weaker and less resistant to erosion than the Xan structure in the acid medium. Different hydrogel structures affect drug release with erosion controlled release in water and diffusion controlled release in the acid medium. Mechanical stress simulating gastrointestinal contraction has no effect on the hard hydrogel in the acid medium where the release is independent of the tested stress, while it affects the release from the weak hydrogel in water with faster release under high stress. Our findings suggest that simultaneous MR imaging and drug release from matrix tablets together provide a valuable prognostic tool for prolonged drug delivery design.
33322783/New Multifunctional Agents Based on Conjugates of 4-Amino-2,3-polymethylenequinoline and Butylated Hydroxytoluene for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment New hybrids of 4-amino-2,3-polymethylenequinoline with different sizes of the aliphatic ring linked to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) by enaminoalkyl (7) or aminoalkyl (8) spacers were synthesized as potential multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. All compounds were potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with selectivity toward BChE. Lead compound 8c, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-{[2-(7,8,9,10- tetrahydro-6H-cyclohepta[b]quinolin-11-ylamino)-ethylimino]-methyl}-phenol exhibited an IC50(AChE) = 1.90 +- 0.16 microM, IC50(BChE) = 0.084 +- 0.008 microM, and 13.6 +- 1.2% propidium displacement at 20 muM. Compounds possessed low activity against carboxylesterase, indicating likely absence of clinically unwanted drug-drug interactions. Kinetics were consistent with mixed-type reversible inhibition of both cholinesterases. Docking indicated binding to catalytic and peripheral AChE sites; peripheral site binding along with propidium displacement suggest the potential of the hybrids to block AChE-induced beta-amyloid aggregation, a disease-modifying effect. Compounds demonstrated high antioxidant activity in ABTS and FRAP assays as well as inhibition of luminol chemiluminescence and lipid peroxidation in mouse brain homogenates. Conjugates 8 with amine-containing spacers were better antioxidants than those with enamine spacers 7. Computational ADMET profiles for all compounds predicted good blood-brain barrier distribution (permeability), good intestinal absorption, and medium cardiac toxicity risk. Overall, based on their favorable pharmacological and ADMET profiles, conjugates 8 appear promising as candidates for AD therapeutics.
33322786/Genome Mining Reveals Two Missing CrtP and AldH Enzymes in the C30 Carotenoid Biosynthesis Pathway in Planococcus faecalis AJ003T Planococcus faecalis AJ003T produces glycosyl-4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4'-ol-4-oic acid as its main carotenoid. Five carotenoid pathway genes were presumed to be present in the genome of P. faecalis AJ003T; however, 4,4-diaponeurosporene oxidase (CrtP) was non-functional, and a gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldH) was not identified. In the present study, a genome mining approach identified two missing enzymes, CrtP2 and AldH2454, in the glycosyl-4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4'-ol-4-oic acid biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, CrtP2 and AldH enzymes were functional in heterologous Escherichia coli and generated two carotenoid aldehydes (4,4'-diapolycopene-dial and 4,4'-diaponeurosporene-4-al) and two carotenoid carboxylic acids (4,4'-diaponeurosporenoic acid and 4,4'-diapolycopenoic acid). Furthermore, the genes encoding CrtP2 and AldH2454 were located at a distance the carotenoid gene cluster of P. faecalis.
33316924/A Comparative Study of the Semiconductor Behavior of Organic Thin Films: TCNQ-Doped Cobalt Phthalocyanine and Cobalt Octaethylporphyrin The structure formed by cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and cobalt octaethylporphyrin (CoOEP) with electron-acceptor tetracyano-pi-quinodimethane (TCNQ), was studied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. According to theoretical calculations, both cobalt systems can establish dispersion forces related to TCNQ and also in both cases the link between them is built by means of hydrogen bonds. Based on the results of these DFT calculations, we developed experimental work: the organic semiconductors were doped, and the thermal evaporation technique was used to prepare semiconductor thin films of such compounds. The structure of the films was studied by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The optical properties of the CoPc-TCNQ and CoOEP-TCNQ films were investigated by means of UV-Vis measurements. The results obtained were used to estimate the type of transitions and the optical bandgap. The results were compared to the previously calculated theoretical bandgap. The CoOEP-TCNQ film presented the smallest theoretical and experimental bandgap. Finally, the electrical properties of the organic semiconductors were evaluated from a PET (polyethylene terephthalate)/indium tin oxide (ITO)/cobalt macrocycle-TCNQ/silver (Ag) device we prepared. The CoOEP-TCNQ-based device showed an ohmic behavior. The device manufactured from CoPc-TCNQ also showed an ohmic behavior at low voltages, but significantly changed to SCLC (space-charge limited conductivity) at high voltage values.
33322262/Effect of Oligosaccharide Degree of Polymerization on the Induction of Xylan-Degrading Enzymes by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Lycopersici Xylan is one of the most abundant carbohydrates on Earth. Complete degradation of xylan is achieved by the collaborative action of endo-beta-1,4-xylanases and beta-d-xylosidases and a number of accessories enzymes. In filamentous fungi, the xylanolytic system is controlled through induction and repression. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Substrates containing xylan promote the induction of xylanases, which release xylooligosaccharides. These, in turn, induce expression of xylanase-encoding genes. Here, we aimed to determine which xylan degradation products acted as inducers, and whether the size of the released oligomer correlated with its induction strength. To this end, we compared xylanase production by different inducers, such as sophorose, lactose, cellooligosaccharides, and xylooligosaccharides in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Results indicate that xylooligosaccharides are more effective than other substrates at inducing endoxylanase and beta-xylosidases. Moreover, we report a correlation between the degree of xylooligosaccharide polymerization and induction efficiency of each enzyme. Specifically, xylotetraose is the best inducer of endoxylanase, xylohexaose of extracellular beta-xylosidase, and xylobiose of cell-bound beta-xylosidase.
33322778/Misincorporation of Galactose by Chondroitin Synthase of Escherichia coli K4: From Traces to Synthesis of Chondbiuronan, a Novel Chondroitin-Like Polysaccharide Chondroitin synthase KfoC is a bifunctional enzyme which polymerizes the capsular chondroitin backbone of Escherichia coli K4, composed of repeated beta3N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-beta4-glucuronic acid (GlcA) units. Sugar donors UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA are the natural precursors of bacterial chondroitin synthesis. We have expressed KfoC in a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli deprived of 4-epimerase activity, thus incapable of supplying UDP-GalNAc in the bacterial cytoplasm. The strain was also co-expressing mammal galactose beta-glucuronyltransferase, providing glucuronyl-lactose from exogenously added lactose, serving as a primer of polymerization. We show by the mean of NMR analyses that in those conditions, KfoC incorporates galactose, forming a chondroitin-like polymer composed of the repeated beta3-galactose (Gal)-beta4-glucuronic acid units. We also show that when UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase KfoA, encoded by the K4-operon, was co-expressed and produced UDP-GalNAc, a small proportion of galactose was still incorporated into the growing chain of chondroitin.
33316963/The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond Type on the Gas-Phase Deprotonation of ortho-Substituted Benzenesulfonic Acids. A Density Functional Theory Study Structural factors have been identified that determine the gas-phase acidity of ortho-substituted benzenesulfonic acid, 2-XC6H4-SO3H, (X = -SO3H, -COOH, -NO2, -SO2F, -C N, -NH2, -CH3, -OCH3, -N(CH3)2, -OH). The DFT/B3LYP/cc-pVTZ method was used to perform conformational analysis and study the structural features of the molecular and deprotonated forms of these compounds. It has been shown that many of the conformers may contain anintramolecular hydrogen bond (IHB) between the sulfonic group and the substituent, and the sulfonic group can be an IHB donor or an acceptor. The Gibbs energies of gas-phase deprotonation DeltarG0298 (kJ mol-1) were calculated for all compounds. It has been set that in ortho-substituted benzenesulfonic acids, the formation of various types of IHB is possible, having a significant effect on the DeltarG0298 values of gas-phase deprotonation. If the -SO3H group is the IHB donor, then an ion without an IHB is formed upon deprotonation, and the deprotonation energy increases. If this group is an IHB acceptor, then a significant decrease in DeltarG0298 of gas-phase deprotonation is observed due to an increase in IHB strength and the A- anion additional stabilization. A proton donor ability comparative characteristic of the -SO3H group in the studied ortho-substituted benzenesulfonic acids is given, and the DeltarG0298 energies are compared with the corresponding values of ortho-substituted benzoic acids.
33322600/Improving Vesicular Integrity and Antioxidant Activity of Novel Mixed Soy Lecithin-Based Liposomes Containing Squalene and Their Stability against UV Light In order to improve the membrane lipophilicity and the affinity towards the environment of lipid bilayers, squalene (SQ) could be conjugated to phospholipids in the formation of liposomes. The effect of membrane composition and concentrations on the degradation of liposomes prepared via the extrusion method was investigated. Liposomes were prepared using a mixture of SQ, cholesterol (CH) and Tween80 (TW80). Based on the optimal conditions, liposome batches were prepared in the absence and presence of SQ. Their physicochemical and stability behavior were evaluated as a function of liposome constituent. From the optimization study, the liposomal formulation containing 5% (w/w) mixed soy lecithin (ML), 0.5% (w/w) SQ, 0.3% (w/w) CH and 0.75% (w/w) TW80 had optimal physicochemical properties and displayed a unilamellar structure. Liposome prepared using the optimal formulation had a low particle size (158.31 +- 2.96 nm) and acceptable %increase in the particle size (15.09% +- 3.76%) and %trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (%TEAC) loss (35.69% +- 0.72%) against UV light treatment (280-320 nm) for 6 h. The interesting outcome of this research was the association of naturally occurring substance SQ for size reduction without the extra input of energy or mechanical procedures, and improvement of vesicle stability and antioxidant activity of ML-based liposome. This study also demonstrated that the presence of SQ in the membrane might increase the acyl chain dynamics and decrease the viscosity of the dispersion, thereby limiting long-term stability of the liposome.
33322706/Low Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels Are Related to Frailty and Sarcopenia in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease Low vitamin D status is related to frailty and/or sarcopenia in elderly individuals. However, these relationships are unclear in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). This study aimed at exploring the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and frailty or sarcopenia in 231 patients with CLD. Frailty was determined based on five factors (weight loss, low physical activity, weakness, slowness, and exhaustion). Sarcopenia was diagnosed by applying the Japan Society of Hepatology criteria. The patients were classified into three groups according to baseline 25(OH)D levels: low (L), intermediate (I), and high (H) vitamin D (VD) groups. Of the 231 patients, 70 (30.3%) and 66 (28.6%) had frailty and sarcopenia, respectively. The prevalence rate of frailty and sarcopenia significantly increased stepwise with a decline in the vitamin D status. The L-VD group showed the highest prevalence rates of frailty and sarcopenia (49.1% (28/57), p < 0.001 for both), whereas the H-VD group showed the lowest prevalence rates of frailty (15.3% (9/59)) and sarcopenia (18.6% (11/59)) (p < 0.001 for both). Multivariate analysis identified serum 25(OH)D levels as a significant independent factor related to frailty and sarcopenia. Serum 25(OH)D levels significantly correlated with handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass index, and gait speed. In conclusion, low serum vitamin D level, especially severe vitamin D deficient status, is closely related to frailty and sarcopenia in patients with CLD.
33316898/Sensitive Analysis of Idarubicin in Human Urine and Plasma by Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection: An Application in Drug Monitoring A new approach for the sensitive, robust and rapid determination of idarubicin (IDA) in human plasma and urine samples based on liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FL) was developed. Satisfactory chromatographic separation of the analyte after solid-phase extraction (SPE) was performed on a Discovery HS C18 analytical column using a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as the mobile phase in isocratic mode. IDA and daunorubicin hydrochloride used as an internal standard (I.S.) were monitored at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 487 and 547 nm, respectively. The method was validated according to the FDA and ICH guidelines. The linearity was confirmed in the range of 0.1-50 ng/mL and 0.25-200 ng/mL, while the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.05 and 0.125 ng/mL in plasma and urine samples, respectively. The developed LC-FL method was successfully applied for drug determinations in human plasma and urine after oral administration of IDA at a dose of 10 mg to a patient with highly advanced alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMA). Moreover, the potential exposure to IDA present in both fluids for healthcare workers and the caregivers of patients has been evaluated. The present LC-FL method can be a useful tool in pharmacokinetic and clinical investigations, in the monitoring of chemotherapy containing IDA, as well as for sensitive and reliable IDA quantitation in biological fluids.
33322588/Determination of Neonicotinoid Pesticides in Propolis with Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry In this study, a method was developed for the determination of five neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in propolis. Two sample preparation methods were tested: solid-phase extraction and the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. The identities of analytes were confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring mode. Solid-phase extraction resulted in cleaner extracts; therefore, the SPE-LC-MS/MS method was validated according to the SANTE protocol in triplicate at two spiking levels (10 ng/g and 50 ng/g). The average recoveries of analytes ranged from 61% to 101%, except for clothianidin (10-20%). The LOD ranged from 0.2 ng/g to 4.4 ng/g, whereas the LOQ was in the range of 0.8 ng/g-14.7 ng/g. In order to compensate for the matrix effect, matrix-matched calibration was used. Good accuracy (relative error: 1.9-10.4%) and good linearity (R2 > 0.991) were obtained for all compounds. The optimised method was applied to 30 samples: 18 raw propolis and 12 ethanol tinctures. Acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid were detectable in seven samples but were still below the LOQ. This study is the first to report the determination of several neonicotinoid residues in propolis.
33327368/Secoiridoid Glucosides and Anti-Inflammatory Constituents from the Stem Bark of Fraxinus chinensis Qin Pi (Fraxinus chinensis Roxb.) is commercially used in healthcare products for the improvement of intestinal function and gouty arthritis in many countries. Three new secoiridoid glucosides, (8E)-4''-O-methylligstroside (1), (8E)-4''-O-methyldemethylligstroside (2), and 3'',4''-di-O-methyl-demethyloleuropein (3), have been isolated from the stem bark of Fraxinus chinensis, together with 23 known compounds (4-26). The structures of the new compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses (1D, 2D NMR, IR, UV, and HRESIMS). Among the isolated compounds, (8E)-4''-O-methylligstroside (1), (8E)-4''-O-methyldemethylligstroside (2), 3'',4''-di-O-methyldemethyloleuropein (3), oleuropein (6), aesculetin (9), isoscopoletin (11), aesculetin dimethyl ester (12), fraxetin (14), tyrosol (21), 4-hydroxyphenethyl acetate (22), and (+)-pinoresinol (24) exhibited inhibition (IC50 <= 7.65 mug/mL) of superoxide anion generation by human neutrophils in response to formyl-L-methionyl-L-leuckyl-L-phenylalanine/cytochalasin B (fMLP/CB). Compounds 1, 9, 11, 14, 21, and 22 inhibited fMLP/CB-induced elastase release with IC50 <= 3.23 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 2, 9, 11, 14, and 21 showed potent inhibition with IC50 values <= 27.11 muM, against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) generation. The well-known proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), were also inhibited by compounds 1, 9, and 14. Compounds 1, 9, and 14 displayed an anti-inflammatory effect against NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 through the inhibition of activation of MAPKs and IkappaBalpha in LPS-activated macrophages. In addition, compounds 1, 9, and 14 stimulated anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype by elevating the expression of arginase 1 and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). The above results suggested that compounds 1, 9, and 14 could be considered as potential compounds for further development of NO production-targeted anti-inflammatory agents.
33322719/The Influence of Physical Activity on the Bioactive Lipids Metabolism in Obesity-Induced Muscle Insulin Resistance High-fat diet consumption and lack of physical activity are important risk factors for metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a state of a weakened response of tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver to insulin, which causes an increase in blood glucose levels. This condition is the result of inhibition of the intracellular insulin signaling pathway. Skeletal muscle is an important insulin-sensitive tissue that accounts for about 80% of insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Although the exact mechanism by which insulin resistance is induced has not been thoroughly understood, it is known that insulin resistance is most commonly associated with obesity. Therefore, it is believed that lipids may play an important role in inducing insulin resistance. Among lipids, researchers' attention is mainly focused on biologically active lipids: diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramides. These lipids are able to regulate the activity of intracellular enzymes, including those involved in insulin signaling. Available data indicate that physical activity affects lipid metabolism and has a positive effect on insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles. In this review, we have presented the current state of knowledge about the impact of physical activity on insulin resistance and metabolism of biologically active lipids.
33322827/Synthetic Methods of Phosphonopeptides Phosphonopeptides are phosphorus analogues of peptides and have been widely applied as enzyme inhibitors and antigens to induce catalytic antibodies. Phosphonopeptides generally contain one aminoalkylphosphonic acid residue and include phosphonopeptides with C-terminal aminoalkylphosphonic acids and phosphonopeptides with a phosphonamidate bond. The phosphonamidate bond in the phosphonopeptides is generally formed via phosphonylation with phosphonochloridates, condensation with coupling reagents and enzymes, and phosphinylation followed by oxidation. Pseudo four-component condensation reaction of amides, aldehydes, alkyl dichlorophosphites, and amino/peptide esters is an alternative, convergent, and efficient strategy for synthesis of phosphonopeptides through simultaneous construction of aminoalkylphosphonic acids and formation of the phosphonamidate bond. This review focuses on the synthetic methods of phosphonopeptides containing a phosphonamidate bond.
33322282/Development and Characterization of an Orodispersible Film for Vitamin D3 Supplementation Vitamin D plays a crucial and very well-known role in regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and mineralization. However, a huge and more recent body of evidence supports the positive influence of vitamin D on the regulation of immune response, ranging from protection against respiratory tract infections to prevention and management of asthma. Nevertheless, vitamin D deficiency is a very common condition and there is an increasing need for suitable products for proper supplementation, allowing good compliance also in specific populations. Orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) were first developed to overcome the difficulty experienced by pediatric and geriatric patients of swallowing traditional oral dosage forms and, recently, orodispersible films (ODF) are gaining popularity as novel dosage form for assuming active pharmaceutical ingredients, vitamins, and ingredients for food supplements. This study describes a 2000 IU Vitamin D3 ODF for daily intake, consisting of hydrophilic polymers and suitable excipients, manufactured by film-casting process. Elongation-at-break (E%), Young's modulus (Y), and tensile strength (TS) were investigated using a dynamometer. Chemical stability was evaluated assaying the vitamin D3 in the films stored at different environmental conditions. In addition, in vitro disintegration and dissolution studies were performed. Correlation existed between the mechanical properties of the film and the residual water, acting as plasticizer. The stability study showed that vitamin D3 assay was >=90% also after 3 months at 40  C. The film disintegrated in less than 1 min and the vitamin D3 released was >=75% after 15 min. An ODF with suitable properties can be manufactured and used as innovative dosage form for vitamin D3 food supplements.
33322752/Styrylpyrazoles: Properties, Synthesis and Transformations The pyrazole nucleus and its reduced forms, pyrazolines and pyrazolidine, are privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry due to their remarkable biological activities. A huge number of pyrazole derivatives have been studied and reported over time. This review article gives an overview of pyrazole derivatives that contain a styryl (2-arylvinyl) group linked in different positions of the pyrazole backbone. Although there are studies on the synthesis of styrylpyrazoles dating back to the 1970s and even earlier, this type of compound has rarely been studied. This timely review intends to summarize the properties, biological activity, methods of synthesis and transformation of styrylpyrazoles; thus, highlighting the interest and huge potential for application of this kind of compound.
33317096/Investigation of the Phytochemical Composition, Antioxidant Activity, and Methylglyoxal Trapping Effect of Galega officinalis L. Herb In Vitro Galega officinalis L. has been known for centuries as an herbal medicine used to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes, but its comprehensive chemical composition and pharmacological activity are still insufficiently known. The current study involved the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis and in vitro evaluation of the antioxidative and methylglyoxal (MGO) trapping properties of galega herb. Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with both the electrospray ionization mass spectrometer and diode-array detector (UHPLC-ESI-MS and UHPLC-DAD) were used to investigate the composition and evaluate the anti-MGO capability of extracts and their components. Hot water and aqueous methanol extracts, as well as individual compounds representing phytochemical groups, were also assessed for antioxidant activity using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. Quercetin and metformin were used as a positive control. We confirmed the presence of tricyclic quinazoline alkaloids, guanidines, flavonoids, and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) in galega extracts. The polyphenolic fraction was dominated by mono-, di-, and triglycosylated flavonols, as well as monocaffeoylhexaric acids. The in vitro tests indicated which G. officinalis components exhibit beneficial antioxidative and MGO trapping effects. For galega extracts, flavonols, and HCAs, a potent antiradical activity was observed. The ability to trap MGO was noted for guanidines and flavonoids, whereas HCA esters and quinazoline alkaloids were ineffective. The formation of mono-MGO adducts of galegine, hydroxygalegine, and rutin in the examined water infusion was observed.
33322199/Selenium Nutritional Status of Rural Residents and its Correlation with Dietary Intake Patterns in a Typical Low-Selenium Area in China China is recognized as a selenium-deficient country, and nutritional selenium intake has always been a concern. To clarify the current inhabitants' selenium nutrition status and the characteristics of dietary consumption in low-selenium areas, samples of human hair and grains were collected, and food frequency questionnaires were administered in Binxian County, Shaanxi Province, a typical low-selenium area in the Loess Plateau. The subject number of the study is 85, and the age range is from 11 to 81 years, with an average of 60. The results showed that the average hair selenium content of the residents was 231.7 mug/kg, and 62.4% of the participants had levels higher than the selenium deficiency threshold (200 mug/kg). There was a significant positive correlation between the hair selenium content and the food consumption score after adjusting for rice outsourcing. Three different dietary patterns were noted according to hierarchical cluster analysis. This study provides a tool for assessing the selenium nutrition of inhabitants in low-selenium areas and has considerable significance for improving the dietary pattern of residents.
33322734/Risk of Mercury Ingestion from Canned Fish in Poland In this study, total mercury content was determined in 84 canned fish corresponding to commonly consumed brands (over 14 different producers), which were purchased from local markets in Poland in the years 2019-2020. For comparison purposes, samples of both the matrix in which the fish were kept along with the seafood samples were measured. The analyses were carried out using the cold vapor AAS technique. Statistical analyses were employed to identify significant differences in mercury content in relation to the selected criteria such as fish species, type of fish (predatory, non-predatory) and the producer brand. The obtained results were compared against domestic and international standards as well as with the literature data in order to evaluate the safety of the canned fish consumption. The study revealed that none of canned fish exceeded the acceptable levels set by the FAO/WHO. The highest amount of Hg was recorded for canned tuna (maximum 351.30 microg/kg, mean 74.38 microg/kg). Further, the estimated tolerable dose of weekly mercury intake suggests that the consumption of over 1.8 cans of fish with the highest mean mercury content should not pose a risk to consumers in Poland according to international standards. Among the ten highest mean results for mercury, five of them belonged to canned tuna (Bonito species) kept in different matrices. These consisted of seven domestic and three imported brands of fish products, which is a worrying message for a local community. Mercury content in predatory fish differed significantly from the results gathered for non-predatory fish and the total amount of mercury in studied canned fish corresponded to their status in the aquatic food chain. Moreover, significant differences were stated between various fish species and fishing areas. Fish caught in the Atlantic Ocean (cod and herring) presented higher mercury content than the ones from closed seas.
33322361/Simulating Absorption Spectra of Flavonoids in Aqueous Solution: A Polarizable QM/MM Study We present a detailed computational study of the UV/Vis spectra of four relevant flavonoids in aqueous solution, namely luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. The absorption spectra are simulated by exploiting a fully polarizable quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) model, based on the fluctuating charge (FQ) force field. Such a model is coupled with configurational sampling obtained by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The calculated QM/FQ spectra are compared with the experiments. We show that an accurate reproduction of the UV/Vis spectra of the selected flavonoids can be obtained by appropriately taking into account the role of configurational sampling, polarization, and hydrogen bonding interactions.
33317156/Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation Improves Renal Function in Elderly Deficient in Selenium: Observational Results and Results from a Subgroup Analysis of a Prospective Randomised Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial A low selenium intake is found in European countries, and is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. There is an association between selenium level and the severity of kidney disease. An association between inflammation and selenium intake is also reported. The coenzyme Q10 level is decreased in kidney disease. The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between selenium and renal function in an elderly population low in selenium and coenzyme Q10, and the impact of intervention with selenium and coenzyme Q10 on the renal function. The association between selenium status and creatinine was studied in 589 elderly persons. In 215 of these (mean age 71 years) a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled prospective trial with selenium yeast (200 microg/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) (n = 117) or placebo (n = 98) was conducted. Renal function was determined using measures of glomerular function at the start and after 48 months. The follow-up time was 5.1 years. All individuals were low on selenium (mean 67 mug/L (SD 16.8)). The changes in renal function were evaluated by measurement of creatinine, cystatin-C, and the use of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) algorithm, and by the use of T-tests, repeated measures of variance and ANCOVA analyses. An association between low selenium status and impaired renal function was observed. Intervention causes a significantly lower serum creatinine, and cystatin-C concentration in the active treatment group compared with those on placebo (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.001 resp.). The evaluation with CKD-EPI based on both creatinine and cystatin-C showed a corresponding significant difference (p < 0.0001). All validations showed corresponding significant differences. In individuals with a deficiency of selenium and coenzyme Q10, low selenium status is related to impaired renal function, and thus supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 results in significantly improved renal function as seen from creatinine and cystatin-C and through the CKD-EPI algorithm. The explanation could be related to positive effects on inflammation and oxidative stress as a result of the supplementation.
33322431/Flavonol Glycosides: In Vitro Inhibition of DPPIV, Aldose Reductase and Combating Oxidative Stress are Potential Mechanisms for Mediating the Antidiabetic Activity of Cleome droserifolia Diabetes is a major health problem that is associated with high risk of various complications. Medicinal plants hold great promise against diabetes. The traditional use of Cleome droserifolia as an antidiabetic agent was correlated to its flavonol glycosides content. In the current study, five major flavonol glycosides appeared on the RP-HPLC chromatogram of the aqueous extract namely; quercetin-3-O-beta-d-glucosyl-7-O-alpha-rhamnoside (1), isorhamnetin-7-O-beta-neohesperidoside (2), isorhamnetin-3-O-beta-d-glucoside (3) kaempferol-4'-methoxy-3,7-O-alpha-dirhamnoside (4), and isorhamnetin-3-O-alpha-(4''-acetylrhamnoside)-7-O-alpha-rhamnoside (5). The inhibitory activities of these compounds were tested in vitro against several enzymes involved in diabetes management. Only the relatively less polar methoxylated flavonol glycosides (4, 5) showed mild to moderate alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Compounds 1-4 displayed remarkable inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme (IC50 0.194 +- 0.06, 0.573 +- 0.03, 0.345 +- 0.02 and 0.281 +- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively) comparable to vildagliptin (IC50 0.154 +- 0.02 microg/mL). Moreover, these compounds showed high potential in preventing diabetes complications through inhibiting aldose reductase enzyme and combating oxidative stress. Both isorhamnetin glycoside derivatives (2, 3) exhibited the highest activities in aldose reductase inhibition and compound 2 (IC50 5.45 +- 0.26 microg/mL) was even more potent than standard quercetin (IC50 7.77 +- 0.43 microg/mL). Additionally, these flavonols exerted excellent antioxidant capacities through 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant (FRAP) assays. 
33327463/Structural Insight into the Contributions of the N-Terminus and Key Active-Site Residues to the Catalytic Efficiency of Glutamine Synthetase 2 Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes the condensation of ammonia and glutamate, along with ATP, to form glutamine. Despite extensive studies on GSs from eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the roles of the N-terminus and other structural features in catalysis remain unclear. Here we report the decameric structure of Drosophila melanogaster GS 2 (DmGS2). The N-terminal short helices, alpha1 and alpha2, constitute a meander region, and form hydrogen bonds with residues 3-5 in the N-terminal loop, which are not present in the GSs of other species. Deletion of alpha1 or alpha1-alpha2 inactivates DmGS2. Notably, the Arg4 in each monomer of one pentamer forms hydrogen bonds with Glu7, and Asp8 in the adjacent monomer of the other pentamer. Replacement of Arg4 with Asp (R4D) abolishes activity. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that Arg4 is crucial for oligomerization. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that R4D may alter the secondary structure. We mutated key residues to identify the substrate-binding site. As Glu140 binds glutamate and Glu311 binds ammonia, mutants E140A and E311A have little activity. Conversely, mutant P214A (P contributes to ATP binding) has higher activity than wild-type DmGS2. These findings expand the understanding of the structural and functional features of the N-terminal meander region of DmGS2 and the residues important for catalytic efficiency.
33327436/The Cholinesterase Inhibitory Properties of Stephaniae Tetrandrae Radix Stephaniae tetrandrae radix (STR) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine in alleviating edema by inducing diuresis. In the clinic, STR extracts or its components are widely used in the treatment of edema, dysuria, and rheumatism for the regulation of water metabolism. Furthermore, STR has been used in treating emotional problems for years by combining with other Chinese herbs. However, the material basis and mechanism of STR on the nervous system have not been revealed. Here, the main components of STR extracts with different extracting solvents were identified, including three major alkaloids, i.e., cyclanoline, fangchinoline, and tetrandrine. The cholinesterase inhibitory activity of STR extracts and its alkaloids was determined using the Ellman assay. Both cyclanoline and fangchinoline showed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, demonstrating noncompetitive enzyme inhibition. In contrast, tetrandrine did not show enzymatic inhibition. The synergism of STR alkaloids with huperzine A or donepezil was calculated by the median-effect principle. The drug combination of fangchinoline-huperzine A or donepezil synergistically inhibited AChE, having a combination index (CI) < 1 at Fa = 0.5. Furthermore, the molecular docking results showed that fangchinoline bound with AChE residues in the peripheral anionic site, and cyclanoline bound with AChE residues in the peripheral anionic site, anionic site, and catalytic site. In parallel, cyclanoline bound with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) residues in the anionic site, catalytic site, and aromatic site. The results support that fangchinoline and cyclanoline, alkaloids derived from STR, could account for the anti-AChE function of STR. Thus, STR extract or its alkaloids may potentially be developed as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's patients.
33327504/Tetrabutylammonium Bromide (TBAB) Catalyzed Synthesis of Bioactive Heterocycles During the last two decades, tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) has gained significant attention as an efficient metal-free homogeneous phase-transfer catalyst. A catalytic amount of TBAB is sufficient to catalyze various alkylation, oxidation, reduction, and esterification processes. It is also employed as an efficient co-catalyst for numerous coupling reactions. It has also acted as an efficient zwitterionic solvent in many organic transformations under molten conditions. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments on TBAB-catalyzed protocols for the efficient synthesis of various biologically promising heterocyclic scaffolds.
33327547/Effects of Chemically-Modified Polypyridyl Ligands on the Structural and Redox Properties of Tricarbonylmanganese(I) Complexes Carbonyl complexes with manganese(I) as the central metal are very attractive catalysts. The introduction of redox-active ligands, such as quinones and methyl viologen analogs into these catalysts, would be expected to lead to superior catalyst performances, since they can function as excellent electron carriers. In this study, we synthesized four tricarbonylmanganese(I) complexes containing typical bidentate polypyridyl ligands, including 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) frameworks bound to redox-active ortho-quinone/catechol or methyl viologen-like units. The molecular structures of the resulting complexes were determined by X-ray crystallography to clarify their steric features. As expected from the infrared (IR) data, three CO ligands for each complex were coordinated in the facial configuration around the central manganese(I) atom. Additionally, the structural parameters were found to differ significantly between the quinone/catechol units. Electrochemical analysis revealed some differences between them and their reference complexes, namely [MnBr(CO)3(phen)] and [MnBr(CO)3(bpy)]. Notably, interconversions induced by two-electron/two-proton transfers between the quinone and catechol units were observed in the phenanthroline-based complexes. This work indicated that the structural and redox properties in tricarbonylmanganese(I) complexes were significantly affected by chemically modified polypyridyl ligands. A better understanding of structures and redox behaviors of the present compounds would facilitate the design of new manganese complexes with enhanced properties.
33327541/Effect of the Content and Ordering of the sp2 Free Carbon Phase on the Charge Carrier Transport in Polymer-Derived Silicon Oxycarbides The present work elaborates on the correlation between the amount and ordering of the free carbon phase in silicon oxycarbides and their charge carrier transport behavior. Thus, silicon oxycarbides possessing free carbon contents from 0 to ca. 58 vol.% (SiOC/C) were synthesized and exposed to temperatures from 1100 to 1800  C. The prepared samples were extensively analyzed concerning the thermal evolution of the sp2 carbon phase by means of Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, electrical conductivity and Hall measurements were performed and correlated with the structural information obtained from the Raman spectroscopic investigation. It is shown that the percolation threshold in SiOC/C samples depends on the temperature of their thermal treatment, varying from ca. 20 vol.% in the samples prepared at 1100  C to ca. 6 vol.% for the samples annealed at 1600  C. Moreover, three different conduction regimes are identified in SiOC/C, depending on its sp2 carbon content: (i) at low carbon contents (i.e., <1 vol.%), the silicon oxycarbide glassy matrix dominates the charge carrier transport, which exhibits an activation energy of ca. 1 eV and occurs within localized states, presumably dangling bonds; (ii) near the percolation threshold, tunneling or hopping of charge carriers between spatially separated sp2 carbon precipitates appear to be responsible for the electrical conductivity; (iii) whereas above the percolation threshold, the charge carrier transport is only weakly activated (Ea = 0.03 eV) and is realized through the (continuous) carbon phase. Hall measurements on SiOC/C samples above the percolation threshold indicate p-type carriers mainly contributing to conduction. Their density is shown to vary with the sp2 carbon content in the range from 1014 to 1019 cm-3; whereas their mobility (ca. 3 cm2/V) seems to not depend on the sp2 carbon content.
33327589/Generation of Bis(ferrocenyl)silylenes from Siliranes   Divalent silicon species, the so-called silylenes, represent attractive organosilicon building blocks. Isolable stable silylenes remain scarce, and in most hitherto reported examples, the silicon center is stabilized by electron-donating substituents (e.g., heteroatoms such as nitrogen), which results in electronic perturbation. In order to avoid such electronic perturbation, we have been interested in the chemistry of reactive silylenes with carbon-based substituents such as ferrocenyl groups. Due to the presence of a divalent silicon center and the redox-active transition metal iron, ferrocenylsilylenes can be expected to exhibit interesting redox behavior. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a bis(ferrocenyl)silirane as a precursor for a bis(ferrocenyl)silylene, which could potentially be used as a building block for redox-active organosilicon compounds. It was found that the isolated bis(ferrocenyl)siliranes could be a bottleable precursor for the bis(ferrocenyl)silylene under mild conditions.
33327642/Host-Guest Complexation of Oxaliplatin and Para-Sulfonatocalix[n]Arenes for Potential Use in Cancer Therapy P-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes have demonstrated a great potential for encapsulation of therapeutic drugs via host-guest complexation to improve solubility, stability, and bioavailability of encapsulated drugs. In this work, guest-host complexes of a third-generation anticancer drug (oxaliplatin) and p-4-sulfocalix[n]arenes (n = 4 and 6; p-SC4 and p-SC6, respectively) were prepared and investigated, using 1H NMR, UV, Job's plot analysis, and DFT calculations, for use as cancer therapeutics. The peak amplitude of the prepared host-guest complexes was linearly proportional to the concentration of oxaliplatin in the range of 1.0 x 10-5 M-1 to 2.1 x 10-4 M-1. The reaction stoichiometry between either p-SC4 or p-SC6 and oxaliplatin in the formed complexes was 1:1. The stability constants for the complexes were 5.07 x 104 M-1 and 6.3 x 104 M-1. These correspond to complexation free energy of -6.39 and -6.52 kcal/mol for p-SC4 and p-SC6, respectively. Complexation between oxaliplatin and p-SC4 or p-SC6 was found to involve hydrogen bonds. Both complexes exhibited enhanced biological and high cytotoxic activities against HT-29 colorectal cells and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma compared to free oxaliplatin, which warrants further investigation for cancer therapy.
33327655/Stereoselective Synthesis of Multisubstituted Cyclohexanes by Reaction of Conjugated Enynones with Malononitrile in the Presence of LDA Reaction of linear conjugated enynones, 1,5-diarylpent-2-en-4-yn-1-ones, with malononitrile in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide LDA, as a base, in THF at room temperature for 3-7 h resulted in the formation of the product of dimerization, multisubstituted polyfunctional cyclohexanes, 4-aryl-2,6-bis(arylethynyl)-3-(aryloxomethyl)-4-hydroxycyclohexane-1,1-dicarbonitriles, in yields up to 60%. Varying the reaction conditions by decreasing time and temperature and changing the ratio of starting compounds (enynone and malononitrile) allowed isolating some intermediate compounds, which confirmed a plausible reaction mechanism. The relative stability of possible stereoisomers of such cyclohexanes was estimated by quantum chemical calculations (DFT method). The obtained cyclohexanes were found to possess photoluminescent properties.
33333775/Inositol Hexaphosphate (IP6) and Colon Cancer: From Concepts and First Experiments to Clinical Application Multiple human health-beneficial effects have been related to highly phosphorylated inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). This naturally occurring carbohydrate and its parent compound, myo-inositol (Ins), are abundantly present in plants, particularly in certain high-fiber diets, but also in mammalian cells, where they regulate important cellular functions. However, the striking and broad-spectrum anticancer activity of IP6, consistently demonstrated in different experimental models, has been in a spotlight of the scientific community dealing with the nutrition and cancer during the last several decades. First experiments were performed in colon cancer 30 years ago. Since then, it has been shown that IP6 reduces cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and differentiation of malignant cells with reversion to normal phenotype, affecting several critical molecular targets. Enhanced immunity and antioxidant properties also contribute to the tumor cell destruction. Although Ins possesses a modest anticancer potential, the best anticancer results were obtained from the combination of IP6 + Ins. Here we review the first experimental steps in colon cancer, when concepts and hypotheses were put together almost without real knowledge and present clinical studies, that were initiated in colon cancer patients. Available as a dietary supplement, IP6 + Ins has been shown to enhance the anticancer effect of conventional chemotherapy, controls cancer metastases, and improves quality of life in cancer patients. Emerging clinical and still vast amount of experimental data suggest its role either as an adjuvant or as an "alternative" to current chemotherapy for cancer.
33333751/Stacking Effects on Anthraquinone/DNA Charge-Transfer Electronically Excited States The design of more efficient photosensitizers is a matter of great importance in the field of cancer treatment by means of photodynamic therapy. One of the main processes involved in the activation of apoptosis in cancer cells is the oxidative stress on DNA once a photosensitizer is excited by light. As a consequence, it is very relevant to investigate in detail the binding modes of the chromophore with DNA, and the nature of the electronically excited states that participate in the induction of DNA damage, for example, charge-transfer states. In this work, we investigate the electronic structure of the anthraquinone photosensitizer intercalated into a double-stranded poly(dG-dC) decamer model of DNA. First, the different geometric configurations are analyzed by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. Then, the excited states for the most relevant poses of anthraquinone inside the binding pocket are computed by an electrostatic-embedding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach, where anthraquinone and one of the nearby guanine residues are described quantum mechanically to take into account intermolecular charge-transfer states. The excited states are characterized as monomer, exciton, excimer, and charge-transfer states based on the analysis of the transition density matrix, and each of these contributions to the total density of states and absorption spectrum is discussed in terms of the stacking interactions. These results are relevant as they represent the footing for future studies on the reactivity of anthraquinone derivatives with DNA and give insights on possible geometrical configurations that potentially favor the oxidative stress of DNA.
33333745/Biotechnological Approaches on Two High CBD and CBG Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae) Varieties: In Vitro Regeneration and Phytochemical Consistency Evaluation of Micropropagated Plants Using Quantitative 1H-NMR High cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) varieties of Cannabis sativa L., a species with medicinal properties, were regenerated in vitro. Explants of nodal segments including healthy axillary bud, after sterilization, were placed in Murashige-Skoog (MS) culture medium. The shoots formed after 30 days were subcultured in full- or half-strength MS medium supplemented with several concentrations of 6-benzyl-amino-purine (BA) or thidiazuron (TDZ). The highest average number and length of shoots was achieved when both full and half-strength MS media were supplemented with 4.0 muM BA. The presence of 4.0 muM TDZ showed also comparable results. BA and TDZ at concentrations of 4.0, 8.0 muM and 2.0, 4.0 muM respectively, displayed the maximum shooting frequency. The new shoots were transferred on the same media and were either self-rooted or after being enhanced with different concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Presence of 2.0 or 4.0 muM IBA or 4.0 muM NAA resulted to the optimum rooting rates. The maximum average number and length of roots per shoot was observed when the culture media was supplemented with 4.0 muM IBA or NAA. Approximately 92% of the plantlets were successfully established and acclimatized in field. The consistency of the chemical profile of the acclimatized in vitro propagated clones was assessed using quantitative 1H-NMR high throughput screening. In each variety, analysis of the micropropagated plant in comparison with the mother plant showed no statistically significant differences (p <= 0.05) in CBD+ cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and CBG+ cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) content respectively, thus indicating stability of their chemical profile.
33333871/An Integrated LC-ESI-MSn and High Resolution LC-ESI-QTOF Approach for the Identification of Phloroglucinols from Nepalese Hypericum japonicum Phloroglucinols are characteristic constituents of Hypericum japonicum that are claimed to exert several bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-depressant and anti-viral ones. Phloroglucinols are unstable compounds and their synthesis is challenging; thus, isolation from natural sources is still one of the main strategies for obtaining these constituents in purified form. Assessing the presence of phloroglucinols in plant materials can be of interest for compound isolation, and LC-MS approaches afford sensitivity and specificity in this regard. In this work, we combined data from quadrupole-time of flight (QTOF) and ion trap (IT) mass spectrometers in order to assess the presence of the phloroglucinols characteristic of H. japonicum and to elucidate their MS fragmentation pathways. The identified compounds present similar structures bearing the 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene core with different substitutions, which, in constituents at higher MW, is linked to 3',3'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-phlorisobutyrophenone by a methylene bridge. Differences in MS2 spectra of the considered phloroglucinols are useful for compound identification and differentiation, and to perform dereplication studies. Overall, the proposed approach could be useful for the analysis of phloroglucinols in H. japonicum and other plant species.
33333896/Actinomycetes Enrich Soil Rhizosphere and Improve Seed Quality as well as Productivity of Legumes by Boosting Nitrogen Availability and Metabolism The use of actinomycetes for improving soil fertility and plant production is an attractive strategy for developing sustainable agricultural systems due to their effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and low production cost. Out of 17 species isolated from the soil rhizosphere of legume crops, 4 bioactive isolates were selected and their impact on 5 legumes: soybean, kidney bean, chickpea, lentil, and pea were evaluated. According to the morphological and molecular identification, these isolates belong to the genus Streptomyces. Here, we showed that these isolates increased soil nutrients and organic matter content and improved soil microbial populations. At the plant level, soil enrichment with actinomycetes increased photosynthetic reactions and eventually increased legume yield. Actinomycetes also increased nitrogen availability in soil and legume tissue and seeds, which induced the activity of key nitrogen metabolizing enzymes, e.g., glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and nitrate reductase. In addition to increased nitrogen-containing amino acids levels, we also report high sugar, organic acids, and fatty acids as well as antioxidant phenolics, mineral, and vitamins levels in actinomycete treated legume seeds, which in turn improved their seed quality. Overall, this study shed the light on the impact of actinomycetes on enhancing the quality and productivity of legume crops by boosting the bioactive primary and secondary metabolites. Moreover, our findings emphasize the positive role of actinomycetes in improving the soil by enriching its microbial population. Therefore, our data reinforce the usage of actinomycetes as biofertilizers to provide sustainable food production and achieve biosafety.
33333992/Antiproliferative and Antiangiogenic Properties of New VEGFR-2-targeting 2-thioxobenzo[g]quinazoline Derivatives (In Vitro) A series of 3-ethyl(methyl)-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrobenzo[g]quinazolines (1-17) were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated in vitro for their antiangiogenesis VEGFR-2-targeting, antiproliferative, and antiapoptotic activities against breast MCF-7 and liver HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine cancer-cell cycle distributions, and apoptosis was detected using annexin-V-FITC (V) and propidium iodide (PI) dyes. Fluorescence microscopy, in combination with Hoechst staining was used to detect DNA fragmentation. Most of the tested benzo[g]quinazolines demonstrated promising activity (IC50 = 8.8 +- 0.5-10.9 +- 0.9 muM) and (IC50 = 26.0 +- 2.5-40.4 +- 4.1 muM) against MCF-7 and HepG2, respectively. Doxorubicin was used as a reference drug. Compounds 13-15 showed the highest activity against both cancer cell lines. Differential effects were detected by cell-cycle analysis, indicating similarities in the actions of 13 and 14 against both MCF7 and HepG2, involving the targeting of G1 and S phases, respectively. Compound 15 showed similar indices against both cells, indicating that its cytotoxicity toward the examined cancer cells could be unselective. Interestingly, 14 and 15 showed the highest apoptosis (30.76% and 25.30%, respectively) against MCF-7. The DNA fragmentation results agreed well with the apoptosis detected by flow cytometry. In terms of antiangiogenesis activity, as derived from VEGFR-2 inhibition, 13 and 15 were comparable to sorafenib and effected 1.5- and 1.4-fold inhibition relative to the standard sorafenib. A docking study was conducted to investigate the interaction between the synthesized benzo[g]quinazolines and the ATP-binding site within the catalytic domain of VEGFR-2.
33333919/A Reliable Enantioselective Route to Mono-Protected N1-Cbz Piperazic Acid Building Block The chiral N1-Cbz, N2-H derivative of the piperazic acid monomer is a valuable building block in the total synthesis of natural products, comprising this nonproteinogenic amino acid. In that context, we wish to report an improved synthetic protocol for the synthesis of both (3R)- and (3S)-piperazic acids bearing the carboxybenzyl protecting group (Cbz) selectively at the N1 position. Our method builds on previously reported protocols, circumventing their potential shortcomings, and optimizing the ultimate selective deprotection at the N2 position, thus, offering an efficient and reproducible pathway to suitably modified piperazates in high optical purity.
33333949/Sol-Gel Entrapped Lewis Acids as Catalysts for Biodiesel Production Replacing fossil fuels with biodiesel enables the emission of greenhouse gases to be decreased and reduces dependence on fossil fuels in countries with poor natural resources. Biodiesel can be produced by an esterification reaction between free fatty acids (FFAs) and methanol or by transesterification of triglycerides from oils. Both reactions require homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Production of biodiesel catalyzed by heterogeneous catalysts seems to be the preferred route, enabling easy product separation. As we have previously shown, the Lewis acids AlCl3 and BF3 can serve as highly efficient catalysts under ultrasonic activation. The present study focused on the development of oleic acid (OA) esterification with methanol by the same catalysts immobilized in silica matrices using the sol-gel synthesis route. During the course of immobilization, AlCl3 converts to AlCl3 x 6H2O (aluminite) and BF3 is hydrolyzed with the production of B2O3. The immobilized catalysts can be reused or involved in a continuous process. The possibility of biodiesel production using immobilized catalysts under ultrasonic activation is shown for the conversion of FFAs into biodiesel in batch and continuous mode.
33333920/(Z,Z)-Selanediylbis(2-propenamides): Novel Class of Organoselenium Compounds with High Glutathione Peroxidase-Like Activity. Regio- and Stereoselective Reaction of Sodium Selenide with 3-Trimethylsilyl-2-propynamides The efficient regio- and stereoselective synthesis of (Z,Z)-3,3'-selanediylbis(2-propenamides) in 76-93% yields was developed based on the reaction of sodium selenide with 3-trimethylsilyl-2-propynamides. (Z,Z)-3,3'-Selanediylbis(2-propenamides) are a novel class of organoselenium compounds. To date, not a single representative of 3,3'-selanediylbis(2-propenamides) has been described in the literature. Studying glutathione peroxidase-like properties by a model reaction showed that the activity of the obtained products significantly varies depending on the organic moieties in the amide group. Divinyl selenide, which contains two lipophilic cyclohexyl substituents in the amide group, exhibits very high glutathione peroxidase-like activity and this compound is considerably superior to other products in this respect.
33334031/Covalently Immobilized Battacin Lipopeptide Gels with Activity against Bacterial Biofilms Novel antibiotic treatments are in increasing demand to tackle life-threatening infections from bacterial pathogens. In this study, we report the use of a potent battacin lipopeptide as an antimicrobial gel to inhibit planktonic and mature biofilms of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial gels were made by covalently linking the N-terminal cysteine containing lipopeptide (GZ3.163) onto the polyethylene glycol polymer matrix and initiating gelation using thiol-ene click chemistry. The gels were prepared both in methanol and in water and were characterised using rheology, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antibacterial and antibiofilm analyses revealed that the gels prepared in methanol have better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Additionally, a minimum peptide content of 0.5 wt% (relative to polymer content) is required to successfully inhibit the planktonic bacterial growth and disperse mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The antibacterial activity of these lipopeptide gels is mediated by a contact kill mechanism of action. The gels are non-haemolytic against mouse red blood cells and are non-cytotoxic against human dermal fibroblasts. Findings from this study show that battacin lipopeptide gels have the potential to be developed as novel topical antibacterial agents to combat skin infections, particularly caused by S. aureus.
33339088/High-Toughness Poly(lactic Acid)/Starch Blends Prepared through Reactive Blending Plasticization and Compatibilization In this study, poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/starch blends were prepared through reactive melt blending by using PLA and starch as raw materials and vegetable oil polyols, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and citric acid (CA) as additives. The effects of CA and PEG on the toughness of PLA/starch blends were analyzed using a mechanical performance test, scanning electron microscope analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, rheological analysis, and hydrophilicity test. Results showed that the elongation at break and impact strength of the PLA/premixed starch (PSt)/PEG/CA blend were 140.51% and 3.56 kJ m-2, which were 13.4 and 1.8 times higher than those of pure PLA, respectively. The essence of the improvement in the toughness of the PLA/PSt/PEG/CA blend was the esterification reaction among CA, PEG, and starch. During the melt-blending process, the CA with abundant carboxyl groups reacted in the amorphous region of the starch. The shape and crystal form of the starch did not change, but the surface activity of the starch improved and consequently increased the adhesion between starch and PLA. As a plasticizer for PLA and starch, PEG effectively enhanced the mobility of the molecular chains. After PEG was dispersed, it participated in the esterification reaction of CA and starch at the interface and formed a branched/crosslinked copolymer that was embedded in the interface of PLA and starch. This copolymer further improved the compatibility of the PLA/starch blends. PEGs with small molecules and CA were used as compatibilizers to reduce the effect on PLA biodegradability. The esterification reaction on the starch surface improved the compatibilization and toughness of the PLA/starch blend materials and broadens their application prospects in the fields of medicine and high-fill packaging.
33334041/Flammability Tests and Investigations of Properties of Lignin-Containing Polymer Composites Based on Acrylates In this paper flammability tests and detailed investigations of lignin-containing polymer composites' properties are presented. Composites were obtained using bisphenol A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate (BPA.GDA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and kraft lignin (lignin alkali, L) during UV curing. In order to evaluate the influence of lignin modification and the addition of flame retardant compounds on the thermal resistance of the obtained biocomposites, flammability tests have been conducted. After the modification with phosphoric acid (V) lignin, as well as diethyl vinylphosphonate, were used as flame retardant additives. The changes in the chemical structures (ATR-FTIR), as well as the influence of the different additives on the hardness, thermal (TG) and mechanical properties were discussed in detail. The samples after the flammability test were also studied to assess their thermal destruction.
33334079/Homocoupling Reactions of Azoles and Their Applications in Coordination Chemistry Pyrazole, a member of the structural class of azoles, exhibits molecular properties of interest in pharmaceuticals and materials chemistry, owing to the two adjacent nitrogen atoms in the five-membered ring system. The weakly basic nitrogen atoms of deprotonated pyrazoles have been applied in coordination chemistry, particularly to access coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks, and homocoupling reactions can in principle provide facile access to bipyrazole ligands. In this context, we summarize recent advances in homocoupling reactions of pyrazoles and other types of azoles (imidazoles, triazoles and tetrazoles) to highlight the utility of homocoupling reactions in synthesizing symmetric bi-heteroaryl systems compared with traditional synthesis. Metal-free reactions and transition-metal catalyzed homocoupling reactions are discussed with reaction mechanisms in detail.
33339083/Diosgenin Loaded Polymeric Nanoparticles with Potential Anticancer Efficacy This study aims to determine the anticancer efficacy of diosgenin encapsulated poly-glycerol malate co-dodecanedioate (PGMD) nanoparticles. Diosgenin loaded PGMD nanoparticles (variants 7:3 and 6:4) were synthesized by the nanoprecipitation method. The synthesis of PGMD nanoparticles was systematically optimized employing the Box-Behnken design and taking into account the influence of various independent variables such as concentrations of each PGMD, diosgenin and PF-68 on the responses such as size and PDI of the particles. Mathematical modeling was done using the Quadratic second order modeling method and response surface analysis was undertaken to elucidate the factor-response relationship. The obtained size of PGMD 7:3 and PGMD 6:4 nanoparticles were 133.6 nm and 121.4 nm, respectively, as measured through dynamic light scattering (DLS). The entrapment efficiency was in the range of 77-83%. The in vitro drug release studies showed diffusion and dissolution controlled drug release pattern following Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model. Furthermore, in vitro morphological and cytotoxic studies were performed to evaluate the toxicity of synthesized drug loaded nanoparticles in model cell lines. The IC50 after 48 h was observed to be 27.14 microM, 15.15 microM and 13.91 microM for free diosgenin, PGMD 7:3 and PGMD 6:4 nanoparticles, respectively, when administered in A549 lung carcinoma cell lines.
33339190/S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine Hydrolase: A Structural Perspective on the Enzyme with Two Rossmann-Fold Domains S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) is a major regulator of cellular methylation reactions that occur in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. SAHase activity is also a significant source of l-homocysteine and adenosine, two compounds involved in numerous vital, as well as pathological processes. Therefore, apart from cellular methylation, the enzyme may also influence other processes important for the physiology of particular organisms. Herein, presented is the structural characterization and comparison of SAHases of eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin, with an emphasis on the two principal domains of SAHase subunit based on the Rossmann motif. The first domain is involved in the binding of a substrate, e.g., S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine or adenosine and the second domain binds the NAD+ cofactor. Despite their structural similarity, the molecular interactions between an adenosine-based ligand molecule and macromolecular environment are different in each domain. As a consequence, significant differences in the conformation of d-ribofuranose rings of nucleoside and nucleotide ligands, especially those attached to adenosine moiety, are observed. On the other hand, the chemical nature of adenine ring recognition, as well as an orientation of the adenine ring around the N-glycosidic bond are of high similarity for the ligands bound in the substrate- and cofactor-binding domains.
33348871/Baicalein, 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone and Myricetin as Potent Inhibitors of Human Ornithine Decarboxylase Background: Human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a well-known oncogene, and the discovery of ODC enzyme inhibitors is a beneficial strategy for cancer therapy and prevention. Methods: We examined the inhibitory effects of a variety of flavone and flavonol derivatives on ODC enzymatic activity, and performed in silico molecular docking of baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and myricetin to the whole dimer of human ODC to investigate the possible binding site of these compounds on ODC. We also examined the cytotoxic effects of these compounds with cell-based studies. Results: Baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and myricetin exhibited significant ODC suppression activity with IC50 values of 0.88 microM, 2.54 microM, and 7.3 microM, respectively, which were much lower than that of the active-site irreversible inhibitor alpha-DL-difluoromethylornithine (IC50, the half maximal inhibitory concentration, of approximately 100 microM). Kinetic studies and molecular docking simulations suggested that baicalein, and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone act as noncompetitive inhibitors that are hydrogen-bonded to the region near the active site pocket in the dimer interface of the enzyme. Baicalein and myricetin suppress cell growth and induce cellular apoptosis, and both of these compounds suppress the ODC-evoked anti-apoptosis of cells. Conclusions: Therefore, we suggest that the flavone or flavonol derivatives baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and myricetin are potent chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents that target ODC.
33352963/Antimicrobial Constituents from Machaerium Pers.: Inhibitory Activities and Synergism of Machaeriols and Machaeridiols against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium, and Permeabilized Gram-Negative Pathogens Two new epimeric bibenzylated monoterpenes machaerifurogerol (1a) and 5-epi-machaerifurogerol (1b), and four known isoflavonoids (+)-vestitol (2), 7-O-methylvestitol (3), (+)-medicarpin (4), and 3,8-dihydroxy-9-methoxypterocarpan (5) were isolated from Machaerium Pers. This plant was previously assigned as Machaerium multiflorum Spruce, from which machaeriols A-D (6-9) and machaeridiols A-C (10-12) were reported, and all were then re-isolated, except the minor compound 9, for a comprehensive antimicrobial activity evaluation. Structures of the isolated compounds were determined by full NMR and mass spectroscopic data. Among the isolated compounds, the mixture 10 + 11 was the most active with an MIC value of 1.25 mug/mL against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains BAA 1696, -1708, -1717, -33591, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE 700221) and E. faecalis (VRE 51299) and vancomycin-sensitive E. faecalis (VSE 29212). Compounds 6-8 and 10-12 were found to be more potent against MRSA 1708, and 6, 11, and 12 against VRE 700221, than the drug control ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. A combination study using an in vitro Checkerboard method was carried out for machaeriols (7 or 8) and machaeridiols (11 or 12), which exhibited a strong synergistic activity of 12 + 8 (MIC 0.156 and 0.625 microg/mL), with >32- and >8-fold reduction of MIC's, compared to 12, against MRSA 1708 and -1717, respectively. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations on polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), compounds 10 + 11, 11, 12, and 8 showed activity in the range of 0.5-8 microg/mL for two strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, 2-16 microg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and 2 microg/mL against Escherichia coli NCTC 12923, but were inactive (MIC > 64 microg/mL) against the two isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
33348591/Sterically Facilitated Intramolecular Nucleophilic NMe2 Group Substitution in the Synthesis of Fused Isoxazoles: Theoretical Study The influence of steric repulsion between the NMe2 group and a second ortho-(peri-)substituent in the series of 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene and N,N-dimethylanilene ortho-oximes on the ease of the NMe2 group's intramolecular nucleophilic substitution is studied. Possible reaction intermediates for three mechanisms are calculated (omegaB97xd/def-2-TZVP), and their free Gibbs energies are compared to model reaction profiles. Supporting experiments have proved the absence of studied reactivity in the case of simple 2-dimethylaminobenzaldoxime, which allowed us to establish reactivity limits. The significant facilitation of NMe2 group displacement in the presence of bulky substituents is demonstrated. The possibility of fused isoxazoles synthesis via the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a protonated NMe2 group in the aniline and naphthalene series is predicted.
33353192/Structure and State of Water in Branched N-Vinylpyrrolidone Copolymers as Carriers of a Hydrophilic Biologically Active Compound Hydrated copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone (VP) with triethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a promising platform for biologically active compounds (BAC) were investigated by different physical chemical methods (dynamic light scattering, infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry) and the quantum chemical modeling of water coordination by the copolymers in a solution. According to the quantum chemical simulation, one to two water molecules can coordinate on one O-atom of the lactam ring of VP units in the copolymer. Besides the usual terminal coordination, the water molecule can form bridges to bind two adjacent C=O groups of the lactam rings of VP units. In addition to the first hydration shell, the formation of a second one is also possible due to the chain addition of water molecules, and its structure depends on a mutual orientation of C=O groups. We showed that N,N-dimethylbiguanidine hydrochloride (metformin) as a frontline drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus can be associated in aqueous solutions with free and hydrated C=O groups of the lactam rings of VP units in studied copolymers. Based on the characteristics of the H-bonds, we believe that the level of the copolymer hydration does not affect the behavior and biological activity of this drug, but the binding of metformin with the amphiphilic copolymer will delight in the penetration of a hydrophilic drug across a cell membrane to increase its bioavailability.
33353126/Halogen-Induced Controllable Cyclizations as Diverse Heterocycle Synthetic Strategy In organic synthesis, due to their high electrophilicity and leaving group properties, halogens play pivotal roles in the activation and structural derivations of organic compounds. Recently, cyclizations induced by halogen groups that allow the production of diverse targets and the structural reorganization of organic molecules have attracted significant attention from synthetic chemists. Electrophilic halogen atoms activate unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbon moieties by generating halonium intermediates, followed by the attack of carbon-containing, nitrogen-containing, oxygen-containing, and sulfur-containing nucleophiles to give highly functionalized carbocycles and heterocycles. New transformations of halogenated organic molecules that can control the formation and stereoselectivity of the products, according to the difference in the size and number of halogen atoms, have recently been discovered. These unique cyclizations may possibly be used as efficient synthetic strategies with future advances. In this review, innovative reactions controlled by halogen groups are discussed as a new concept in the field of organic synthesis.
33348712/Antiproliferative Phenanthrenes from Juncus tenuis: Isolation and Diversity-Oriented Semisynthetic Modification The occurrence of phenanthrenes is limited in nature, with such compounds identified only in some plant families. Phenanthrenes were described to have a wide range of pharmacological activities, and numerous research programs have targeted semisynthetic derivatives of the phenanthrene skeleton. The aims of this study were the phytochemical investigation of Juncus tenuis, focusing on the isolation of phenanthrenes, and the preparation of semisynthetic derivatives of the isolated compounds. From the methanolic extract of J. tenuis, three phenanthrenes (juncusol, effusol, and 2,7-dihydroxy-1,8-dimethyl-5-vinyl-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene) were isolated. Juncusol and effusol were transformed by hypervalent iodine(III) reagent, using a diversity-oriented approach. Four racemic semisynthetic compounds possessing an alkyl-substituted p-quinol ring (1-4) were produced. Isolation and purification of the compounds were carried out by different chromatographic techniques, and their structures were elucidated by means of 1D and 2D NMR, and HRMS spectroscopic methods. The isolated secondary metabolites and their semisynthetic analogues were tested on seven human tumor cell lines (A2780, A2780cis, KCR, MCF-7, HeLa, HTB-26, and T47D) and on one normal cell line (MRC-5), using the MTT assay. The effusol derivative 3, substituted with two methoxy groups, showed promising antiproliferative activity on MCF-7, T47D, and A2780 cell lines with IC50 values of 5.8, 7.0, and 8.6 microM, respectively.
33352824/Vitamin C Transporters and Their Implications in Carcinogenesis Vitamin C is implicated in various bodily functions due to its unique properties in redox homeostasis. Moreover, vitamin C also plays a great role in restoring the activity of 2-oxoglutarate and Fe2+ dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDD), which are involved in active DNA demethylation (TET proteins), the demethylation of histones, and hypoxia processes. Therefore, vitamin C may be engaged in the regulation of gene expression or in a hypoxic state. Hence, vitamin C has acquired great interest for its plausible effects on cancer treatment. Since its conceptualization, the role of vitamin C in cancer therapy has been a controversial and disputed issue. Vitamin C is transferred to the cells with sodium dependent transporters (SVCTs) and glucose transporters (GLUT). However, it is unknown whether the impaired function of these transporters may lead to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Notably, previous studies have identified SVCTs' polymorphisms or their altered expression in some types of cancer. This review discusses the potential effects of vitamin C and the impaired SVCT function in cancers. The variations in vitamin C transporter genes may regulate the active transport of vitamin C, and therefore have an impact on cancer risk, but further studies are needed to thoroughly elucidate their involvement in cancer biology.
33352636/Measurement of Serum Testosterone in Nondiabetic Young Obese Men: Comparison of Direct Immunoassay to Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Hypoandrogenemia, a frequent finding in men with obesity, is defined by low concentrations of serum testosterone. Although immunoassay (IA) is the most used method for the determination of this steroid in clinical practice, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered a more reliable method. In this study, we aimed to compare IA versus LC-MS/MS measurement for the diagnosis of hypoandrogenemia in a cohort of 273 nondiabetic young obese men. Mean total testosterone (TT) levels were 3.20 +- 1.24 ng/mL for IA and 3.78 +- 1.4 ng/mL for LC-MS/MS. 53.7% and 26.3% of patients were classified as presenting hypoandrogenemia with IA and LC-MS/MS, respectively. Considering LC-MS/MS as the reference method, sensitivity and specificity of IA were 91.4% (95% CI 82.3-96.8) and 61.1% (95% CI 54.0-67.8), respectively. IA presented an AUC of 0.879 (95% CI 0.83-0.928). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (p = 0.002) and insulin resistance (p = 0.008) were factors associated with discrepant IA values. In conclusion, the determination of TT by IA in nondiabetic young men with obesity yields lower concentrations of TT than LC-MS/MS, resulting in an equivocal increased diagnosis of hypoandrogenemia, which could lead to inaccurate diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.
33352884/Agaricus bisporus Crude Extract: Characterization and Analytical Application In the present work crude Agaricus bisporus extract (ABE) has been prepared and characterized by its tyrosinase activity, protein composition and substrate specificity. The presence of mushroom tyrosinase (PPO3) in ABE has been confirmed using two-dimensional electrophoresis, followed by MALDI TOF/TOF MS-based analysis. GH27 alpha-glucosidases, GH47 alpha-mannosidases, GH20 hexosaminidases, and alkaline phosphatases have been also detected in ABE. ABE substrate specificity has been studied using 19 phenolic compounds: polyphenols (catechol, gallic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and ferulic acids, quercetin, rutin, dihydroquercetin, l-dihydroxyphenylalanine, resorcinol, propyl gallate) and monophenols (l-tyrosine, phenol, p-nitrophenol, o-nitrophenol, guaiacol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol). The comparison of ABE substrate specificity and affinity to the corresponding parameters of purified A. bisporus tyrosinase has revealed no major differences. The conditions for spectrophotometric determination have been chosen and the analytical procedures for determination of 1.4 x 10-4-1.0 x 10-3 M l-tyrosine, 3.1 x 10-6-1.0 x 10-4 M phenol, 5.4 x 10-5-1.0 x 10-3 M catechol, 8.5 x 10-5-1.0 x 10-3 M caffeic acid, 1.5 x 10-4-7.5 x 10-4 M chlorogenic acid, 6.8 x 10-5-1.0 x 10-3 M l-DOPA have been proposed. The procedures have been applied for the determination of l-tyrosine in food supplements, l-DOPA in synthetic serum, and phenol in waste water from the food manufacturing plant. Thus, we have demonstrated the possibility of using ABE as a substitute for tyrosinase in such analytical applications, as food supplements, medical and environmental analysis.
33339246/Biochar-Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Adorned with Ionic Liquid Containing Acidic Polymer: A Versatile, Non-Metallic Catalyst for Acid Catalyzed Reaction A novel biochar-based graphitic carbon nitride was prepared through calcination of Zinnia grandiflora petals and urea. To provide acidic and ionic-liquid functionalities on the prepared carbon, the resultant biochar-based graphitic carbon nitride was vinyl functionalized and polymerized with 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, acrylic acid and the as-prepared 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride. The final catalytic system that benefits from both acidic (-COOH and -SO3H) and ionic-liquid functionalities was applied as a versatile, metal-free catalyst for promoting some model acid catalyzed reactions such as Knoevenagel condensation and Biginelli reaction in aqueous media under a very mild reaction condition. The results confirmed high activity of the catalyst. Broad substrate scope and recyclability and stability of the catalyst were other merits of the developed protocols. Comparative experiments also indicated that both acidic and ionic-liquid functionalities on the catalyst participated in the catalysis.
33339444/On the Liquid Chemistry of the Reactive Nitrogen Species Peroxynitrite and Nitrogen Dioxide Generated by Physical Plasmas Cold physical plasmas modulate cellular redox signaling processes, leading to the evolution of a number of clinical applications in recent years. They are a source of small reactive species, including reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Wound healing is a major application and, as its physiology involves RNS signaling, a correlation between clinical effectiveness and the activity of plasma-derived RNS seems evident. To investigate the type and reactivity of plasma-derived RNS in aqueous systems, a model with tyrosine as a tracer was utilized. By high-resolution mass spectrometry, 26 different tyrosine derivatives including the physiologic nitrotyrosine were identified. The product pattern was distinctive in terms of plasma parameters, especially gas phase composition. By scavenger experiments and isotopic labelling, gaseous nitric dioxide radicals and liquid phase peroxynitrite ions were determined as dominant RNS. The presence of water molecules in the active plasma favored the generation of peroxynitrite. A pilot study, identifying RNS driven post-translational modifications of proteins in healing human wounds after the treatment with cold plasma (kINPen), demonstrated the presence of in vitro determined chemical pathways. The plasma-driven nitration and nitrosylation of tyrosine allows the conclusion that covalent modification of biomolecules by RNS contributes to the clinically observed impact of cold plasmas.
33353137/The [DPPH /DPPH-H]-HPLC-DAD Method on Tracking the Antioxidant Activity of Pure Antioxidants and Goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria L.) Hydroalcoholic Extracts The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-reverse phase (RP)-HPLC-diode array detector (DAD) method was tested on standard antioxidants (AOs), i.e., reduced glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and alcoholic extracts of A. podagraria L. An elaborated HPLC procedure enabled the simultaneous measurement of the redox couple DPPH-R (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical)/DPPH-H (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine). Both forms were fully separated (Rs = 2.30, alpha = 1.65) on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column eluted with methanol-water (80:20, v/v) and detected at different wavelengths in the range of 200-600 nm. The absorbance increases of the DPPH-H as well as the DPPH-R peak inhibition were measured at different wavelengths in visible and UV ranges. The chromatographic method was optimized, according to reaction time (slow, fast kinetics), the linearity range of DPPH radical depending on the detection conditions as well as the kind of the investigated antioxidants (reference chemicals and the ground elder prepared from fresh and dry plants). The scavenging capacity was expressed by the use of percentage of peak inhibition and the IC50 parameters. The evaluated extracts displayed antioxidant activity, higher than 20% inhibition against 350 microM DPPH free radical. The results show that extract prepared from dry plants in the ultrasonic bath exhibits the highest antioxidant potential (IC50 = 64.74 +- 0.22 microL/mL). 
33348592/Sea Anemone Heteractis crispa Actinoporin Demonstrates In Vitro Anticancer Activities and Prevents HT-29 Colorectal Cancer Cell Migration Actinoporins are the most abundant group of sea anemone cytolytic toxins. Their membranolytic activity is of high interest for the development of novel anticancer drugs. However, to date the activity of actinoporins in malignant cells has been poorly studied. Here, we report on recombinant analog of Hct-S3 (rHct-S3), belonging to the combinatory library of Heteractis crispa actinoporins. rHct-S3 exhibited cytotoxic activity against breast MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 7.3 microM), colorectal HT-29 (IC50 = 6.8 microM), and melanoma SK-MEL-28 (IC50 = 8.3 microM) cancer cells. The actinoporin effectively prevented epidermal growth factor -induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells by 34% +- 0.2 and decreased colony formation of HT-29 cells by 47% +- 0.9, MDA-MB-231 cells by 37% +- 1.2, and SK-MEL-28 cells by 34% +- 3.6. Moreover, rHct-S3 decreased proliferation and suppressed migration of colorectal carcinoma cells by 31% +- 5.0 and 99% +- 6.4, respectively. The potent anti-migratory activity was proposed to mediate by decreased matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 expression. In addition, rHct-S3 induced programmed cell death by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, as well as regulation of Bax and Bcl-2. Our results indicate rHct-S3 to be a promising anticancer drug with a high anti-migratory potential.
33352938/Role of Hydrogen Sulfide and 3-Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase in the Regulation of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Hepatocytes It is estimated that over 1.5 billion people suffer from various forms of chronic liver disease worldwide. The emerging prevalence of metabolic syndromes and alcohol misuse, along with the lack of disease-modifying agents for the therapy of many severe liver conditions predicts that chronic liver disease will continue to be a major problem in the future. Better understanding of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms and identification of potential therapeutic targets remains a priority. Herein, we explored the potential role of the 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase/hydrogen sulfide (H2S) system in the regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and of its downstream processes in the immortalized hepatic cell line HepG2 in vitro. ER stress suppressed endogenous H2S levels and pharmacological supplementation of H2S with sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) mitigated many aspects of ER stress, culminating in improved cellular bioenergetics and prevention of autophagic arrest, thereby switching cells' fate towards survival. Genetic silencing of 3-MST or pharmacological inhibition of the key enzymes involved in hepatocyte H2S biosynthesis exacerbated many readouts related to ER-stress or its downstream functional responses. Our findings implicate the 3-MST/H2S system in the intracellular network that governs proteostasis and ER-stress adaptability in hepatocytes and reinforce the therapeutic potential of pharmacological H2S supplementation.
33352910/Improvement of Naturally Derived Food Colorant Performance with Efficient Pyranoanthocyanin Formation from Sambucus nigra Anthocyanins Using Caffeic Acid and Heat Consumers and regulations encourage the use of naturally derived food colorants. Anthocyanins (ACN), plant pigments, are unstable in foods. In aged red wines, ACN with a free hydroxyl group at C-5 condenses to form pyranoanthocyanins (PACN), which are more stable but form inefficiently. This study attempted to produce PACN efficiently using high cofactor concentration and heat. Elderberry anthocyanins were semi-purified and caffeic acid (CA) was dissolved in 15% ethanol and diluted with a buffer to achieve ACN:CA molar ratios of 1:50, 1:100, 1:150, and 1:200, then incubated at 65  C for 5 days. The effect of temperature was tested using ACN samples incubated with or without CA at 25  C, 50  C, and 75  C for 7 days. Compositional changes were monitored using uHPLC-PDA-MS/MS. Higher CA levels seemed to protect pigment integrity, with ACN:CA 1:150 ratio showing the highest tinctorial strength after 48 h. PACN content growth was fastest between 24 and 48 h for all ACN:CA ratios and after 120 h, all ACN had degraded or converted to PACN. PACN formed faster at higher temperatures, reaching ~90% PACN in 24 h and ~100% PACN in 48 h at 75  C. These results suggest that PACN can form efficiently from elderberry ACN and CA if heated to produce more stable pigments.
33348678/No Influence of the Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Gene rs9939609 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism on Blood Lipids in Young Males The fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 A-allele is linked to obesity and dyslipidemia, yet the independent influence of this polymorphism on blood lipids remains equivocal. We examined the influence of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism on fasting and postprandial blood lipids in individuals homozygous for the risk A-allele or T-allele with similar anthropometric and demographic characteristics. 12 AA and 12 TT males consumed a standardized meal after fasting overnight. Blood samples were collected at baseline (-1.5 h), before the meal (0 h), and for five hours postprandially to measure lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Time-averaged total area under the curve (TAUC) values (0-5 h) were calculated and compared between genotypes. Fasting triacylglycerol (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glucose, and insulin concentrations were similar between groups (p >= 0.293). TAUC for TG was similar in AAs and TTs (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to 0.31 mmol/L/h; p = 0.606). Likewise, TAUC values were similar for NEFA (95% CI -0.04 to 0.03 mmol/L/h; p = 0.734), glucose (95% CI -0.41 to 0.44 mmol/L/h; p = 0.951), and insulin (95% CI -6.87 to 2.83 pmol/L/h; p = 0.395). Blood lipids are not influenced by the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism, suggesting the FTO-dyslipidemia link is mediated by adiposity and weight management is important in preventing FTO-related lipid variations.
33339382/Cyclic RGD and isoDGR Integrin Ligands Containing cis-2-amino-1-cyclopentanecarboxylic (cis-beta-ACPC) Scaffolds Integrin ligands containing the tripeptide sequences Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and iso-Asp-Gly- Arg (isoDGR) were actively investigated as inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis and directing unit in tumor-targeting drug conjugates. Reported herein is the synthesis, of two RGD and one isoDGR cyclic peptidomimetics containing (1S,2R) and (1R,2S) cis-2-amino-1-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (cis-beta-ACPC), using a mixed solid phase/solution phase synthetic protocol. The three ligands were examined in vitro in competitive binding assays to the purified alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 receptors using biotinylated vitronectin (alphavbeta3) and fibronectin (alpha5beta1) as natural displaced ligands. The IC50 values of the ligands ranged from nanomolar (the two RGD ligands) to micromolar (the isoDGR ligand) with a pronounced selectivity for alphavbeta3 over alpha5beta1. In vitro cell adhesion assays were also performed using the human skin melanoma cell line WM115 (rich in integrin alphavbeta3). The two RGD ligands showed IC50 values in the same micromolar range as the reference compound (cyclo[RGDfV]), while for the isoDGR derivative an IC50 value could not be measured for the cell adhesion assay. A conformational analysis of the free RGD and isoDGR ligands by NMR (VT-NMR and NOESY experiments) and computational studies (MC/EM and MD), followed by docking simulations performed in the alphaVbeta3 integrin active site, provided a rationale for the behavior of these ligands toward the receptor.
33352899/Epipyrone A, a Broad-Spectrum Antifungal Compound Produced by Epicoccum nigrum ICMP 19927 We have isolated a filamentous fungus that actively secretes a pigmented exudate when growing on agar plates. The fungus was identified as being a strain of Epicoccum nigrum. The fungal exudate presented strong antifungal activity against both yeasts and filamentous fungi, and inhibited the germination of fungal spores. The chemical characterization of the exudate showed that the pigmented molecule presenting antifungal activity is the disalt of epipyrone A:a water-soluble polyene metabolite with a molecular mass of 612.29 and maximal UV-Vis absorbance at 428 nm. This antifungal compound showed excellent stability to different temperatures and neutral to alkaline pH.
33353176/Macrocybin, a Natural Mushroom Triglyceride, Reduces Tumor Growth In Vitro and In Vivo through Caveolin-Mediated Interference with the Actin Cytoskeleton Mushrooms have been used for millennia as cancer remedies. Our goal was to screen several mushroom species from the rainforests of Costa Rica, looking for new antitumor molecules. Mushroom extracts were screened using two human cell lines: A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) and NL20 (immortalized normal lung epithelium). Extracts able to kill tumor cells while preserving non-tumor cells were considered "anticancer". The mushroom with better properties was Macrocybe titans. Positive extracts were fractionated further and tested for biological activity on the cell lines. The chemical structure of the active compound was partially elucidated through nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and other ancillary techniques. Chemical analysis showed that the active molecule was a triglyceride containing oleic acid, palmitic acid, and a more complex fatty acid with two double bonds. The synthesis of all possible triglycerides and biological testing identified the natural compound, which was named Macrocybin. A xenograft study showed that Macrocybin significantly reduces A549 tumor growth. In addition, Macrocybin treatment resulted in the upregulation of Caveolin-1 expression and the disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton in tumor cells (but not in normal cells). In conclusion, we have shown that Macrocybin constitutes a new biologically active compound that may be taken into consideration for cancer treatment.
33353244/Glycoconjugation of Betulin Derivatives Using Copper-Catalyzed 1,3-Dipolar Azido-Alkyne Cycloaddition Reaction and a Preliminary Assay of Cytotoxicity of the Obtained Compounds Pentacyclic lupane-type triterpenoids, such as betulin and its synthetic derivatives, display a broad spectrum of biological activity. However, one of the major drawbacks of these compounds as potential therapeutic agents is their high hydrophobicity and low bioavailability. On the other hand, the presence of easily transformable functional groups in the parent structure makes betulin have a high synthetic potential and the ability to form different derivatives. In this context, research on the synthesis of new betulin derivatives as conjugates of naturally occurring triterpenoid with a monosaccharide via a linker containing a heteroaromatic 1,2,3-triazole ring was presented. It has been shown that copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC) provides an easy and effective way to synthesize new molecular hybrids based on natural products. The chemical structures of the obtained betulin glycoconjugates were confirmed by spectroscopic analysis. Cytotoxicity of the obtained compounds was evaluated on a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) and colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT 116). The obtained results show that despite the fact that the obtained betulin glycoconjugates do not show interesting antitumor activity, the idea of adding a sugar unit to the betulin backbone may, after some modifications, turn out to be correct and allow for the targeted transport of betulin glycoconjugates into the tumor cells.
33353130/Terroir Effect on the Phenolic Composition and Chromatic Characteristics of Mencia/Jaen Monovarietal Wines: Bierzo D.O. (Spain) and Dao D.O. (Portugal) 'Mencia'/'Jaen' it's an important red grape variety, exclusive of the Iberian Peninsula, used in wine production namely in Bierzo D.O. and Dao D.O., respectively. This work evaluates the effect of the two different "terroirs" on the phenolic composition and chromatic characteristics of 'Mencia'/'Jaen' monovarietal wines produced at an industrial scale in the same vintage. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares-Discrimination Analysis (PLS-DA), and Orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) it was found that peonidin-3-coumaroylglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-coumaroylglucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-acetylglucoside, malvidin-3-glucoside, and ferulic acid were the phenolic compounds with the highest differences between the two regions. PLS regression allowed to correlate the differences in lightness (L*) and redness (a*) of wines from 'Jaen' and 'Mencia' to differences in colored anthocyanins, polymeric pigments, total pigments, total anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-acetylglucoside, delphinidin-3-acetylglucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-coumaroylglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside and malvidin-3-glucoside in wines, and the colorless ferulic, caffeic, and coutaric acids, and ethyl caffeate. The wines a* values were more affected by colored anthocyanins, ferulic acid, total anthocyanins, delphinidin-3-acetylglucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and petunidin-3-acetylglucoside, and catechin. The positive influence of ferulic acid in the a* values and ferulic, caffeic, coutaric acids, and ethyl caffeate on the L* values can be due to the co-pigmentation phenomena. The higher dryness and lower temperatures during the September nights in this vintage might explain the differences observed in the anthocyanin content and chromatic characteristics of the wines.
33353070/Computational Insights into Allosteric Conformational Modulation of P-Glycoprotein by Substrate and Inhibitor Binding The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a physiologically essential membrane protein that protects many tissues against xenobiotic molecules, but limits the access of chemotherapeutics into tumor cells, thus contributing to multidrug resistance. The atomic-level mechanism of how substrates and inhibitors differentially affect the ATP hydrolysis by P-gp remains to be elucidated. In this work, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit membrane/water environment were performed to explore the effects of substrate and inhibitor binding on the conformational dynamics of P-gp. Distinct differences in conformational changes that mainly occurred in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) were observed from the substrate- and inhibitor-bound simulations. The binding of rhodamine-123 can increase the probability of the formation of an intermediate conformation, in which the NBDs were closer and better aligned, suggesting that substrate binding may prime the transporter for ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, the inhibitor QZ-Leu stabilized NBDs in a much more separated and misaligned conformation, which may result in the deficiency of ATP hydrolysis. The significant differences in conformational modulation of P-gp by substrate and inhibitor binding provided a molecular explanation of how these small molecules exert opposite effects on the ATPase activity. A further structural analysis suggested that the allosteric communication between transmembrane domains (TMDs) and NBDs was primarily mediated by two intracellular coupling helices. Our computational simulations provide not only valuable insights into the transport mechanism of P-gp substrates, but also for the molecular design of P-gp inhibitors.
33348773/Improvement of Hypertriglyceridemia by Roasted Nelumbinis folium in High Fat/High Cholesterol Diet Rat Model Hypertriglyceridemia is a condition characterized by high triglyceride levels and is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. The present study was designed to investigate the inhibitory effect of roasted Nelumbinis folium (RN), which is a medicinal substance produced by heating lotus leaves, on lipid metabolism in high fat/cholesterol (HFC) diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Except for those in the control group, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HFC diet for four weeks to induce hypertriglyceridemia. During the next nine weeks, the control, regular diet; HFC, HFC diet, FLU, fluvastatin (3 mg/kg/day); RNL, RN (100 mg/kg/day); RNH, RN (200 mg/kg/day) were orally administered together with the diet, and the experiments were conducted for a total of 13 weeks. The weight of the epididymal adipose tissue, liver, and heart of rats in the HFC diet group significantly increased compared to those in the control group but improved in the RN-treated group. It was also confirmed that vascular function, which is damaged by an HFC diet, was improved after RN treatment. The levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein increased in the HFC diet group compared to those in the control group, while the administration of RN attenuated these parameters. In addition, the administration of RN significantly reduced the gene expression of both LXR and SREBP-1, which indicated the inhibitory effect of the biosynthesis of triglycerides caused by RN. The results indicated that RN administration resulted in an improvement in the overall lipid metabolism and a decrease in the concentration of triglycerides in the HFC diet-induced rat model of hypertriglyceridemia. Therefore, our findings suggest that the RN can be a candidate material to provide a new direction for treating hypertriglyceridemia.
33348758/Catechin Photolysis Suppression by Aluminum Chloride under Alkaline Conditions and Assessment with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Tea is rich in catechins and aluminum. In this study, the process of catechin photolysis was applied as a model for examining the effects of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) on the structural changes of catechin and the alteration of aluminum complexes under blue light irradiation (BLI) at pH 8 using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. Additionally, the effects of anions on catechin upon the addition of AlCl3 and treatment with BLI were also studied. In this study, when 1 mM catechin was treated with BLI, a superoxide anion radical  was generated in an air-saturated aqueous solution, in addition to forming a dimeric catechin (proanthocyanidin) via a photon-induced redox reaction. The relative percentage of catechin was found to be 59.0 and 95.7 for catechin treated with BLI and catechin upon the addition of 1 mM AlCl3 treated with BLI, respectively. It suggested that catechin treated with BLI could be suppressed by AlCl3, while AlCl3 did not form a complex with catechin in the photolytic system. However, under the same conditions, it was also found that the addition of AlCl3 inhibited the photolytic formation of  and reduced the generation of proanthocyanidin, suggesting that the disconnection of proanthocyanidin was achieved by AlCl3 acting as a catalyst under treatment with BLI. The influence of 1 mM fluoride  and 1 mM oxalate  ions on the photolysis of 1 mM catechin upon the addition of 1 mM AlCl3 and treatment with BLI was found to be insignificant, implying that, during the photolysis of catechin, the Al species were either neutral or negatively charged and the aluminum species did not form a complex with anions in the photolytic system. Therefore, aluminum, which is an amphoteric species, has an inherent potential to stabilize the photolysis of catechin in an alkaline conditions, while suppressing the  and proanthocyanidin generation via aluminum ion catalysis in the catechin/Al system under treatment with BLI.
33353215/The Effect of Deuteration on the H2 Receptor Histamine Binding Profile: A Computational Insight into Modified Hydrogen Bonding Interactions We used a range of computational techniques to reveal an increased histamine affinity for its H2 receptor upon deuteration, which was interpreted through altered hydrogen bonding interactions within the receptor and the aqueous environment preceding the binding. Molecular docking identified the area between third and fifth transmembrane alpha-helices as the likely binding pocket for several histamine poses, with the most favorable binding energy of -7.4 kcal mol-1 closely matching the experimental value of -5.9 kcal mol-1. The subsequent molecular dynamics simulation and MM-GBSA analysis recognized Asp98 as the most dominant residue, accounting for 40% of the total binding energy, established through a persistent hydrogen bonding with the histamine -NH3+ group, the latter further held in place through the N-H   O hydrogen bonding with Tyr250. Unlike earlier literature proposals, the important role of Thr190 is not evident in hydrogen bonds through its -OH group, but rather in the C-H   pi contacts with the imidazole ring, while its former moiety is constantly engaged in the hydrogen bonding with Asp186. Lastly, quantum-chemical calculations within the receptor cluster model and utilizing the empirical quantization of the ionizable X-H bonds (X = N, O, S), supported the deuteration-induced affinity increase, with the calculated difference in the binding free energy of -0.85 kcal mol-1, being in excellent agreement with an experimental value of -0.75 kcal mol-1, thus confirming the relevance of hydrogen bonding for the H2 receptor activation.
33353184/In Vitro Antifungal Activity and Mechanism of Ag3PW12O40 Composites against Candida Species Fungal infections pose a serious threat to human health. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are metal-oxygen clusters with potential application in the control of microbial infections. Herein, the Ag3PW12O40 composites have been synthesized and verified by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The antifungal activities of Ag3PW12O40 were screened in 19 Candida species strains through the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by the microdilution checkerboard technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) values of Ag3PW12O40 are 2~32 mug/mL to the Candida species. The MIC80 value of Ag3PW12O40 to resistant clinical isolates C. albicans HL963 is 8 mug/mL, which is lower than the positive control, fluconazole (FLC). The mechanism against C. albicans HL963 results show that Ag3PW12O40 can decrease the ergosterol content. The expressions of ERG1, ERG7, and ERG11, which impact on the synthesis of ergosterol, are all prominently upregulated by Ag3PW12O40. It indicates that Ag3PW12O40 is a candidate in the development of new antifungal agents.
33348539/Cellulose Dissolution in Mixtures of Ionic Liquids and Dimethyl Sulfoxide: A Quantitative Assessment of the Relative Importance of Temperature and Composition of the Binary Solvent We studied the dissolution of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in binary mixtures of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the ionic liquids: allylbenzyldimethylammonium acetate; 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium acetate; 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0]undec-7-ene-8-ium acetate; tetramethylguanidinium acetate. Using chemometrics, we determined the dependence of the mass fraction (in %) of dissolved cellulose (MCC-m%) on the temperature, T = 40, 60, and 80  C, and the mole fraction of DMSO, chiDMSO = 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. We derived equations that quantified the dependence of MCC-m% on T and chiDMSO. Cellulose dissolution increased as a function of increasing both variables; the contribution of chiDMSO was larger than that of T in some cases. Solvent empirical polarity was qualitatively employed to rationalize the cellulose dissolution efficiency of the solvent. Using the solvatochromic probe 2,6-dichloro-4-(2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium-1-yl)phenolate (WB), we calculated the empirical polarity ET(WB) of cellobiose (a model for MCC) in ionic liquid (IL)-DMSO mixtures. The ET(WB) correlated perfectly with T (fixed chiDMSO) and with chiDMSO (fixed T). These results show that there is ground for using medium empirical polarity to assess cellulose dissolution efficiency. We calculated values of MCC-m% under conditions other than those employed to generate the statistical model and determined the corresponding MCC-m% experimentally. The excellent agreement between both values shows the robustness of the statistical model and the usefulness of our approach to predict cellulose dissolution, thus saving time, labor, and material. 
33339290/Chitin and Chitosan Derivatives as Biomaterial Resources for Biological and Biomedical Applications Chitin is a long-chain polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamine, which is regularly found in the exoskeleton of arthropods including insects, shellfish and the cell wall of fungi. It has been known that chitin can be used for biological and biomedical applications, especially as a biomaterial for tissue repairing, encapsulating drug for drug delivery. However, chitin has been postulated as an inducer of proinflammatory cytokines and certain diseases including asthma. Likewise, chitosan, a long-chain polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamine and d-glucosamine derived from chitin deacetylation, and chitosan oligosaccharide, a short chain polymer, have been known for their potential therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiarrheal, and anti-Alzheimer effects. This review summarizes potential utilization and limitation of chitin, chitosan and chitosan oligosaccharide in a variety of diseases. Furthermore, future direction of research and development of chitin, chitosan, and chitosan oligosaccharide for biomedical applications is discussed.
33353187/Adsorption Characteristics of Activated Carbon for the Reclamation of Eosin Y and Indigo Carmine Colored Effluents and New Isotherm Model The adsorption response of eosin Y and indigo carmine acid dyes on activated carbon as a function of system temperature for a fixed concentration was investigated at various temperatures via adsorption isotherms and their thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy changes. The adsorption data were exploited to develop a new adsorption isotherm. The new isotherm was developed with the spirit of solid-liquid phase equilibrium and regular solution theory. The proposed model has four adjustable constants and correlates adsorption isotherm in terms of the system temperature and melting temperature of the dye. The effect of pH on the removal of acid dyes was reported. The pH variation was observed to affect the adsorption efficiency. The removal of eosin Y and indigo carmine decreased from 99.4% to 82.6% and 92.38% to 79.48%, respectively, when the pH of the solution varied from 2 to 12. The thermodynamic analysis of the process reveals that the process of the removal of acid dyes is exothermic and spontaneous. Moreover, the kinetics parameters of the batch process are reported.
33348600/Scientific Evidence Supporting the Beneficial Effects of Isoflavones on Human Health Isoflavones are phenolic compounds with a chemical structure similar to that of estradiol. They are present in several vegetables, mainly in legumes such as soy, white and red clover, alfalfa and beans. The most significant food source of isoflavones in humans is soy-derived products. Isoflavones could be used as an alternative therapy for pathologies dependent on hormonal disorders such as breast and prostate cancer, cardiovascular diseases, as well as to minimize menopausal symptoms. According to the results gathered in the present review, it can be stated that there is scientific evidence showing the beneficial effect of isoflavones on bone health and thus in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis on postmenopausal women, although the results do not seem entirely conclusive as there are discrepancies among the studies, probably related to their experimental designs. For this reason, the results should be interpreted with caution, and more randomized clinical trials are required. By contrast, it seems that soy isoflavones do not lead to a meaningful protective effect on cardiovascular risk. Regarding cancer, scientific evidence suggests that isoflavones could be useful in reducing the risk of suffering some types of cancer, such as breast and endometrial cancer, but further studies are needed to confirm these results. Finally, isoflavones could be useful in reducing hot flushes associated with menopause. However, a limitation in this field is that there is still a great heterogeneity among studies. Lastly, with regard to isoflavone consumption safety, it seems that they are safe and that the most common adverse effect is mild and occurs at the gastrointestinal level.
33339310/Toxicological Screening of Four Bioactive Citroflavonoids: In Vitro, In Vivo, and In Silico Approaches Many studies describe different pharmacological effects of flavonoids on experimental animals and humans. Nevertheless, few ones are confirming the safety of these compounds for therapeutic purposes. This study aimed to investigate the preclinical safety of naringenin, naringin, hesperidin, and quercetin by in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches. For this, an MTT-based cytotoxicity assay in VERO and MDCK cell lines was performed. In addition, acute toxicity was evaluated on Wistar rats by OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals (Test No. 423: Acute Oral Toxicity-Class Method). Furthermore, we used the ACD/Tox Suite to predict toxicological parameters such as hERG channel blockade, CYP450 inhibition, and acute toxicity in animals. The results showed that quercetin was slightly more cytotoxic on cell lines (IC50 of 219.44 +- 7.22 mM and 465.41 +- 7.44 mM, respectively) than the other citroflavonoids. All flavonoids exhibited an LD50 value > 2000 mg/kg, which classifies them as low-risk substances as OECD guidelines established. Similarly, predicted LD50 was LD50 > 300 to 2000 mg/kg for all flavonoids as acute toxicity assay estimated. Data suggests that all these flavonoids did not show significant toxicological effects, and they were classified as low-risk, useful substances for drug development.
33348597/Role of Copper Oxide on Epoxy Coatings with New Intumescent Polymer-Based Fire Retardant Epoxy resins (EP) have been used as a thermos-setting material in the field of coating, casting, bonding agent, and laminating. However, a major drawback associated with its use is the lack of good flaming properties, and it is responsible for heavy smoke along with hazardous gases considerably limiting its uses in various fields. In this study, N-ethanolamine triazine-piperizine, a melamine polymer (ETPMP), was established as a new charring-foaming agent and was successfully synthesized with ethanolamine, piperizine, cyanuric chloride, and melamine as precursor molecules via the nucleophilic substitution reaction method. Elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis were applied to approve the synthesis of ETPMP and confirmation of its structure and characterization. The epoxy coating of intumescent flame retardant (IFR) was equipped by introducing ETPMP, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and copper oxide (CuO) in multiple composition ratios. CuO was loaded at various amounts into the IFR-coating system as a synergistic agent. The synergistic action of CuO on IFR coatings was scientifically examined by using different analytical tests such as vertical burning test (UL-94V), limited oxygen index (LOI), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), cone calorimeter, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed that small changes in the amount of CuO expressively amplified the LOI results and enhanced the V-0 ratings in the UL-94V test. The TGA data clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of CuO can transform the thermal deprivation behavior of coatings with a growing char slag proportion with elevated temperatures. Information from cone calorimeter data affirmed that CuO can decrease the burning factors by total heat release (THR) together with peak heat release rate (PHRR). The SEM images indicated that CuO can enrich the power and compression of the intumescent char that restricts the movement of heat and oxygen. Our results demonstrate a positive influence of CuO on the epoxy-headed intumescent flame retardant coatings.
33339257/Furan-Conjugated Tripeptides as Potent Antitumor Drugs Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of death in women. Chemotherapy options available for cervical cancer include highly cytotoxic drugs such as taxol, cisplatin, 5-florouracil, and doxorubicin, which are not specific. In the current study, we have identified a new peptide conjugate (Fur4-2-Nal3-Ala2-Phe1-CONH2) (conjugate 4), from screening of a small library of tripeptide-conjugates of furan, as highly potent anticancer compound against human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells) (IC50 = 0.15 +- 0.05 microg/mL or 0.28 +/- 0.09 microM). Peptides were constructed on Rink amide resin from C- to N-terminus followed by capping by alpha-furoic acid moiety. The synthesized peptides were purified by recycling RP-HPLC, and structures of all the peptides were confirmed by using FABMS/ESIMS, 1H- NMR, 13C-NMR, and HR-FABMS. Conjugate 4 was furthermore found to be specifically active against human cervical cancer cells since it did not inhibit the proliferation of other human normal cells (HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and IMR-90 (normal human fibroblasts)), and cancer cells tested (HUVEC, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells), as well as in mice 3T3 cells (normal fibroblasts). This study revealed a good structure activity relationship of various peptide conjugates. Conjugate 4 in branched forms (4a and 4b) were also synthesized and evaluated against HeLa cells, and results revealed that both were inactive. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies and staining with rhodamine 123 and propidium iodide (PI) revealed that conjugate 4 possesses a membranolytic effect and causes the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
33348818/Comparative Evaluation of Intestinal Absorption and Functional Value of Iron Dietary Supplements and Drug with Different Delivery Systems Iron is a fundament micronutrient, whose homeostasis is strictly regulated. Iron deficiency anemia is among the most widespread nutritional deficiencies and its therapy, based on dietary supplement and drugs, may lead to severe side effects. With the aim of improving iron bioavailability while reducing iron oral therapy side effects, novel dietary supplements based on innovative technologies:microencapsulation, liposomes, sucrosomes:have been produced and marketed. In the present work, six iron dietary supplements for different therapeutic targets were compared in terms of bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and safety by using an integrated in vitro approach. For general-purpose iron supplements, ME + VitC (microencapsulated) showed a fast, burst intestinal iron absorption kinetic, which maintained iron bioavailability and ferritin expression constant over time. SS + VitC (sucrosomes), on the other side, showed a slower, time-dependent iron absorption and ferritin expression trend. ME + Folate (microencapsulated) showed a behavior similar to that of ME + VitC, albeit with a lower bioavailability. Among pediatric iron supplements, a time-dependent bioavailability increase was observed for LS (liposome), while PIC (polydextrose-iron complex) bioavailability is severely limited by its poor bioaccessibility. Finally, except for SS + VitC, no adverse effects on intestinal mucosa vitality and barrier integrity were observed. Considering obtained results and the different therapeutic targets, microencapsulation-based formulations are endowed with better performance compared to the other formulations. Furthermore, performances of microencapsulated products were obtained with a lower iron daily dose, limiting the potential onset of side effects.
33353018/Evaluating the Effects of Grain of Isogenic Wheat Lines Differing in the Content of Anthocyanins in Mouse Models of Neurodegenerative Disorders Functional foods enriched with plant polyphenols and anthocyanins in particular attract special attention due to multiple beneficial bioactive properties of the latter. We evaluated the effects of a grain diet rich in anthocyanins in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) with overexpression of human alpha-synuclein. The mice were kept at a diet that consisted of the wheat grain of near isogenic lines differing in anthocyanin content for five-six months. The anthocyanin-rich diet was safe and possessed positive effects on cognitive function. Anthocyanins prevented deficits in working memory induced by Abeta or a long-term grain mono-diet; they partially reversed episodic memory alterations. Both types of grain diets prolonged memory extinction and rescued its facilitation in the PD model. The dynamics of the extinction in the group fed with the anthocyanin-rich wheat was closer to that in a group of wild-type mice given standard chow. The anthocyanin-rich diet reduced alpha-synuclein accumulation and modulated microglial response in the brain of the transgenic mice including the elevated expression of arginase1 that marks M2 microglia. Thus, anthocyanin-rich wheat is suggested as a promising source of functional nutrition at the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders.
33339433/Preparation, Spectroscopic Characterization, Theoretical Investigations, and In Vitro Anticancer Activity of Cd(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II) Complexes of 4(3H)-Quinazolinone-Derived Schiff Base Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new Schiff base ligand 3-[[(E)-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-methylidene]amino]-2-methyl-quinazolin-4(3H)-one (HAMQ) and its Cd(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II) complexes (C1-C4). The ligand HAMQ was synthesized by reacting 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3-amino-2-methyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone in a 1:1 molar ratio. The structure of the ligand and its complexes (C1-C4) were evaluated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) light spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, MS, elemental analysis, conductance data, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The characterization results suggested that the bidentate ligand, HAMQ, coordinated to the metal center through the lactum oxygen and the azomethine nitrogen. Moreover, all the metal complexes were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that all of them belong to a triclinic crystal system. The research was supplemented by density functional theory (DFT) studies on the IR and UV-Vis spectra, as well as the chemical reactivity of the HAMQ and its four metallic derivatives making use of conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) by means of KID (Koopmans in DFT) methodology. The synthesized complexes displayed significant in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines (HeLa and HCT-115).
33353010/Role of Ferrous Sulfate (FeSO4) in Resistance to Cadmium Stress in Two Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Genotypes The impact of heavy metal, i.e., cadmium (Cd), on the growth, photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange characteristics, oxidative stress biomarkers, and antioxidants machinery (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants), ions uptake, organic acids exudation, and ultra-structure of membranous bounded organelles of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes (Shan 63 and Lu 9803) were investigated with and without the exogenous application of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4). Two O. sativa genotypes were grown under different levels of CdCl2 [0 (no Cd), 50 and 100 microM] and then treated with exogenously supplemented ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) [0 (no Fe), 50 and 100 microM] for 21 days. The results revealed that Cd stress significantly (p < 0.05) affected plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange characteristics, affected antioxidant machinery, sugar contents, and ions uptake/accumulation, and destroy the ultra-structure of many membranous bounded organelles. The findings also showed that Cd toxicity induces oxidative stress biomarkers, i.e., malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) initiation, and electrolyte leakage (%), which was also manifested by increasing the enzymatic antioxidants, i.e., superoxidase dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds (phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanin) and organic acids exudation pattern in both O. sativa genotypes. At the same time, the results also elucidated that the O. sativa genotypes Lu 9803 are more tolerant to Cd stress than Shan 63. Although, results also illustrated that the exogenous application of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) also decreased Cd toxicity in both O. sativa genotypes by increasing antioxidant capacity and thus improved the plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange characteristics, and decrease oxidative stress in the roots and shoots of O. sativa genotypes. Here, we conclude that the exogenous supplementation of FeSO4 under short-term exposure of Cd stress significantly improved plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange characteristics, regulate antioxidant defense system, and essential nutrients uptake and maintained the ultra-structure of membranous bounded organelles in O. sativa genotypes.
33348842/Efficient Synthesis of New Fluorinated beta-Amino Acid Enantiomers through Lipase-Catalyzed Hydrolysis An efficient and novel enzymatic method has been developed for the synthesis of beta-fluorophenyl-substituted beta-amino acid enantiomers through lipase PSIM (Burkholderia cepasia) catalyzed hydrolysis of racemic beta-amino carboxylic ester hydrochloride salts 3a-e in iPr2O at 45  C in the presence of Et3N and H2O. Adequate analytical methods were developed for the enantio-separation of racemic beta-amino carboxylic ester hydrochlorides 3a-e and beta-amino acids 2a-e. Preparative-scale resolutions furnished unreacted amino esters (R)-4a-e and product amino acids (S)-5a-e with excellent ee values (>=99%) and good chemical yields (>48%).
33352838/Preclinical Evaluation of the Copper-64 Labeled GRPR-Antagonist RM26 in Comparison with the Cobalt-55 Labeled Counterpart for PET-Imaging of Prostate Cancer Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is overexpressed in the majority of prostate cancers. This study aimed to investigate the potential of 64Cu (radionuclide for late time-point PET-imaging) for imaging of GRPR expression using NOTA-PEG2-RM26 and NODAGA-PEG2-RM26. Methods: NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 were labeled with 64Cu and evaluated in GRPR-expressing PC-3 cells. Biodistribution of [64Cu]Cu-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 was studied in PC-3 xenografted mice and compared to the biodistribution of [57Co]Co-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 at 3 and 24 h p.i. Preclinical PET/CT imaging was performed in tumor-bearing mice. NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 were stably labeled with 64Cu with quantitative yields. In vitro, binding of [64Cu]Cu-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 was rapid and GRPR-specific with slow internalization. In vivo, [64Cu]Cu-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 bound specifically to GRPR-expressing tumors with fast clearance from blood and normal organs and displayed generally comparable biodistribution profiles to [57Co]Co-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26; tumor uptake exceeded normal tissue uptake 3 h p.i.. Tumor-to-organ ratios did not increase significantly with time. [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 had a significantly higher liver and pancreas uptake compared to other agents. 57Co-labeled radioconjugates showed overall higher tumor-to-non-tumor ratios, compared to the 64Cu-labeled counterparts. [64Cu]Cu-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 was able to visualize GRPR-expression in a murine PC model using PET. However, [55/57Co]Co-NOTA/NODAGA-PEG2-RM26 provided better in vivo stability and overall higher tumor-to-non-tumor ratios compared with the 64Cu-labeled conjugates.
33352986/Synthesis and Influence of 3-Amino Benzoxaboroles Structure on Their Activity against Candida albicans Benzoxaboroles emerged recently as molecules of high medicinal potential with Kerydin  (Tavaborole) and Eucrisa  (Crisaborole) currently in clinical practice as antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively. Over a dozen of 3-amino benzoxaboroles, including Tavaborole's derivatives, have been synthetized and characterized in terms of their activity against Candida albicans as a model pathogenic fungus. The studied compounds broaden considerably the structural diversity of reported benzoxaboroles, enabling determination of the influence of the introduction of a heterocyclic amine, a fluorine substituent as well as the formyl group on antifungal activity of those compounds. The determined zones of the growth inhibition of examined microorganism indicate high diffusion of majority of the studied compounds within the applied media as well as their reasonable activity. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values show that the introduction of an amine substituent in position "3" of the benzoxaborole heterocyclic ring results in a considerable drop in activity in comparison with Tavaborole (AN2690) as well as unsubstituted benzoxaborole (AN2679). In all studied cases the presence of a fluorine substituent at position para to the boron atom results in lower MIC values (higher activity). Interestingly, introduction of a fluorine substituent in the more distant piperazine phenyl ring does not influence MIC values. As determined by X-ray studies, introduction of a formyl group in proximity of the boron atom results in a considerable change of the boronic group geometry. The presence of a formyl group next to the benzoxaborole unit is also detrimental for activity against Candida albicans.
33348828/Quaternary Ammonium-Based Ionosilica Hydrogels as Draw Solutes in Forward Osmosis In the last few years, forward osmosis (FO) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable technique for water desalination and wastewater treatment. However, FO remains as an immature process principally due to the lack of efficient and easily recyclable draw solutes. In this work, we report that ionosilica hydrogels based on quaternary ammonium halide ionosilica are efficient draw solutes in FO. Fluidic ionosilica hydrogels were obtained via hydrolysis-polycondensation reactions of a trisilylated quaternary ammonium precursor in slightly acidic water/ethanol solvent mixtures. The liquid-to-gel transition of the precursor and the kinetics of the formation of hydrogels were monitored by liquid NMR measurements. The formed hydrogels were shown to generate osmotic pressure up to 10.0 atm, indicating the potential of these hydrogels as efficient draw solutes in FO. Our results suggest that iodide anions are the osmotically active species in the system. Regeneration of the hydrogels via ultrafiltration (UF) was successfully achieved, allowing the development of a closed FO-UF process. However, the osmotic performances of the ionosilica hydrogels irreversibly decreased along the successive FO-UF cycles, probably due to anion exchange processes.
33352999/Pyrrolidinium Containing Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Li-Based Batteries Ionic liquids are potential alternative electrolytes to the more conventional solid-state options under investigation for future energy storage solutions. This review addresses the utilization of IL electrolytes in energy storage devices, particularly pyrrolidinium-based ILs. These ILs offer favorable properties, such as high ionic conductivity and the potential for high power drain, low volatility and wide electrochemical stability windows (ESW). The cation/anion combination utilized significantly influences their physical and electrochemical properties, therefore a thorough discussion of different combinations is outlined. Compatibility with a wide array of cathode and anode materials such as LFP, V2O5, Ge and Sn is exhibited, whereby thin-films and nanostructured materials are investigated for micro energy applications. Polymer gel electrolytes suitable for layer-by-layer fabrication are discussed for the various pyrrolidinium cations, and their compatibility with electrode materials assessed. Recent advancements regarding the modification of typical cations such a 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium, to produce ether-functionalized or symmetrical cations is discussed.
33353041/Ten SNPs May Affect Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Interaction with Prenatal Exposure to Chinese Famine Increasing studies have demonstrated that gene and famine may interact on type 2 diabetes risk. The data derived from the cross-sectional 2010-2012 China National Nutrition and Health Survey (CNNHS) was examined to explore whether gene and famine interacted to influence type 2 diabetes risk. In total, 2216 subjects were involved. The subjects born in 1960 and 1961 were selected as the famine-exposed group, whereas subjects born in 1963 were selected as the unexposed group. A Mass Array system was used to detect the genotypes of 50 related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Interactions were found between prenatal exposure to famine and ten SNPs (rs10401969, rs10886471, rs10946398, rs1470579, rs2796441, rs340874, rs3794991, rs5015480, rs7961581, and rs9470794) on type 2 diabetes risk after adjustments. The stratified results showed that famine exposure exacerbated the effect of CILP2-rs10401969 to fasting serum insulin (FINS), GRK5-rs10886471 to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and FINS, IGF2BP2-rs1470579 to FINS, TLE1-rs2796441 to impaired fasting glucose (IFG), PROX1-rs340874 to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), GATAD2A-rs3794991 to FINS, TSPAN8/LGR5-rs7961581 to FPG, and ZFAND3-rs9470794 to IGT and FINS. Famine exposure weakened the effect of CDKAL1-rs10946398 to type 2 diabetes. Famine exposure weakened the effect of HHEX-rs5015480 to IFG, but exacerbated the effect of HHEX-rs5015480 to FINS. The present study suggests that ten SNPs may affect type 2 diabetes risk in interaction with prenatal exposure to Chinese famine.
33348621/Milk Containing A2 beta-Casein ONLY, as a Single Meal, Causes Fewer Symptoms of Lactose Intolerance than Milk Containing A1 and A2 beta-Caseins in Subjects with Lactose Maldigestion and Intolerance: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Trial Acute-feeding and multiple-day studies have demonstrated that milk containing A2 beta-casein only causes fewer symptoms of lactose intolerance (LI) than milk containing both A1 and A2 beta-caseins. We conducted a single-meal study to evaluate the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance of milk containing different concentrations of A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in 25 LI subjects with maldigestion and an additional eight lactose maldigesters who did not meet the QLCSS criteria. Subjects received each of four types of milk (milk containing A2 beta-casein protein only, Jersey milk, conventional milk, and lactose-free milk) after overnight fasting. Symptoms of GI intolerance and breath hydrogen concentrations were analyzed for 6 h after ingestion of each type of milk. In an analysis of the 25 LI subjects, total symptom score for abdominal pain was lower following consumption of milk containing A2 beta-casein only, compared with conventional milk (p = 0.004). Post hoc analysis with lactose maldigesters revealed statistically significantly improved symptom scores (p = 0.04) and lower hydrogen production (p = 0.04) following consumption of milk containing A2 beta-casein only compared with conventional milk. Consumption of milk containing A2 beta-casein only is associated with fewer GI symptoms than consumption of conventional milk in lactose maldigesters.
33348748/Determination of Major Endogenous FAHFAs in Healthy Human Circulation: The Correlations with Several Circulating Cardiovascular-Related Biomarkers and Anti-Inflammatory Effects on RAW 264.7 Cells Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are newly discovered long-chain fatty acids. However, the major endogenous FAHFAs in healthy human circulation, their correlation with cardiovascular (CV) biomarkers, and their anti-inflammatory effects have not been investigated and remain unclear. In the present study, a total of 57 healthy subjects were recruited. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of seven FAHFAs, four long-chain fatty acids, and four non-traditional circulating CV-related biomarkers. We found two major types of FAHFAs in healthy human circulation, palmitoleic acid ester of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-POHSA), and oleic acid ester of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-OAHSA). Both 9-POHSA and 9-OAHSA had a strong positive correlation with each other and were negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), but not with l-homocysteine. 9-POHSA was also positively correlated with l-carnitine. Moreover, we confirmed that both 9-POHSA and 9-OAHSA exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing LPS stimulated cytokines, including IL-1beta and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, palmitoleic acid also had a positive correlation with 9-POHSA and 9-OAHSA. As far as we know, this is the first report showing the major endogenous FAHFAs in healthy subjects and their CV protection potential which might be correlated with SAH and TMAO reduction, l-Carnitine elevation, and their anti-inflammatory effects.
33353172/The First Nickelacarborane with closo-nido Structure The first nickelacarborane with closo-nido structure [10',11'-(Py)2-3,9'-Ni(1,2-C2B9H11)(7',8'-C2B8H8)] was isolated from the reaction of nickel(IV) bis(dicarbollide) with pyridine. The molecular structure of this complex was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The nickel atom is a common vertex for the closo-NiC2B9 cluster and the nido-NC2B8 cluster where it is located together with carbon atoms in the open NiC2B2 pentagonal face. It is assumed that its formation proceeds through the nucleophile-induced removal of the B(6)H vertex followed by rearrangement of the forming 11-vertex cluster, which most likely proceeds through a sequence of closing and opening reactions.
33339375/Metabolic Profile of Scytalidium parasiticum-Ganoderma boninense Co-Cultures Revealed the Alkaloids, Flavonoids and Fatty Acids that Contribute to Anti-Ganoderma Activity In solving the issue of basal stem rot diseases caused by Ganoderma, an investigation of Scytalidium parasiticum as a biological control agent that suppresses Ganoderma infection has gained our interest, as it is more environmentally friendly. Recently, the fungal co-cultivation has emerged as a promising method to discover novel antimicrobial metabolites. In this study, an established technique of co-culturing Scytalidium parasiticum and Ganoderma boninense was applied to produce and induce metabolites that have antifungal activity against G. boninense. The crude extract from the co-culture media was applied to a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) preparative column to isolate the bioactive compounds, which were tested against G. boninense. The fractions that showed inhibition against G. boninense were sent for a Liquid Chromatography-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) analysis to further identify the compounds that were responsible for the microbicidal activity. Interestingly, we found that eudistomin I, naringenin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside and penipanoid A, which were present in different abundances in all the active fractions, except in the control, could be the antimicrobial metabolites. In addition, the abundance of fatty acids, such as oleic acid and stearamide in the active fraction, also enhanced the antimicrobial activity. This comprehensive metabolomics study could be used as the basis for isolating biocontrol compounds to be applied in oil palm fields to combat a Ganoderma infection.
33348772/Acrylamide-Hemoglobin Adduct Levels in a Japanese Population and Comparison with Acrylamide Exposure Assessed by the Duplicated Method or a Food Frequency Questionnaire The levels of hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide (AA-Hb), a biomarker of acrylamide exposure, have not been reported for Japanese subjects. Herein, we determined the AA-Hb levels in a Japanese population and compared them with the estimated dietary intake from the duplicate diet method (DM) and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). One-day DM samples, FFQ, and blood samples were collected from 89 participants and analyzed for acrylamide. AA-Hb was analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and the N-alkyl Edman method. Participants were divided into tertiles of estimated acrylamide intake and geometric means (GMs) of AA-Hb adjusted for sex and smoking status. A stratified analysis according to smoking status was also performed. The average AA-Hb levels for all participants, never, past, and current smokers were 46, 38, 65, and 86 pmol/g Hb, respectively. GMs of AA-Hb levels in all participants were significantly associated with tertiles of estimated acrylamide intake from DM (p for trend = 0.02) and FFQ (p for trend = 0.04), although no association with smokers was observed. AA-Hb levels reflected smoking status, which were similar to values reported in Western populations, and they were associated with estimated dietary intake of acrylamide when adjusted for sex and smoking status.
33348838/A Compressive Review about Taxol : History and Future Challenges Taxol , which is also known as paclitaxel, is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used to treat different cancers. Since the discovery of its antitumoral activity, Taxol  has been used to treat over one million patients, making it one of the most widely employed antitumoral drugs. Taxol  was the first microtubule targeting agent described in the literature, with its main mechanism of action consisting of the disruption of microtubule dynamics, thus inducing mitotic arrest and cell death. However, secondary mechanisms for achieving apoptosis have also been demonstrated. Despite its wide use, Taxol  has certain disadvantages. The main challenges facing Taxol  are the need to find an environmentally sustainable production method based on the use of microorganisms, increase its bioavailability without exerting adverse effects on the health of patients and minimize the resistance presented by a high percentage of cells treated with paclitaxel. This review details, in a succinct manner, the main aspects of this important drug, from its discovery to the present day. We highlight the main challenges that must be faced in the coming years, in order to increase the effectiveness of Taxol  as an anticancer agent.
33353230/Effects of Caffeine and Chlorogenic Acid on Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice Induced by Choline-Deficient, L-Amino Acid-Defined, High-Fat Diet Several recent experimental studies have investigated the effects of caffeine and chlorogenic acid (CGA), representative ingredients of coffee, on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the results are conflicting, and their effects are yet to be clarified. In the present study, we examined the effects of caffeine and CGA on choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD)-fed mice, relatively new model mice of NASH. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into the following groups: Control diet (control), CDAHFD (CDAHFD), CDAHFD supplemented with 0.05% (w/w) caffeine (caffeine), and CDAHFD supplemented with 0.1% (w/w) CGA (CGA). After seven weeks, the mice were killed and serum biochemical, histopathological, and molecular analyses were performed. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly higher in the caffeine and CGA groups than in the CDAHFD group. On image analysis, the prevalence of Oil red O-positive areas (reflecting steatosis) was significantly higher in the caffeine group than in the CDAHFD group, and that of CD45R-positive areas (reflecting lymphocytic infiltration) in the hepatic lobule was significantly higher in the caffeine and CGA groups than in the CDAHFD group. Hepatic expression of interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA was higher in the caffeine and CGA groups than in the CDAHFD group, and the difference was statistically significant for the caffeine group. In conclusion, in the present study, caffeine and CGA significantly worsened the markers of liver cell injury, inflammation, and/or steatosis in NASH lesions in mice.
33348914/Towards Iron(II) Complexes with Octahedral Geometry: Synthesis, Structure and Photophysical Properties The control of ligand-field splitting in iron (II) complexes is critical to slow down the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)-excited states deactivation pathways. The gap between the metal-centered states is maximal when the coordination sphere of the complex approaches an ideal octahedral geometry. Two new iron(II) complexes (C1 and C2), prepared from pyridylNHC and pyridylquinoline type ligands, respectively, have a near-perfect octahedral coordination of the metal. The photophysics of the complexes have been further investigated by means of ultrafast spectroscopy and TD-DFT modeling. For C1, it is shown that:despite the geometrical improvement:the excited state deactivation is faster than for the parent pseudo-octahedral C0 complex. This unexpected result is due to the increased ligand flexibility in C1 that lowers the energetic barrier for the relaxation of 3MLCT into the 3MC state. For C2, the effect of the increased ligand field is not strong enough to close the prominent deactivation channel into the metal-centered quintet state, as for other Fe-polypyridine complexes.
33348622/The Influence of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide on Graham Flour Enzyme Polyphenol Oxidase Activity Graham flour is a form of whole wheat flour made by grinding the endosperm and is thus also the most nutritious. Generally, the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzes two different reactions in the presence of molecular oxygen: the hydroxylation of monophenols to ortho-diphenol and the oxidation of o-diphenol to o-quinone. The purpose of the work was to inactivate PPO activity to extend the shelf life of graham flour and at the same time preserve all the of its high-quality properties. The influence of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) treatment on PPO activity in graham flour was investigated. First, graham flour was exposed to scCO2 conditions, then the proteins were extracted, and in the last step the concentration of total proteins and the specific activity of the PPO enzyme were determined by spectrophotometric assay. PPO activity decreased with an increase in treatment pressure. Furthermore, the flour quality characteristics that meet all needs for wheat end-use products after scCO2 treatment have been preserved. No major changes in the structure of the granulate or shape of the flour particles were observed. A slightly reduced value of the moisture content in scCO2-treated graham flour also implies an extension of the shelf life.
33352890/Evaluation of Vitamin D Metabolism in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in the Setting of Cholecalciferol Treatment In this prospective controlled study, we examined 25 adults with adequately controlled (HbA1c level < 8.0%) type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 49 conditionally healthy adults, intending to reveal the diversity of vitamin D metabolism in the setting of cholecalciferol intake at a therapeutic dose. All patients received a single dose (150,000 IU) of cholecalciferol aqueous solution orally. Laboratory assessments including serum vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3), free 25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as serum and urine biochemical parameters were performed before the intake and on Days 1, 3 and 7 after the administration. The studied groups had no significant differences in baseline parameters except that the patients with diabetes showed higher baseline levels of free 25(OH)D (p < 0.05). They also lacked a correlation between the measured and calculated free 25(OH)D in contrast to the patients from the control group (r = 0.41, p > 0.05 vs. r = 0.88, p < 0.05), possibly due to the glycosylation of binding proteins, which affects the affinity constant for 25(OH)D. The elevation of vitamin D levels after the administration of cholecalciferol was comparable in both groups, with slightly higher 25(OH)D3 levels observed in the diabetes group throughout the study since Day 1 (p < 0.05). Overall, our data indicate that in patients with adequately controlled T1DM 25(OH)D3 levels and the therapeutic response to cholecalciferol is similar to that in healthy individuals.
33339401/Docking Prediction, Antifungal Activity, Anti-Biofilm Effects on Candida spp., and Toxicity against Human Cells of Cinnamaldehyde Objective: This study evaluated the antifungal activity of cinnamaldehyde on Candida spp. In vitro and in situ assays were carried out to test cinnamaldehyde for its anti-Candida effects, antibiofilm activity, effects on fungal micromorphology, antioxidant activity, and toxicity on keratinocytes and human erythrocytes. Statistical analysis was performed considering alpha = 5%. Results: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of cinnamaldehyde ranged from 18.91 muM to 37.83 muM. MIC values did not change in the presence of 0.8 M sorbitol, whereas an 8-fold increase was observed in the presence of ergosterol, suggesting that cinnamaldehyde may act on the cell membrane, which was subsequently confirmed by docking analysis. The action of cinnamaldehyde likely includes binding to enzymes involved in the formation of the cytoplasmic membrane in yeast cells. Cinnamaldehyde-treated microcultures showed impaired cellular development, with an expression of rare pseudo-hyphae and absence of chlamydoconidia. Cinnamaldehyde reduced biofilm adherence by 64.52% to 33.75% (p < 0.0001) at low concentrations (378.3-151.3 microM). Cinnamaldehyde did not show antioxidant properties. Conclusions: Cinnamaldehyde showed fungicidal activity through a mechanism of action likely related to ergosterol complexation; it was non-cytotoxic to keratinocytes and human erythrocytes and showed no antioxidant activity.
33339233/Structural Studies of the Cutin from Two Apple Varieties: Golden Delicious and Red Delicious (Malus domestica) The cuticle, a protective cuticular barrier present in almost all primary aerial plant organs, has a composition that varies between plant species. As a part of the apple peel, cuticle and epicuticular waxes have an important role in the skin appearance and quality characteristic in fresh fruits destined for human consumption. The specific composition and structural characteristics of cutin from two apple varieties, "golden delicious" and "red delicious", were obtained by enzymatic protocols and studied by means of cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS 13C NMR), attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and mass spectrometry, and were morphologically characterized by specialized microscopy techniques (atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLMS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)). According to CP-MAS 13C NMR and ATR-FTIR analysis, cutins from both varieties are mainly composed of aliphatics and a small difference is shown between them. This was corroborated from the hydrolyzed cutins analysis by mass spectrometry, where 9,10,18-trihydroxy-octadecanoic acid; 10,20-Dihydroxy-icosanoic acid; 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecenoic acid (10,16-DHPA); 9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid; and 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid were the main monomers isolated. The low presence of polysaccharides and phenolics in the cutins obtained could be related to the low elastic behavior of this biocomposite and the presence of cracks in the apple cutin's surface. These cracks have an average depth of 1.57 microm +- 0.57 in the golden apple, and 1.77 microm +- 0.64 in those found in the red apple. The results obtained in this work may facilitate a better understanding that mechanical properties of the apple fruit skin are mainly related to the specific aliphatic composition of cutin and help to much better investigate the formation of microcracks, an important symptom of russet formation.
33322312/In Vitro Evaluation of Pro- and Antioxidant Effects of Flavonoid Tricetin in Comparison to Myricetin Flavonoids are rather common plant phenolic constituents that are known for potent antioxidant effects and can be beneficial for human health. Flavonoids with a pyrogallol moiety are highly efficient reducing agents with possible pro- and antioxidant effects, depending on the reaction milieu. Therefore, the redox properties of myricetin and tricetin were investigated by differential pulse voltammetry and deoxyribose degradation assay. Tricetin proved to be a good antioxidant but only showed negligible pro-oxidant activity in one of the deoxyribose degradation assay variants. Compared to tricetin, myricetin showed pro- and antioxidant effects. The more efficient reducing properties of myricetin are probably caused by the positive mesomeric effect of the enolic 3-hydroxy group on ring C. It is evident that the antioxidant properties of structurally similar flavonoids can be converted to apparent pro-oxidant effects by relatively small structural changes, such as hydroxylation. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) often serve as secondary messengers in pathological and physiological processes in animal and plant cells, the pro- and antioxidant properties of flavonoids are an important part of controlling mechanisms of tissue signal cascades.
33415153/Antibacterial, Anticandidal, Phytochemical, and Biological Evaluations of Pellitory Plant Pellitory plant (Parietaria judaica (PJ)) is one of the most widely used Arabian traditional medicinal plants due to its ability to cure several infectious diseases and other illnesses. The current study is aimed at assessing the phytoconstituents, antilipase, antiamylase, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic characters of the Pellitory plant (Parietaria judaica (PJ)). Phytochemical screening and procyanidin detection were conducted according to the standard phytochemical procedures. Porcine pancreatic lipase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities were carried out using p-nitrophenyl butyrate and dinitrosalicylic acid assays, respectively. In addition, antimicrobial activity was determined utilizing a microdilution assay against several bacterial and fungal strains. Besides, the cytotoxic effect against HeLa cell line was tested employing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. The quantitative test results revealed that the methanol fraction of PJ contains 18.55 +- 0.55 mg of procyanidin and has a potential alpha-amylase inhibitory activity compared with the antidiabetic drug Acarbose with IC50 values of 15.84 +- 2.25 and 28.18 +- 1.22 mug/ml, respectively. Also, it has a potential antilipase activity compared to the commercial antiobesity drug, Orlistat, with IC50 values of 38.9 +- 0.29 and 12.3 +- 0.35 mug/ml, respectively. The acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against the screened bacterial strains, while the acetone fraction has shown anticandidal activity with a MIC value of 0.195 mg/ml. The PJ hexane and acetone fractions decreased HeLa cell viability significantly (p value < 0.0001) by approximately 90% at the concentration of 0.625 mg/ml. The revealed outcomes showed that the methanol fraction has strong alpha-amylase and lipase inhibitory characters. Besides, acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, while the acetone fraction revealed potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans. Moreover, at low concentrations, hexane and acetone fractions have potent cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity against HeLa cancer cells. Nevertheless, PJ acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions can serve as an effective source of natural products to develop new antiobesity, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and anticancer agents.
33415148/Effect of Calomelanone, a Dihydrochalcone Analogue, on Human Cancer Apoptosis/Regulated Cell Death in an In Vitro Model Calomelanone, 2',6'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxydihydrochalcone, possesses anticancer activities. This study was conducted to investigate the cytotoxic effect of calomelanone, a dihydrochalcone analogue, on human cancer cells and its associated mechanisms. The cytotoxic effect of calomelanone was measured by MTT assay. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and DiOC6 staining that employed flow cytometry were used to determine the mode of cell death and reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), respectively. Caspase activities were measured using specific substrates and colorimetric analysis. The expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Reactive oxygen species were also measured using 2',7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium (fluorescence dyes). Calomelanone was found to be toxic towards various human cancer cells, including acute promyelocytic HL-60 and monocytic leukemic U937 cells, in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h and human hepatocellular HepG2 cells at 48 h. However, the proliferation of HepG2 cells increased at 24 h. Calomelanone was found to induce apoptosis in HL-60 and U937 at 24 h and HepG2 apoptosis at 48 h via the intrinsic pathway by inducing MTP disruption. This compound also induced caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities. Calomelanone upregulated proapoptotic Bax and Bak and downregulated antiapoptotic Bcl-xL proteins in HepG2 cells. Moreover, signaling was also associated with oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. Calomelanone induced autophagy at 24 h of treatment, which was evidenced by staining with monodansylcadaverine (MDC) to represent autophagic flux. This was associated with a decrease of Akt (survival pathway) and an upregulation of Atg5 (the marker of autophagy). Thus, calomelanone induced apoptosis/regulated cell death in HL-60, U937, and HepG2 cells. However, it also induced autophagy in HepG2 depending on duration, dose, and type of cells. Thus, calomelanone could be used as a potential anticancer agent for cancer treatment. Nevertheless, acute and chronic toxicity should be further investigated in animals before conducting investigations in human patients.
33415146/Sulforaphane Attenuates Isoproterenol-Induced Myocardial Injury in Mice The development of isoproterenol- (ISO-) induced oxidative stress in the myocardium results in myocardial necrosis. Sulforaphane (SFN-0.4% of sulforaphane from standardized broccoli sprout extract) possesses chemoprotective, antidiabetic, and antibacterial activities and is also active against cardiovascular-related problems due to its antioxidant properties. This study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effect of SFN against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in mice. Healthy male Swiss albino mice weighing 20-30 g were used in this study. These mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6). All the mice in the experimental groups received isoproterenol (5 mg/kg bw, via i.p.) consecutively for 2 days. The mice were treated with SFN (4 mg/kg bw) and alpha-tocopherol (TCF) (10 mg/kg bw) by oral gavage for 1-7 days as pre- and posttreatment for the prophylactic and treatment groups, respectively. On day 10, the following parameters were studied: heart weight to body weight ratio, antioxidant parameters, and cardiac markers; and mitochondrial enzymes were estimated for cardioprotection. Administration of isoproterenol in mice showed an increased level of serum cardiac markers and heart mitochondrial ATPase enzymes. An increased level of myocardial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance and decreased levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes indicated that oxidative stress is induced by isoproterenol in the myocardium. The administration of SFN in mice restored the levels of all biochemical parameters to near-normal levels. Histopathological studies further confirmed the protective effect of sulforaphane. This study concluded that treatment with SFN boosts the endogenous antioxidant activity and prevents isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury.
33414895/Skin-Related Properties and Constituents from the Aerial Parts Extract of Persicaria senticosa In the course of screening for cosmetic ingredients by measuring antioxidant and antiwrinkle and whitening and anti-inflammatory activities, skin-related activity was tested using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, elastase inhibition, tyrosinase inhibition, and nitric oxide assay. Several Polygonaseae extracts were found to show potent activity. The results showed that the Persicaria senticosa methanolic extract has the 1,1diphenyl-2picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ABTS radical scavenging activities (IC50 61.0 and 17.5 mug/mL). In the elastase inhibition assay and nitric oxide assay, the IC50 of methanolic extract of Persicaria senticosa was 739.7 mug/mL and 71.8 mug/mL. The Persicaria senticosa 70% ethanolic extract partitioned with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, n-BuOH, and aqueous fractions. The purification of EtOAc soluble layer was by column chromatography separation and MPLC analysis of Compounds 1-7. It was identified as loliolide (1), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (2), quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (3), 4-methoxy caftraric acid (4), kaempferol-3-(6-methylglucuronide) (5), quercetin-3-(6-methylglucuronide) (6), and quercetin (7). Structure was elucidated by a combination of 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectrometry as well as comparison with reported literatures. Radical scavenging effect on DPPH, tyrosinase inhibition, and nitric oxide assay on several compounds from Persicaria senticosa was found to show potent activity. The results showed that Compound 7 has the NO assay (IC5029.7 muM). For DPPH, the IC50 of Compounds 2, 3, 5, and 7 was 39.6, 31.2, 37.0, and 22.7 muM. In tyrosinase inhibitory activity, the IC50 of Compound 7 was 14.3 muM.
33328353/The Polyphosphate Kinase of Escherichia coli Is Required for Full Production of the Genotoxin Colibactin Colibactin-producing E. coli induces DNA damage in eukaryotic cells and promotes tumor formation in mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Recent studies have provided strong evidence supporting the causative role of colibactin in human colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. ABSTRACT Colibactin induces DNA damage in mammalian cells and has been linked to the virulence of Escherichia coli and the promotion of colorectal cancer (CRC). By looking for mutants attenuated in the promoter activity of clbB encoding one of the key enzymes for the production of colibactin, we found that a mutant of the gene coding for the polyphosphate kinase (PPK) produced less colibactin than the parental strain. We observed this phenotype in different strains ranging from pathogens responsible for meningitis, urinary tract infection, or mouse colon carcinogenesis to the probiotic Nissle 1917. We confirmed the role of PPK by using an inhibitor of PPK enzymatic activity, mesalamine (also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid). Interestingly, mesalamine has a local anti-inflammatory effect on the epithelial cells of the colon and is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Upon treatment with mesalamine, a decreased genotoxicity of colibactin-producing E. coli was observed both on epithelial cells and directly on purified DNA. This demonstrates the direct effect of mesalamine on bacteria independently from its anti-inflammatory effect on eukaryotic cells. Our results suggest that the mechanisms of action of mesalamine in treating IBD and preventing CRC could also lie in the inhibition of colibactin production. All in all, we demonstrate that PPK is required for the promoter activity of clbB and the production of colibactin, which suggests that PPK is a promising target for the development of anticolibactin and antivirulence strategies. IMPORTANCE Colibactin-producing E. coli induces DNA damage in eukaryotic cells and promotes tumor formation in mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Recent studies have provided strong evidence supporting the causative role of colibactin in human colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Therefore, it is important to understand the regulation of the production of this genotoxin. Here, we demonstrate that polyphosphate kinase (PPK) is required for the promoter activity of clbB and the production of colibactin. Interestingly, PPK is a multifunctional player in bacterial virulence and stress responses and has been proposed as a new target for developing antimicrobial medicine. We observed inhibition of colibactin production by using a previously identified PPK inhibitor (i.e., mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory drug commonly prescribed for inflammatory bowel diseases). These data brought us a new perspective on the regulatory network of colibactin production and provided us a clue for the development of anticolibactin strategies for CRC treatment/prophylaxis.
33424439/Beneficial Effects of Rosmarinic Acid on IPEC-J2 Cells Exposed to the Combination of Deoxynivalenol and T-2 Toxin Mycotoxin contamination in feedstuffs is a worldwide problem that causes serious health issues both in humans and animals, and it contributes to serious economic losses. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and T-2 toxin (T-2) are major trichothecene mycotoxins and are known to challenge mainly intestinal barrier functions. Polyphenolic rosmarinic acid (RA) appeared to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate protective effects of RA against DON and T-2 or combined mycotoxin-induced intestinal damage in nontumorigenic porcine cell line, IPEC-J2. It was ascertained that simultaneous treatment of DON and T-2 (DT2: 1 mumol/L DON + 5 nmol/L T - 2) for 48 h and 72 h reduced transepithelial electrical resistance of cell monolayer, which was restored by 50 mumol/L RA application. It was also found that DT2 for 48 h and 72 h could induce oxidative stress and elevate interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels significantly, which were alleviated by the administration of RA. DT2 administration contributed to the redistribution of claudin-1; however, occludin membranous localization was not altered by combined mycotoxin treatment. In conclusion, beneficial effect of RA was exerted on DT2-deteriorated cell monolayer integrity and on the perturbated redox status of IPEC-J2 cells.
33323514/Neonatal Mouse Gut Metabolites Influence Cryptosporidium parvum Infection in Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cryptosporidium sp. occupies a unique intracellular niche that exposes the parasite to both host cell contents and the intestinal lumen, including metabolites from the diet and produced by the microbiota. Both dietary and microbial products change over the course of early development and could contribute to the changes seen in susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis in humans and mice. ABSTRACT The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium sp. is a leading cause of diarrheal disease in those with compromised or underdeveloped immune systems, particularly infants and toddlers in resource-poor localities. As an enteric pathogen, Cryptosporidium sp. invades the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells, where it resides in close proximity to metabolites in the intestinal lumen. However, the effect of gut metabolites on susceptibility to Cryptosporidium infection remains largely unstudied. Here, we first identified which gut metabolites are prevalent in neonatal mice when they are most susceptible to Cryptosporidium parvum infection and then tested the isolated effects of these metabolites on C. parvum invasion and growth in intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that medium or long-chain saturated fatty acids inhibit C. parvum growth, perhaps by negatively affecting the streamlined metabolism in C. parvum, which is unable to synthesize fatty acids. Conversely, long-chain unsaturated fatty acids enhanced C. parvum invasion, possibly by modulating membrane fluidity. Hence, gut metabolites, either from diet or produced by the microbiota, influence C. parvum growth in vitro and may also contribute to the early susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis seen in young animals.
33323506/Nitric Oxide Circumvents Virus-Mediated Metabolic Regulation during Human Cytomegalovirus Infection Human cytomegalovirus is a prevalent pathogen that can cause serious disease in patients with compromised immune systems, including transplant patients and during congenital infection. HCMV lytic replication likely occurs in localized sites of infection with immune cells infiltrating and releasing nitric oxide with other effector molecules. ABSTRACT Nitric oxide is a versatile and critical effector molecule that can modulate many cellular functions. Although recognized as a regulator of infections, the inhibitory mechanism of nitric oxide against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication remains elusive. We demonstrate that nitric oxide attenuates viral replication by interfering with HCMV-mediated modulation of several cellular processes. Nitric oxide exposure reduced HCMV genome synthesis and infectious viral progeny with cell-type-dependent differences observed. Mitochondrial respiration was severely reduced in both uninfected and HCMV-infected cells during exposure with little impact on ATP levels indicating changes in cellular metabolism. Metabolomics identified significantly altered small molecules in multiple pathways during nitric oxide exposure including nucleotide biosynthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glutamine metabolism. Glutathione metabolites were increased coinciding with a reduction in the glutathione precursor glutamine. This shift was accompanied by increased antioxidant enzymes. Glutamine deprivation mimicked defects in HCMV replication and mitochondrial respiration observed during nitric oxide exposure. These data suggest that nitric oxide limits glutaminolysis by shuttling glutamine to glutathione synthesis. In addition, lipid intermediates were severely altered, which likely contributes to the observed increase in defective viral particles. Nitric oxide disrupts multiple cellular processes, and we had limited success in rescuing replication defects by supplementing with metabolic intermediates. Our studies indicate that nitric oxide attenuation of HCMV is multifactorial with interference in viral manipulation of cellular metabolism playing a central role.
33323508/Iron Flocs and the Three Domains: Microbial Interactions in Freshwater Iron Mats Freshwater iron mats are dynamic geochemical environments with broad ecological diversity, primarily formed by the iron-oxidizing bacteria. The community features functional groups involved in biogeochemical cycles for iron, sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen. ABSTRACT Freshwater iron mats are dynamic geochemical environments with broad ecological diversity, primarily formed by the iron-oxidizing bacteria. The community features functional groups involved in biogeochemical cycles for iron, sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen. Despite this complexity, iron mat communities provide an excellent model system for exploring microbial ecological interactions and ecological theories in situ. Syntrophies and competition between the functional groups in iron mats, how they connect cycles, and the maintenance of these communities by taxons outside bacteria (the eukaryota, archaea, and viruses) have been largely unstudied. Here, we review what is currently known about freshwater iron mat communities, the taxa that reside there, and the interactions between these organisms, and we propose ways in which future studies may uncover exciting new discoveries. For example, the archaea in these mats may play a greater role than previously thought as they are diverse and widespread in iron mats based on 16S rRNA genes and include methanogenic taxa. Studies with a holistic view of the iron mat community members focusing on their diverse interactions will expand our understanding of community functions, such as those involved in pollution removal. To begin addressing questions regarding the fundamental interactions and to identify the conditions in which they occur, more laboratory culturing techniques and coculture studies, more network and keystone species analyses, and the expansion of studies to more freshwater iron mat systems are necessary. Increasingly accessible bioinformatic, geochemical, and culturing tools now open avenues to address the questions that we pose herein.
33323510/The Bactericidal Fatty Acid Mimetic 2CCA-1 Selectively Targets Pneumococcal Extracellular Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Metabolism Fatty acid biosynthesis is an attractive antibiotic target, as it affects the supply of membrane phospholipid building blocks. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, it is not sufficient to target only the endogenous fatty acid synthesis machinery, as uptake of host fatty acids may bypass this inhibition. ABSTRACT Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis worldwide, has the nasopharynges of small children as its main ecological niche. Depletion of pneumococci from this niche would reduce the disease burden and could be achieved using small molecules with narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity. We identified the alkylated dicyclohexyl carboxylic acid 2CCA-1 as a potent inducer of autolysin-mediated lysis of S. pneumoniae, while having low activity against Staphylococcus aureus. 2CCA-1-resistant strains were found to have inactivating mutations in fakB3, known to be required for uptake of host polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as through inactivation of the transcriptional regulator gene fabT, vital for endogenous, de novo fatty acid synthesis regulation. Structure activity relationship exploration revealed that, besides the central dicyclohexyl group, the fatty acid-like structural features of 2CCA-1 were essential for its activity. The lysis-inducing activity of 2CCA-1 was considerably more potent than that of free fatty acids and required growing bacteria, suggesting that 2CCA-1 needs to be metabolized to exert its antimicrobial activity. Total lipid analysis of 2CCA-1 treated bacteria identified unique masses that were modeled to 2CCA-1 containing lysophosphatidic and phosphatidic acid in wild-type but not in fakB3 mutant bacteria. This suggests that 2CCA-1 is metabolized as a fatty acid via FakB3 and utilized as a phospholipid building block, leading to accumulation of toxic phospholipid species. Analysis of FabT-mediated fakB3 expression elucidates how the pneumococcus could ensure membrane homeostasis and concurrent economic use of host-derived fatty acids.
33425213/Effect of Hypovitaminosis D on Lipid Profile in Hypothyroid Patients in Saudi Arabia Background  Hypothyroidism is believed to be associated with dyslipidemia and is considered a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). Vitamin D, due to its steroid hormone action, retains cell function and controls the metabolism of lipids. Therefore, the present study was carried out to show the association of the risk factors of ASCVD and deficiency of thyroid hormones and vitamin D levels since no previous studies have been performed on Saudi patients before. Methodology. A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 400 hypothyroid patients. Medical records of those patients were followed up and were classified as normal and hypothyroid patients according to their thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. TSH, vitamin D, and lipid profiles were determined using the ELISA technique.  Result  Total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in hypothyroid patients than those in the normal group. We have found a significant correlation between TSH levels and the risk factors of ASCVD (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C). Moreover, a significant correlation between vitamin D levels and the risk factors of ASCVD (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C) has been found. In addition, there is a correlation between deficiency of Vit D and low-TSH levels (95% CI 1.092-4.05) indicating a higher risk for the development of ASCVD among those patients.  Conclusion  Hypothyroid and vitamin D-deficient patients must be screened regularly at an early stage to predict and also to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, an adequate supply of vitamin D and TH should be given to those patients to prevent cardiovascular diseases at an early stage.
33425206/Azelaic Acid Exerts Antileukemia Effects against Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Regulating the Prdxs/ROS Signaling Pathway Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy with a poor prognosis attributed to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Thus, agents that inhibit ROS generation in AML should be exploited. Azelaic acid (AZA), a small molecular compound, can scavenge ROS and other free radicals, exerting antitumor effects on various tumor cells. Herein, this study evaluated the antileukemic activity of AZA against AML via regulation of the ROS signaling pathway. We found that AZA reduced intracellular ROS levels and increased total antioxidant capacity in AML cell lines and AML patient cells. AZA suppressed the proliferation of AML cell lines and AML patient cells, expending minimal cytotoxicity on healthy cells. Laser confocal microscopy showed that AZA-treated AML cells surged and ruptured gradually on microfluidic chips. Additionally, AZA promoted AML cell apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Further analysis demonstrated that peroxiredoxin (Prdx) 2 and Prdx3 were upregulated in AZA-treated AML cells. In vivo, AZA prolonged survival and attenuated AML by decreasing CD33+ immunophenotyping in the bone marrow of a patient-derived xenograft AML model. Furthermore, mice in the AZA-treated group had an increased antioxidant capacity and Prdx2/Prdx3 upregulation. The findings indicate that AZA may be a potential agent against AML by regulating the Prdxs/ROS signaling pathway.
33386071/Potential natural inhibitors of xanthine oxidase and HMG-CoA reductase in cholesterol regulation: in silico analysis Background Hypercholesterolemia has posed a serious threat of heart diseases and stroke worldwide. Xanthine oxidase (XO), the rate-limiting enzyme in uric acid biosynthesis, is regarded as the root of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that generate atherosclerosis and cholesterol crystals. beta-Hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Although some commercially available enzyme inhibiting drugs have effectively reduced cholesterol levels, most of them have failed to meet potential drug candidates' requirements. Here, we have carried out an in-silico analysis of secondary metabolites that have already shown good inhibitory activity against XO and HMGR in a wet lab setup. Methods Out of 118 secondary metabolites reviewed, sixteen molecules inhibiting XO and HMGR were selected based on the IC50 values reported in in vitro assays. Further, receptor-based virtual screening was carried out against secondary metabolites using GOLD Protein-Ligand Docking Software, combined with subsequent post-docking, to study the binding affinities of ligands to the enzymes. In-silico ADMET analysis was carried out to explore their pharmacokinetic properties, followed by toxicity prediction through ProTox-II. Results The molecular docking of amentoflavone (GOLD score 70.54,  G calc. = - 10.4 Kcal/mol) and ganomycin I (GOLD score 59.61,  G calc. = - 6.8 Kcal/mol) displayed that the drug has effectively bound at the competitive site of XO and HMGR, respectively. Besides, 6-paradol and selgin could be potential drug candidates inhibiting XO. Likewise, n-octadecanyl-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl (6'   1'')-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside could be potential drug candidates to maintain serum cholesterol. In-silico ADMET analysis has shown that these sixteen metabolites were optimal within the categorical range compared to commercially available XO and HMGR inhibitors, respectively. Toxicity analysis through ProTox-II revealed that 6-gingerol, ganoleucoin K, and ganoleucoin Z are toxic for human use. Conclusion This computational analysis supports earlier experimental evidence towards the inhibition of XO and HMGR by natural products. Further study is necessary to explore the clinical efficacy of these secondary molecules, which might be alternatives for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
33395438/Nitrogen signals and their ecological significance for seed germination of ten psammophilous plant species from European dry acidic grasslands The presented study evaluated effects of potassium nitrate (KNO3), ammonium nitrate (NH4 NO3) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) on the germination-related characteristics of 10 species from European dry acidic grasslands. Germination was studied under controlled laboratory conditions. The seeds were subjected to KNO3, NH4 NO3 and NH4Cl in four doses (1, 10, 50 and 100 mM) and to distilled water. Final germination percentage, index of germination velocity and index of germination synchrony were determined. Content of nitrogen in the soil probed from the site of seeds collection was also analyzed. Significant effects of type of the nitrogen compounds and their concentrations were observed. High concentrations of nitrogen-containing salts inhibited completion of germination in almost all species. Helichrysum arenarium and Hypericum perforatum showed preference for NH4+ over NO3-, whereas Arnoseris minima, Alyssum montanum, Jasione montana and Spergula morisonii showed preference for NO3- over NH4+. Centaurea scabiosa, C. stoebe and Hypochaeris radicata had no preference and wide tolerance to the type of nitrogen-containing compound. Echium vulgare showed differential response hard for interpretation. A. montanum and J. montana showed stenotopic behavior in terms of nitrogen-related conditions. It is proposed that nitrogen-rich soil gaps favor establishment of more nitro-tolerant plant species (e.g. C. scabiosa, C. stoebe and H. radicata) as compared to nitrogen-poor ones.
33395448/Influence of graphene on the multiple metabolic pathways of Zea mays roots based on transcriptome analysis Graphene reportedly exerts positive effects on plant root growth and development, although the corresponding molecular response mechanism remains to be elucidated. Maize seeds were randomly divided into a control and experimental group, and the roots of Zea mays L. seedlings were watered with different concentrations (0-100 mg/L) of graphene to explore the effects and molecular mechanism of graphene on the growth and development of Z. mays L. Upon evaluating root growth indices, 50 mg/L graphene remarkably increased total root length, root volume, and the number of root tips and forks of maize seedlings compared to those of the control group. We observed that the contents of nitrogen and potassium in rhizosphere soil increased following the 50 mg/L graphene treatment. Thereafter, we compared the transcriptome changes in Z. mays roots in response to the 50 mg/L graphene treatment. Transcriptional factor regulation, plant hormone signal transduction, nitrogen and potassium metabolism, as well as secondary metabolism in maize roots subjected to graphene treatment, exhibited significantly upregulated expression, all of which could be related to mechanisms underlying the response to graphene. Based on qPCR validations, we proposed several candidate genes that might have been affected with the graphene treatment of maize roots. The transcriptional profiles presented here provide a foundation for deciphering the mechanism underlying graphene and maize root interaction.
33425220/Novel PGC-1alpha/ATF5 Axis Partly Activates UPRmt and Mediates Cardioprotective Role of Tetrahydrocurcumin in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy Mitochondrial unfolding protein response (UPRmt) effectively resists the pathological cardiac hypertrophy and improves the mitochondrial function. However, the specific activation mechanism and drugs that can effectively activate UPRmt in the cardiac muscle are yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the regulation role of UPRmt on preventing pathological cardiac hypertrophy by tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) and explore its underlying molecular mechanism. Male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice were divided into a control group and subjected to sham treatment for 4 weeks, and a test group which was subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. Animals in the control and test group were orally administered THC (50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks after TAC procedure; an equivalent amount of saline was orally administered in the control sham-treated group and the TAC group. Subsequently, oxidative stress and UPRmt markers were assessed in these mice, and cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac function were tested. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha and activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) were used to determine the UPRmt activation mechanism. THC supplement partly upregulated UPRmt effectors and inhibited TAC-induced oxidative stress compared with TAC-operated WT mice, thereby substantially attenuating contractile dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Furthermore, PGC-1alpha knockdown blunted the UPRmt activation and the cardioprotective role of THC. The interaction between PGC-1alpha and ATF5 was tested in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes under normal conditions. The results showed that PGC-1alpha was an upstream effector of ATF5 and partly activated UPRmt. In vitro, phenylephrine- (PE-) induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy caused ATF5 upregulating rather than downregulating corresponding to the downregulation of PGC-1alpha. The PGC-1alpha/ATF5 axis mediated the UPRmt activation and stress-resistance role of THC in vitro. Collectively, the present study provides the first evidence that PGC-1 and ATF5 can form a signaling axis to partly activate UPRmt that mediates the cardioprotective role of THC in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
33424436/Oxidative and/or Inflammatory Thrust Induced by Silver Nanoparticles in Rabbits: Effect of Vitamin E or NSAID Administration on Semen Parameters The aim of this research was to evaluate the inflammatory and/or oxidative damage related to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which are responsible for negative effects on sperm physiology and metabolism. Thirty New Zealand White rabbit bucks were divided into 5 experimental groups (6 animals/group): Control, treated with 0.9% NaCl; AgNP, treated with a 5 mM AgNP solution; LPS, treated with 50 g/kg b.w. E. coli LPS; AgNPs + NSAID, treated with an anti-inflammatory drug at 0.2 mg/kg b.w. and 5 mM AgNPs; and AgNPs + Vit E, treated with 0.18 mg/kg b.w. vitamin E and 5 mM AgNPs. Sperm quality and oxidative and inflammatory status were assessed at different times (0-60 days). Two statistical models were built: the first evaluated the effects of AgNPs and LPS (vs. Control), whereas the second evaluated the protective effect of an NSAID and vitamin E against AgNP-induced damage. Three principal component analyses were performed: sperm traits (motility, volume), oxidative status (antioxidants, oxidative metabolites, and redox reactions), and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IL-6). A negative effect on reproductive traits resulted after NP administration. In particular, an inflammatory/oxidative response took place in the reproductive tract during the first 2-3 wks of AgNP administration (cytokine and oxidative metabolite generation); the inflammatory/oxidative thrust impaired the status of rabbit tissues (seminal plasma, sperm, and blood), inducing a response (increased antioxidant enzymes and redox reactions) at 4-7 wks; oxidative stress, if not totally counteracted, likely induced toxicity in the late phases of AgNP administration (8-9 wks). In conclusion, exposure to silver nanoparticles produced a similar but more persistent effect than that of LPS on rabbit reproductive tissues: AgNP administration triggered a proinflammatory response linked to oxidative thrust, worsening many sperm parameters. However, only anti-inflammatory treatment counteracted the negative effects of AgNPs, whereas vitamin E seemed to act as an adjuvant, attenuating the oxidative cascade.
33356727/alpha-Hederin inhibits the growth of lung cancer A549 cells in vitro and in vivo by decreasing SIRT6 dependent glycolysis Abstract Context alpha-Hederin, a potent bioactive compound of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel (Ranunculaceae), has many pharmacological uses, but its effect on cancer cell metabolism is still unclear. Objective To elucidate the role of alpha-hederin in the glucose metabolism of lung cancer cells. Materials and methods Cell Counting Kit 8 and colony formation assays were employed to assess the antiproliferative effects of alpha-hederin. Glucose uptake, ATP generation, and lactate production were measured. Glycolysis-related proteins were detected using western blotting, and a sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) inhibitor was used to verify A549 cell proliferation. Sixty male BALB/c nude mice were divided into normal control, 5-FU (25 mg/kg), and alpha-hederin (5 and 10 mg/kg) groups to assess the antitumor effect for 32 days. Glycolysis-related protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis. Results alpha-Hederin inhibited A549 (IC50 = 13.75 muM), NCI-H460 (IC50 = 17.57 muM), and NCI-H292 (IC50 = 18.04 muM) proliferation; inhibited glucose uptake and ATP generation; and reduced lactate production. Furthermore, alpha-hederin (10 and 15 muM) markedly inhibited hexokinase 2, glucose transporter 1, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, monocarboxylate transporter, c-Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, and activated SIRT6 protein expression. Using a SIRT6 inhibitor, we demonstrated that alpha-hederin inhibits glycolysis by activating SIRT6. A tumour xenograft mouse model of lung cancer confirmed that alpha-hederin (5 and 10 mg/kg) inhibits lung cancer growth by inhibiting glycolysis in vivo. Discussion and conclusions alpha-Hederin inhibits A549 cell growth by inhibiting SIRT6-dependent glycolysis. alpha-Hederin might serve as a potential agent to suppress cancer.
33356653/Inhibition of the beta-carbonic anhydrase from the protozoan pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis with sulphonamides Abstract Sulphonamides and their isosteres are classical inhibitors of the carbonic anhydrase (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) metalloenzymes. The protozoan pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis encodes two such enzymes belonging to the beta-class, TvaCA1 and TvaCA2. Here we report the first sulphonamide inhibition study of TvaCA1, with a series of simple aromatic/heterocyclic primary sulphonamides as well as with clinically approved/investigational drugs for a range of pathologies (diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, antiobesity, and antitumor drugs). TvaCA1 was effectively inhibited by acetazolamide and ethoxzolamide, with KIs of 391 and 283 nM, respectively, whereas many other simple or clinically used sulphonamides were micromolar inhibitors or did not efficiently inhibit the enzyme. Finding more effective TvaCA1 inhibitors may constitute an innovative approach for fighting trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection, caused by T. vaginalis.
33356629/L-EGCG-Mn nanoparticles as a pH-sensitive MRI contrast agent Abstract This study aimed to synthesize and characterize L-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) complexed Mn2+ nanoparticle (L-EGCG-Mn), a proof-of-concept pH-sensitive manganese core nanoparticle (NP), and compare its magnetic resonance (MR) properties with those of Gd-DTPA, both in vitro and in vivo. Reverse microemulsion was used to obtain the L-EGCG-Mn NPs. The physicochemical properties of L-EGCG-Mn were characterized using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and near-infrared fluorescence small animal live imaging. The in vitro relaxivity of L-EGCG-Mn incubated with different pH buffer solutions (pH = 7.4, 6.8, 5.5) was evaluated. The T1-weighted MR imaging (MRI) properties were evaluated in vitro using hypoxic H22 cells as well as in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Cytotoxicity tests and histological analysis were performed to evaluate the safety of L-EGCG-Mn. L-EGCG-Mn showed good biocompatibility, stability, pH sensitivity, and tumor-targeting ability. Moreover, when the pH was decreased from 7.4 to 5.5, the r1 relaxivity of L-EGCG-Mn was shown to gradually increase from 1.79 to 6.43 mM-1 s-1. Furthermore, after incubation with L-EGCG-Mn for 4 h, the T1 relaxation time of hypoxic H22 cells was significantly lower than that of normoxic H22 cells (1788 +- 89 vs. 1982 +- 68 ms, p=.041). The in vivo analysis showed that after injection, L-EGCG-Mn exhibited a higher MRI signal compared to Gd-DTPA in H22 tumor-bearing mice (p < .05). Furthermore, L-EGCG-Mn was found to have a good safety profile via cytotoxicity tests and histological analysis. L-EGCG-Mn has a good safety profile and pH sensitivity and may thus serve as a potential MRI contrast agent.
33372563/Preparation and evaluation of conjugate nanogels of glycyl-prednisolone with natural anionic polysaccharides as anti-arthritic delivery systems Abstract Although prednisolone (PD) is used as an anti-arthritis drug due to its rapid and strong anti-inflammatory potential, its frequent and large dosing often brings about adverse effects. Therefore, targeting therapy has attracted increasing attention to overcome such adverse effects. In the present study, nanogels (NGs) composed of macromolecule-PD conjugates were developed as a novel targeting delivery system, and their anti-inflammatory potential was examined. Conjugates were prepared by carbodiimide coupling between glycyl-prednisolone (GP) and the natural anionic polysaccharides, alginic acid (AL) and hyaluronic acid (HA). NGs were produced by the evaporation of organic solvent from the conjugate solution. The obtained NGs, named AL-GP-NG and HA-GP-NG, respectively, were examined for particle characteristics, in vitro release, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy. Both NGs were several hundred nanometers in size, had negative zeta potentials, and several % (w/w) drug contents. They released PD gradually at pH 7.4 and 6. They exhibited fairly good retention in the systemic circulation. In the efficacy examination using rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, both NGs showed the stronger and more prolonged suppression of paw inflammation than PD alone. These suggested that the present NGs should be possibly useful as anti-arthritis targeting therapeutic systems.
33390061/Anion inhibition studies of the Zn(II)-bound iota-carbonic anhydrase from the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia territorii Abstract Burkholderia territorii, a Gram-negative bacterium, encodes for the iota-class carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) BteCAiota, which was recently characterised. It acts as a good catalyst for the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons, with a kcat value of 3.0 x 105 s-1 and kcat/KM value of 3.9 x 107 M-1 s-1. No inhibition data on this new class of enzymes are available to date. We report here an anion and small molecules inhibition study of BteCAiota, which we prove to be a zinc(II)- and not manganese(II)-containing enzyme, as reported for diatom iota-CAs. The best inhibitors were sulphamic acid, stannate, phenylarsonic acid, phenylboronic acid and sulfamide (KI values of 6.2-94 microM), whereas diethyldithiocarbamate, tellurate, selenate, bicarbonate and cyanate were submillimolar inhibitors (KI values of 0.71-0.94 mM). The halides (except iodide), thiocyanate, nitrite, nitrate, carbonate, bisulphite, sulphate, hydrogensulfide, peroxydisulfate, selenocyanate, fluorosulfonate and trithiocarbonate showed KI values in the range of 3.1-9.3 mM.
33456673/Alanylglutamine Relieved Asthma Symptoms by Regulating Gut Microbiota and the Derived Metabolites in Mice Objective  Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which seriously affects the life quality of patients, especially children. Alanylglutamine is a nutritional supplement with potential protective and anti-inflammatory effects, but its function in allergic asthma remains elusive. In this study, we focused on the investigations of the roles and functional mechanism of Alanylglutamine in asthma.  Methods  Ovalbumin (OVA) induction was utilized to establish a mouse asthma model. 16S rDNA sequencing was performed to compare the diversity of intestinal microorganisms under different treatments. Gas chromatography was utilized to screen the intestinal microbe-short-chain fatty acids in the stool. The lung tissue was extracted to determine signaling pathways, including AMPK, NF-kappaB, mTOR, STAT3, IKKbeta, TGF-beta, and IL-1beta through Western blot or RT-qPCR.  Results  It was observed that Alanylglutamine reduced the cytokine in OVA-induced allergic asthma mice. H&E staining showed obvious pneumonia symptoms in the asthma group, while Alanylglutamine alleviated the inflammatory infiltration. Alanylglutamine reversed gut microbiota compositions in OVA-induced allergic asthma mice and enhanced the butyric acid level. The protective role of Alanylglutamine may be associated with the gut microbiota-butyric acid-GPR43 pathway in asthma mice. In contrast to the OVA group, Alanylglutamine activated the protein expression of P-AMPK/AMPK and inhibited the protein expression of P-mTOR/mTOR, P-P65/P65, P-STAT3/STAT3, P-IKKbeta/IKKbeta, TGF-beta, and IL-1beta, with similar effects from butyric acid.  Conclusion  The results indicated that Alanylglutamine might be beneficial for asthma, and its effect was achieved through the regulation on microbiota and the derived metabolites. The therapeutic effects might be associated with AMPK, NF-kappaB, mTOR, and STAT3 signaling pathways. These findings will help identify effective therapeutic direction to alleviate allergic inflammation of the lungs and airways.
33457406/Curcumin and Glu-GNPs Induce Radiosensitivity against Breast Cancer Stem-Like Cells Breast cancer stem cells are an important cause of radiotherapy resistance in the clinical treatment of breast cancer patients. How to target breast cancer stem cells is the key to improving the efficacy of breast cancer radiotherapy. We proposed for the first time that curcumin combined with glucose nanogold particles (Glu-GNPs) targeted breast cancer stem cells to reduce radiotherapy resistance, which can significantly enhance the apoptosis level of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) after radiotherapy and antiproliferation and colony-forming. Under simulated hypoxic conditions, curcumin combined with Glu-GNPs can significantly improve the ROS level of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammospheres; reduce the expression of HIF-1alpha and HSP90, thereby inhibiting the tumor cells' own stress ability; promote the apoptosis of tumor stem cells; and enhance the sensitivity of radiotherapy. The current results indicate that the combination of curcumin and Glu-GNPs has great potential to relieve tumor hypoxia and increase radiosensitivity on BCSCs, providing scientific research data for developing a novel radiosensitizer with high efficiency and low toxicity.
33457420/Redirecting Metabolic Flux towards the Mevalonate Pathway for Enhanced beta-Carotene Production in M. circinelloides CBS 277.49 Carotenoids produced by microbial sources are of industrial and medicinal importance due to their antioxidant and anticancer properties. In the current study, optimization of beta-carotene production in M. circinelloides strain 277.49 was achieved using response surface methodology (RSM). Cerulenin and ketoconazole were used to inhibit fatty acids and the sterol biosynthesis pathway, respectively, in order to enhance beta-carotene production by diverting metabolic pool towards the mevalonate pathway. All three variables used in screening experiments were found to be significant for the production of beta-carotene. The synergistic effect of the C/N ratio, cerulenin, and ketoconazole was further evaluated and optimized for superior beta-carotene production using central composite design of RSM. Our results found that the synergistic combination of C/N ratios, cerulenin, and ketoconazole at different concentrations affected the beta-carotene productions significantly. The optimal production medium (std. order 11) composed of C/N 25, 10 mug/mL cerulenin, and 150 mg/L ketoconazole, producing maximum beta-carotene of 4.26 mg/L (0.43 mg/g) which was 157% greater in comparison to unoptimized medium (1.68 mg/L, 0.17 mg/g). So, it was concluded that metabolic flux had been successfully redirected towards the mevalonate pathway for enhanced beta-carotene production in CBS 277.49.
33402146/MiR-608 overexpression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease that causes scarring of the lungs. The disease is associated with the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, which was not yet fully recapitulated by an animal model. Therefore, the disease is considered 'human specific'. miRNA-608 is a primate specific miRNA with many potential targets, such CdC42 and Interlukin-6 (IL-6) that were previously implicated in IPF pathology.  Objective To test miR-608 expression and its targets in IPF patient samples. Methods RNA was extracted from Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections (N = 18). miRNA-608 and Cdc42 and IL-6 levels were analyzed by qPCR. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is another target of miRNA-608. Its' rs17228616 allele has a single-nucleotide polymorphism causing weakened miR-608 interaction (C2098A). Thus, DNA was extracted from whole blood samples from 56 subjects with fibrosing interstitial lung disease and this region was sequenced for assessment of rs17228616 allele polymorphism. Results miR-608 is significantly overexpressed in IPF samples in comparison with controls (p < 0.05). Cdc42 and IL-6 levels were lower in the IPF patient samples compared with control samples (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). The frequency of the rs17228616 minor A-allele was 17/56 (30.4%) with all patients being heterozygous. This result is significant vs. the published Israeli cohort of healthy individuals, which reported 17% prevalence of this allele in healthy control volunteers (p = 0.01, OR = 2.1, CI 95% [1.19-3.9]). Conclusion miR-608 is overexpressed in IPF patients. While the exact mechanism remains to be discovered, it could potentially promote fibrotic disease.
33402167/Microglial activation contributes to cognitive impairments in rotenone-induced mouse Parkinson's disease model Background Cognitive decline occurs frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD), which greatly decreases the quality of life of patients. However, the mechanisms remain to be investigated. Neuroinflammation mediated by overactivated microglia is a common pathological feature in multiple neurological disorders, including PD. This study is designed to explore the role of microglia in cognitive deficits by using a rotenone-induced mouse PD model. Methods To evaluate the role of microglia in rotenone-induced cognitive deficits, PLX3397, an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, and minocycline, a widely used antibiotic, were used to deplete or inactivate microglia, respectively. Cognitive performance of mice among groups was detected by Morris water maze, objective recognition, and passive avoidance tests. Neurodegeneration, synaptic loss, alpha-synuclein phosphorylation, glial activation, and apoptosis were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot or immunofluorescence staining. The gene expression of inflammatory factors and lipid peroxidation were further explored by using RT-PCR and ELISA kits, respectively. Results Rotenone dose-dependently induced cognitive deficits in mice by showing decreased performance of rotenone-treated mice in the novel objective recognition, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze compared with that of vehicle controls. Rotenone-induced cognitive decline was associated with neurodegeneration, synaptic loss, and Ser129-phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and microglial activation in the hippocampal and cortical regions of mice. A time course experiment revealed that rotenone-induced microglial activation preceded neurodegeneration. Interestingly, microglial depletion by PLX3397 or inactivation by minocycline significantly reduced neuronal damage and alpha-synuclein pathology as well as improved cognitive performance in rotenone-injected mice. Mechanistically, PLX3397 and minocycline attenuated rotenone-induced astroglial activation and production of cytotoxic factors in mice. Reduced lipid peroxidation was also observed in mice treated with combined PLX3397 or minocycline and rotenonee compared with rotenone alone group. Finally, microglial depletion or inactivation was found to mitigate rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis. Conclusions Taken together, our findings suggested that microglial activation contributes to cognitive impairments in a rotenone-induced mouse PD model via neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, providing novel insight into the immunopathogensis of cognitive deficits in PD.

33402188/P2X7R-mediated autophagic impairment contributes to central sensitization in a chronic migraine model with recurrent nitroglycerin stimulation in mice Background Central sensitization is an important pathophysiological mechanism of chronic migraine (CM). According to our previous studies, microglial activation and subsequent inflammation in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) contribute to the central sensitization. The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is a purinergic receptor expressed in microglia and participates in central sensitization in chronic pain, but its role in CM is unclear. Numerous studies have shown that P2X7R regulates the level of autophagy and that autophagy affects the microglial activation and inflammation. Recently, autophagy has been shown to be involved in neuropathic pain, but there is no information about autophagy in CM. Therefore, the current study investigated the role of P2X7R in CM and its underlying mechanism, focusing on autophagy regulation. Methods The CM model was established by repeated intraperitoneal injection of nitroglycerin (NTG) in mice. A Von Frey filament and radiant heat were used to assess the mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect the expression of P2X7R, autophagy-related proteins, and the cellular localization of P2X7R. To determine the role of P2X7R and autophagy in CM, we detected the effects of the autophagy inducer, rapamycin (RAPA) and P2X7R antagonist, Brilliant Blue G (BBG), on pain behavior and the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and c-fos. In addition, the effect of RAPA and BBG on microglial activation and subsequent inflammation were investigated. Results The expression of P2X7R was increased and was mainly colocalized with microglia in the TNC following recurrent NTG administration. The autophagic flux was blocked in CM, which was characterized by upregulated LC3-II, and accumulated autophagy substrate protein, p62. RAPA significantly improved the basal rather than acute hyperalgesia. BBG alleviated both basal and acute hyperalgesia. BBG activated the level of autophagic flux. RAPA and BBG inhibited the activation of microglia, limited the inflammatory response, and reduced the expression of CGRP and c-fos. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the dysfunction of the autophagic process in CM. Activated autophagy may have a preventive effect on migraine chronification. P2X7R contributes to central sensitization through mediating autophagy regulation and might become a potential target for CM.
33402180/Germacrone alleviates neurological deficits following traumatic brain injury by modulating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress Background Germacrone (GM) is a terpenoid compound which is reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. However, its role in treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains largely unknown. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into the following groups: control group, TBI group [controlled cortical impact (CCI) model], CCI + 5 mg/kg GM group, CCI + 10 mg/kg GM group and CCI + 20 mg/kg GM group. GM was administered via intraperitoneal injection. The neurological functions (including motor coordination, spatial learning and memory abilities) and brain edema were measured. Nissl staining was used to detect the neuronal apoptosis. Colorimetric assays and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to determine the expression levels of oxidative stress markers including myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the expressions of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Additionally, protein levels of Nrf2 and p-p65 were detected by Western blot assay. Results GM significantly ameliorated motor dysfunction, spatial learning and memory deficits of the mice induced by TBI and it also reduced neuronal apoptosis and microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, GM treatment reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress compared to those in the CCI group in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GM up-regulated the expression of antioxidant protein Nrf2 and inhibited the expression of inflammatory response protein p-p65. Conclusions GM is a promising drug to improve the functional recovery after TBI via repressing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
33457417/Synthesis and Characterization of New Dihydronaphthalene Candidates as Potent Cytotoxic Agents against MCF-7 Human Cancer Cells In the present work, a new series of dihydronaphthalene derivatives were synthesized starting with 6-methoxy-1-tetralone 1, and the corresponding hydrazine derivative 2. Reaction of compound 2 with aryl isothiocyanates produced thiosemicarbazides 3a-d, which were reacted with ethyl chloroacetate to give thiazolidinone derivatives 4a-d. Pyrano thiazolecarbonitrile derivatives 5a-f were prepared by heating a mixture of compounds 4a or 4c, aryl aldehydes, and malononitrile utilizing distilled water in the presence of catalytic amount of potassium hydrogen phthalate. Also, treatment of 4a with DMF-DMA under solvent-free conditions gave enaminone derivative 6, which condensed with ethyl acetoacetate or acetylacetone or malononitrile or cyanothioacetamide to give compounds 7-10, respectively. Finally, reaction of the enaminone 6 with 2-aminoimidazol or 2-aminothiazol in the presence of glacial acetic acid produced derivatives 11 and 12, respectively. Cytotoxic evaluation of eleven compounds, against MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines, was estimated. Results revealed that five of the examined compounds 5a, 5d, 5e, 10, and 3d showed potent cytotoxic activities recording, IC50 values; 0.93 +- 0.02, 1.76 +- 0.04, 2.36 +- 0.06, 2.83 +- 0.07, and 3.73 +- 0.09 muM, respectively, which were more potent than the reference used (Saturosporin, IC506.08 +- 0.15 muM). The new products were also examined towards normal epithelial breast cells (MCF10A). All of them showed very good safety profile with different degrees and were safer than the reference drug used. Compound 5a was the most effective against MCF-7 cells and was less toxic than Saturosporin by about 18.45-folds towards MCF01A normal cells. All the new compounds were fully characterized by the different spectral and analytical tools. Herein, detailed syntheses, spectroscopic, and biological data are reported.
33457416/Neuroprotective Effect of Syringic Acid by Modulation of Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Mass in Diabetic Rats Diabetes is a metabolic complaint associated with oxidative stress and dysfunction of mitochondria. One of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus is neuropathy. This study evaluated the possible neuroprotective effects of syringic acid (SYR), a natural polyphenolic derivative of benzoic acid, on oxidative damage and mitochondria in the brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Different groups of rats including normal control, diabetics (induced by streptozotocin), diabetic groups treated with 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg of SYR, and non-diabetic group treated with only 100 mg/kg of SYR were treated for 6 weeks. Learning and memory function, physical coordination, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and antioxidant indexes, as well as mRNA expression of mitochondrial biogenesis, were measured in the brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerves. Diabetic rats treated with 100 mg/kg SYR exhibited significantly improved learning, memory, and movement deficiency (p < 0.05). SYR 100 mg/kg also significantly upregulated the brain mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and NRF-1, the key regulators of energy metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, SYR 100 mg/kg and SYR 50 mg/kg increased the mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the brain and the spinal cord of diabetic rats, respectively (p < 0.05). SYR attenuated the lipid peroxidation in all the tissues, but not significant effects were observed on GSH, AChE, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activity. In all the tests, nonsignificant differences were observed between the control and SYR 100 mg/kg groups. Moreover, SYR reduced inflammation and demyelination in sciatic nerves. This is the first study to reveal the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism by SYR, beyond its antioxidant role in the diabetic rats' brain and spinal tissues.
33457403/Identification of the Functional Domain of HPIV3 Matrix Protein Interacting with Nucleocapsid Protein Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is the main pathogen that causes respiratory infections in infants, young children, and the elderly. Currently, there are no vaccines and effective anti-infective drugs. Studying the replication and proliferation mechanism of HPIV3 is helpful for exploring the targets of anti-HPIV3 infection. Matrix protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) are two key structural proteins of HPIV3 that exert important functions in HPIV3 proliferation. Herein, we aim to clarify the functional domains of M and N interaction. HPIV3 M and N expression plasmids of pCAGGS-HA-M and pCAGGS-N-Myc/Flag, M C-terminal truncation mutant plasmids of pCAGGSHA-MDeltaC120, MDeltaC170, MDeltaC190, and MDeltaC210, and M C-terminal plasmid of pCAGGS-HA-MC190 and C-terminal deletion mutant plasmid of pCAGGS-MDeltaN143-182 were constructed. By using immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and virus-like particle (VLP) germination experiments, we found that N was encapsulated into M-mediated VLP through N and M interaction. Moreover, the C-terminus of the M played a key role in the interaction between M and N. The C-terminus of the M encapsulated the N into the VLP. We finally determined that the 143-182 amino acids in the M were the functional regions that encapsulated the N into the M-mediated VLP. Our findings confirmed the interaction between M and N and for the first time clarified that the 143-182 amino acid region in M was the functional region that interacted with N, which provides a molecular basis for exploring effective anti-HPIV3 targets.
33457418/Attenuation of Perfluorooctane Sulfonate-Induced Steatohepatitis by Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Extract in Mice Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an environmentally persistent pollutant, has been revealed to elicit hepatic toxicity. In the current study, we investigated the protective role of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) against PFOS-caused steatohepatitis in mice. Animals were exposed intragastrically to PFOS (10 mg/kg/day), GSPE (150 mg/kg/day), or their combination. After 21 days of treatment, mice exposed to PFOS exhibited steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the liver. Nevertheless, simultaneous administration of GSPE resumed the declined serum hepatic enzyme activities and histological abnormalities in PFOS-exposed mice. Furthermore, GSPE supplementation reduced the contents of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) and expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes CD36 and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) in the liver of mice treated with PFOS. Moreover, GSPE suppressed the generation of lipid peroxidative product malondialdehyde and restored the activity of superoxide dismutase in the liver of PFOS-exposed mice. In addition, GSPE repressed the PFOS-induced hepatic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Our results demonstrate that GSPE attenuates PFOS-caused steatohepatitis in mice by regulating lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response.
33456676/Hyaluronic Acid Improves Hydrogen Peroxide Modulatory Effects on Calcium Channel and Sodium-Potassium Pump in 4T1 Breast Cancer Cell Line Maintaining homeostasis of ion concentrations is critical in cancer cells. Under hypoxia, the levels of channels and pumps in cancer cells are more active than normal cells suggesting ion channels as a suitable therapeutic target. One of the contemporary ways for cancer therapy is oxidative stress. However, the effective concentration of oxidative stress on tumor cells has been reported to be toxic for normal cells as well. In this study, we benefited from the modifying effects of hyaluronic acid (HA) on H2O2, as a free radical source, to make a gradual release of oxidative stress on cancer cells while preventing/decreasing damage to normal cells under normoxia and hypoxic conditions. To do so, we initially investigated the optimal concentration of HA antioxidant capacity by the DPPH test. In the next step, we found optimum H2O2 dose by treating the 4T1 breast cancer cell line with increasing concentrations (0, 10, 20, 50,100, 200, 500, and 1000 muM) of H2O2 alone or H2O2 + HA (83%) for 24 hrs. The calcium channel and the sodium-potassium pumps were then evaluated by measuring the levels of calcium, sodium, and potassium ions using an atomic absorption flame spectrophotometer. The results revealed that treatment with H2O2 or H2O2+ HA led to an intracellular increase of calcium, sodium, and potassium in the normoxic and hypoxic circumstances in a dose-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that H2O2 + HA treatment had more favorable and controllable effects compared with H2O2 alone. Moreover, HA optimizes the antitumor effect of oxidative stress exerted by H2O2 making H2O2 + HA suitable for clinical use in cancer treatment along with chemotherapy.
33456666/Danhong Injection Alleviates Cardiac Fibrosis via Preventing the Hypermethylation of Rasal1 and Rassf1 in TAC Mice Background/Aim  Danhong injection (DHI) is a Chinese patent drug used for relieving cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have suggested that DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of cardiac fibrosis (CF) in cardiovascular diseases. This study was aimed at identifying the effect and the underlying mechanism of DHI on CF, especially the DNA methylation.  Methods  A CF murine model was established by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC). A 28-day daily treatment with or without DHI via intraperitoneal injection was carried out immediately following TAC surgery. The changes in cardiac function, pathology, and fibrosis following TAC were measured by echocardiography and immunostaining. We used methyl-seq analysis to assess the DNA methylation changes in whole genes and identified the methylation changes of two Ras signaling-related genes in TAC mice, including Ras protein activator like-1 (Rasal1) and Ras-association domain family 1 (Rassf1). Next, the methylation status and expression levels of Rasal1 and Rassf1 genes were consolidated by bisulfite sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting, respectively. To determine the underlying molecular mechanism, the expressions of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), fibrosis-related genes, and the activity of Ras/ERK were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.  Results  DHI treatment alleviated CF and significantly improved cardiac function on day 28 of TAC. The methyl-seq analysis identified 42,606 differential methylated sites (DMSs), including 19,618 hypermethylated DMSs and 22,988 hypomethylated DMSs between TAC and sham-operated mice. The enrichment analysis of these DMSs suggested that the methylated regulation of Ras signal transduction and focal adhesion-related genes would be involved in the TAC-induced CF development. The results of bisulfite sequencing revealed that the TAC-induced methylation affected the CpG site in both of Rasal1 and Rassf1 genes, and DHI treatment remarkably downregulated the promoter methylation of Rasal1 and Rassf1 in CF hearts. Furthermore, DHI treatment upregulated the expressions of Rasal1 and Rassf1, inhibited the hyperactivity of Ras/ERK, and decreased the expressions of fibrosis-related genes. Notably, we found that DHI treatment markedly downregulated the expression of DNMT3B in CF hearts, while it did not affect the expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and TET3.  Conclusion  Aberrant DNA methylation of Rasal1 and Rassf1 genes was involved in the CF development. DHI treatment alleviated CF, prevented the hypermethylation of Rasal1 and Rassf1, and downregulated DNMT3B expression in CF hearts.
33407464/Construction and characterization of a novel glucose dehydrogenase-leucine dehydrogenase fusion enzyme for the biosynthesis of l-tert-leucine Background Biosynthesis of l-tert-leucine (l-tle), a significant pharmaceutical intermediate, by a cofactor regeneration system friendly and efficiently is a worthful goal all the time. The cofactor regeneration system of leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) has showed great coupling catalytic efficiency in the synthesis of l-tle, however the multi-enzyme complex of GDH and LeuDH has never been constructed successfully. Results In this work, a novel fusion enzyme (GDH-R3-LeuDH) for the efficient biosynthesis of l-tle was constructed by the fusion of LeuDH and GDH mediated with a rigid peptide linker. Compared with the free enzymes, both the environmental tolerance and thermal stability of GDH-R3-LeuDH had a great improved since the fusion structure. The fusion structure also accelerated the cofactor regeneration rate and maintained the enzyme activity, so the productivity and yield of l-tle by GDH-R3-LeuDH was all enhanced by twofold. Finally, the space-time yield of l-tle catalyzing by GDH-R3-LeuDH whole cells could achieve 2136 g/L/day in a 200 mL scale system under the optimal catalysis conditions (pH 9.0, 30  C, 0.4 mM of NAD+ and 500 mM of a substrate including trimethylpyruvic acid and glucose). Conclusions It is the first report about the fusion of GDH and LeuDH as the multi-enzyme complex to synthesize l-tle and reach the highest space-time yield up to now. These results demonstrated the great potential of the GDH-R3-LeuDH fusion enzyme for the efficient biosynthesis of l-tle.
33407121/Identification and characterization of regulatory pathways involved in early flowering in the new leaves of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) by transcriptome analysis Background Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is a perennial legume extensively planted throughout the world as a high nutritive value livestock forage. Flowering time is an important agronomic trait that contributes to the production of alfalfa hay and seeds. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of flowering time regulation in alfalfa are not well understood. Results In this study, an early-flowering alfalfa genotype 80 and a late-flowering alfalfa genotype 195 were characterized for the flowering phenotype. Our analysis revealed that the lower jasmonate (JA) content in new leaves and the downregulation of JA biosynthetic genes (i.e. lipoxygenase, the 12-oxophytodienoate reductase-like protein, and salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase) may play essential roles in the early-flowering phenotype of genotype 80. Further research indicated that genes encode pathogenesis-related proteins [e.g. leucine rich repeat (LRR) family proteins, receptor-like proteins, and toll-interleukin-like receptor (TIR)-nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-LRR class proteins] and members of the signaling receptor kinase family [LRR proteins, kinases domain of unknown function 26 (DUF26) and wheat leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase10 (LRK10)-like kinases] are related to early flowering in alfalfa. Additionally, those involved in secondary metabolism (2-oxoglutarate/Fe (II)-dependent dioxygenases and UDP-glycosyltransferase) and the proteasome degradation pathway [really interesting new gene (RING)/U-box superfamily proteins and F-box family proteins] are also related to early flowering in alfalfa. Conclusions Integrated phenotypical, physiological, and transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, pathogenesis-related genes, signaling receptor kinase family genes, secondary metabolism genes, and proteasome degradation pathway genes are responsible for the early flowering phenotype in alfalfa. This will provide new insights into future studies of flowering time in alfalfa and inform genetic improvement strategies for optimizing this important trait.

33407140/Characterization of type-2 diacylglycerol acyltransferases in Haematococcus lacustris reveals their functions and engineering potential in triacylglycerol biosynthesis Background Haematococcus lacustris is an ideal source of astaxanthin (AST), which is stored in oil bodies containing esterified AST (EAST) and triacylglycerol (TAG). Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) catalyze the last step of acyl-CoA-dependent TAG biosynthesis and are also considered as crucial enzymes involved in EAST biosynthesis in H. lacustris. Previous studies have identified four putative DGAT2-encoding genes in H. lacustris, and only HpDGAT2D allowed the recovery of TAG biosynthesis, but the engineering potential of HpDGAT2s in TAG biosynthesis remains ambiguous. Results Five putative DGAT2 genes (HpDGAT2A, HpDGAT2B, HpDGAT2C, HpDGAT2D, and HpDGAT2E) were identified in H. lacustris. Transcription analysis showed that the expression levels of the HpDGAT2A, HpDGAT2D, and HpDGAT2E genes markedly increased under high light and nitrogen deficient conditions with distinct patterns, which led to significant TAG and EAST accumulation. Functional complementation demonstrated that HpDGAT2A, HpDGAT2B, HpDGAT2D, and HpDGAT2E had the capacity to restore TAG synthesis in a TAG-deficient yeast strain (H1246) showing a large difference in enzymatic activity. Fatty acid (FA) profile assays revealed that HpDGAT2A, HpDGAT2D, and HpDGAT2E, but not HpDGAT2B, preferred monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs (MUFAs) for TAG synthesis in yeast cells, and showed a preference for polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs (PUFAs) based on their feeding strategy. The heterologous expression of HpDGAT2D in Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii significantly increased the TAG content and obviously promoted the MUFAs and PUFAs contents. Conclusions Our study represents systematic work on the characterization of HpDGAT2s by integrating expression patterns, AST/TAG accumulation, functional complementation, and heterologous expression in yeast, plants, and algae. These results (1) update the gene models of HpDGAT2s, (2) prove the TAG biosynthesis capacity of HpDGAT2s, (3) show the strong preference for MUFAs and PUFAs, and (4) offer target genes to modulate TAG biosynthesis by using genetic engineering methods.

33407346/A standardized polyherbal preparation POL-6 diminishes alcohol withdrawal anxiety by regulating Gabra1, Gabra2, Gabra3, Gabra4, Gabra5 gene expression of GABAA receptor signaling pathway in rats Background Alcohol abuse is a major problem worldwide and it affects people's health and economy. There is a relapse in alcohol intake due to alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal anxiety-like behavior is a symptom that appears 6-24 h after the last alcohol ingestion. Methods The present study was designed to explore the protective effect of a standardized polyherbal preparation POL-6 in ethanol withdrawal anxiety in Wistar rats. POL-6 was prepared by mixing the dried extracts of six plants Bacopa monnieri, Hypericum perforatum, Centella asiatica, Withania somnifera, Camellia sinesis, and Ocimum sanctum in the proportion 2:1:2:2:1:2 respectively. POL-6 was subjected to phytochemical profiling through LC-MS, HPLC, and HPTLC. The effect of POL-6 on alcohol withdrawal anxiety was tested using a two-bottle choice drinking paradigm model giving animals' free choice between alcohol and water for 15 days. Alcohol was withdrawn on the 16th day and POL-6 (20, 50, and 100 mg/kg, oral), diazepam (2 mg/kg) treatment was given on the withdrawal days. Behavioral parameters were tested using EPM and LDT. On the 18th day blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus of the rats and alcohol markers ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT were studied. At end of the study, animals were sacrificed and the brain was isolated for exploring the influences of POL-6 on the mRNA expression of GABAA receptor subunits in the amygdala and hippocampus. Results Phytochemical profiling showed that POL-6 contains major phytoconstituents like withaferin A, quercetin, catechin, rutin, caeffic acid, and beta-sitosterol. In-vivo studies showed that POL-6 possesses an antianxiety effect in alcohol withdrawal. Gene expression studies on the isolated brain tissues showed that POL-6 normalizes the GABAergic transmission in the amygdala and hippocampus of the rats. Conclusion The study concludes that POL-6 may have therapeutic potential for treating ethanol-type dependence.
33407561/Association between lipoprotein cholesterol and future cardiovascular disease and mortality in older adults: a Korean nationwide longitudinal study Background Dyslipidemia is considered an independent health risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a leading cause of mortality in older adults. Despite its importance, there have been few reports on the association between lipoprotein cholesterol and future CVD and cardiovascular (CV) mortality among elderly Asians aged >= 65 years. This study investigated the association between lipoprotein cholesterol and future CVD and CV mortality in an elderly Korean population using a large nationwide sample. Methods From the cohort database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service, 62,604 adults aged >= 65 years (32,584 men and 30,020 women) were included. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were categorized by quartiles. Cox proportional hazard models and linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between the quartiles of lipoprotein cholesterol and future CV events or mortality. Results The mean follow-up period was 3.3 years. The incidence rates of ischemic heart disease and ischemic brain disease were 0.97 and 0.61 per 1,000 person-years, respectively, and the mortality rates from these diseases were 0.22 and 0.34 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. In a completely adjusted model, high HDL-C and LDL-C levels were not associated with total CV events and CVD mortality. However, high LDL-C levels were significantly associated with a lower incidence of ischemic brain disease. Furthermore, diabetic patients with high LDL-C levels were more likely to have higher CV mortality, whereas non-smokers with high LDL-C levels were less likely to be at risk of CV events. Conclusions Neither high LDL-C nor HDL-C levels were significantly associated with future CV mortality in older adults aged >= 65 years. High LDL-C levels do not seem to be a risk factor for CVD in elderly individuals, and further studies are required.
33413399/Whole genome sequencing and metabolomics analyses reveal the biosynthesis of nerol in a multi-stress-tolerant Meyerozyma guilliermondii GXDK6 Background Nerol (C10H18O), an acyclic monoterpene, naturally presents in plant essential oils, and is used widely in food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as the valuable fragrance. Meanwhile, chemical synthesis is the only strategy for large-scale production of nerol, and the disadvantages of chemical synthesis greatly limit the production and its application. These defects drive the interests of researchers shift to the production of nerol by eco-friendly methods known as biosynthesis methods. However, the main technical bottleneck restricting the biosynthesis of nerol is the lacking of corresponding natural aroma-producing microorganisms. Results In this study, a novel multi-stress-tolerant probiotics Meyerozyma guilliermondii GXDK6 with aroma-producing properties was identified by whole genome sequencing and metabolomics technology. GXDK6 showed a broad pH tolerance in the range of 2.5-10.0. The species also showed salt tolerance with up to 12% NaCl and up to 18% of KCl or MgCl2. GXDK6 exhibited heavy-metal Mn2+ tolerance of up to 5494 ppm. GXDK6 could also ferment with a total of 21 kinds of single organic matter as the carbon source, and produce abundant aromatic metabolites. Results from the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated the production of 8-14 types of aromatic metabolites (isopentanol, nerol, geraniol, phenylethanol, isobutanol, etc.) when GXDK6 was fermented up to 72 h with glucose, sucrose, fructose, or xylose as the single carbon source. Among them, nerol was found to be a novel aromatic metabolite from GXDK6 fermentation, and its biosynthesis mechanism had also been further revealed. Conclusion A novel aroma-producing M. guilliermondii GXDK6 was identified successfully by whole genome sequencing and metabolomics technology. GXDK6 showed high multi-stress-tolerant properties with acid-base, salty, and heavy-metal environments. The aroma-producing mechanism of nerol in GXDK6 had also been revealed. These findings indicated the aroma-producing M. guilliermondii GXDK6 with multi-stress-tolerant properties has great potential value in the fermentation industry.  
33407145/Metabolic acclimation supports higher aluminium-induced secretion of citrate and malate in an aluminium-tolerant hybrid clone of Eucalyptus Background Eucalyptus is the main plantation wood species, mostly grown in aluminized acid soils. To understand the response of Eucalyptus clones to aluminum (Al) toxicity, the Al-tolerant Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla clone GL-9 (designated "G9") and the Al-sensitive E. urophylla clone GL-4 (designated "W4") were employed to investigate the production and secretion of citrate and malate by roots. Results Eucalyptus seedlings in hydroponics were exposed to the presence or absence of 4.4 mM Al at pH 4.0 for 24 h. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHM) and anion channel blocker phenylglyoxal (PG) were applied to explore possible pathways involved in organic acid secretion. The secretion of malate and citrate was earlier and greater in G9 than in W4, corresponding to less Al accumulation in G9. The concentration of Al in G9 roots peaked after 1 h and decreased afterwards, corresponding with a rapid induction of malate secretion. A time-lag of about 6 h in citrate efflux in G9 was followed by robust secretion to support continuous Al-detoxification. Malate secretion alone may alleviate Al toxicity because the peaks of Al accumulation and malate secretion were simultaneous in W4, which did not secrete appreciable citrate. Enhanced activities of citrate synthase (CS) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), and reduced activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), aconitase (ACO) and malic enzyme (ME) were closely associated with the greater secretion of citrate in G9. PG effectively inhibited citrate and malate secretion in both Eucalyptus clones. CHM also inhibited malate and citrate secretion in G9, and citrate secretion in W4, but notably did not affect malate secretion in W4. Conclusions G9 immediately secrete malate from roots, which had an initial effect on Al-detoxification, followed by time-delayed citrate secretion. Pre-existing anion channel protein first contributed to malate secretion, while synthesis of carrier protein appeared to be needed for citrate excretion. The changes of organic acid concentrations in response to Al can be achieved by enhanced CS and PEPC activities, but was supported by changes in the activities of other enzymes involved in organic acid metabolism. The above information may help to further explore genes related to Al-tolerance in Eucalyptus.
33407536/First detection of a plasmid-encoded New-Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) producing Acinetobacter baumannii using whole genome sequencing, isolated in a clinical setting in Benin Background Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is considered a top priority pathogen by the World Health Organization for combatting increasing antibiotic resistance and development of new drugs. Since it was originally reported in Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2009, the quick spread of the blaNDM-1 gene encoding a New-Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is increasingly recognized as a serious threat. This gene is usually carried by large plasmids and has already been documented in diverse bacterial species, including A. baumannii. Here, we report the first detection of a NDM-1-producing A. baumannii strain isolated in Benin. Case presentation A 31-year-old woman was admitted to a surgical unit with a diagnosis of post-cesarean hematoma. An extensively-drug resistant A. baumannii strain solely susceptible to amikacin, colistin and ciprofloxacin, and resistant to several other antibiotics including ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidime/avibactam, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, was isolated from the wound. Production of NDM-1 was demonstrated by immunochromatographic testing. Whole genome sequencing of the isolate confirmed the presence of blaNDM-1, but also antibiotic resistance genes against multiple beta-lactamases and other classes of antibiotics, in addition to several virulence genes. Moreover, the blaNDM-1 gene was found to be present in a Tn125 transposon integrated on a plasmid. Conclusions The discovery of this extensively-drug resistant A. baumannii strain carrying blaNDM-1 in Benin is worrying, especially because of its high potential risk of horizontal gene transfer due to being integrated into a transposon located on a plasmid. Strict control and prevention measures should be taken, once NDM-1 positive A. baumannii has been identified to prevent transfer of this resistance gene to other Enterobacterales. Capacity building is required by governmental agencies to provide suitable antibiotic treatment options and strategies, in combination with strengthening laboratory services for detection and surveillance of this pathogen.
33407116/CRISPR-Cas9 multiplex genome editing of the hydroxyproline-O-galactosyltransferase gene family alters arabinogalactan-protein glycosylation and function in Arabidopsis Background Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a class of hydroxyproline-rich proteins (HRGPs) that are heavily glycosylated (> 90%) with type II arabinogalactans (AGs). AGPs are implicated in various plant growth and development processes including cell expansion, somatic embryogenesis, root and stem growth, salt tolerance, hormone signaling, male and female gametophyte development, and defense. To date, eight Hyp-O-galactosyltransferases (GALT2-6, HPGT1-3) have been identified; these enzymes are responsible for adding the first sugar, galactose, onto AGPs. Due to gene redundancy among the GALTs, single or double galt genetic knockout mutants are often not sufficient to fully reveal their biological functions. Results Here, we report the successful application of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing/multiplexing technology to generate higher-order knockout mutants of five members of the GALT gene family (GALT2-6). AGPs analysis of higher-order galt mutants (galt2 galt5, galt3 galt4 galt6, and galt2 galt3 galt4 galt5 gal6) demonstrated significantly less glycosylated AGPs in rosette leaves, stems, and siliques compared to the corresponding wild-type organs. Monosaccharide composition analysis of AGPs isolated from rosette leaves revealed significant decreases in arabinose and galactose in all the higher-order galt mutants. Phenotypic analyses revealed that mutation of two or more GALT genes was able to overcome the growth inhibitory effect of beta-D-Gal-Yariv reagent, which specifically binds to beta-1,3-galactan backbones on AGPs. In addition, the galt2 galt3 galt4 galt5 gal6 mutant exhibited reduced overall growth, impaired root growth, abnormal pollen, shorter siliques, and reduced seed set. Reciprocal crossing experiments demonstrated that galt2 galt3 galt4 galt5 gal6 mutants had defects in the female gametophyte which were responsible for reduced seed set. Conclusions Our CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing/multiplexing approach provides a simpler and faster way to generate higher-order mutants for functional characterization compared to conventional genetic crossing of T-DNA mutant lines. Higher-order galt mutants produced and characterized in this study provide insight into the relationship between sugar decorations and the various biological functions attributed to AGPs in plants.

33407136/Cloning and characterization of KoOsmotin from mangrove plant Kandelia obovata under cold stress Background Low temperature is a major abiotic stress that seriously limits mangrove productivity and distribution. Kandelia obovata is the most cold-resistance specie in mangrove plants, but little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying its resistance to cold. Osmotin is a key protein associated with abiotic and biotic stress response in plants but no information about this gene in K. obovata was reported. Results In this study, a cDNA sequence encoding osmotin, KoOsmotin (GenBank accession no. KP267758), was cloned from mangrove plant K. obovata. The KoOsmotin protein was composed of 221 amino acids and showed a calculated molecular mass of 24.11 kDa with pI 4.92. The KoOsmotin contained sixteen cysteine residues and an N-terminal signal peptide, which were common signatures to most osmotins and pathogenesis-related 5 proteins. The three-dimensional (3D) model of KoOsmotin, contained one alpha-helix and eleven beta-strands, was formed by three characteristic domains. Database comparisons of the KoOsmotin showed the closest identity (55.75%) with the osmotin 34 from Theobroma cacao. The phylogenetic tree also revealed that the KoOsmotin was clustered in the branch of osmotin/OLP (osmotin-like protien). The KoOsmotin protein was proved to be localized to both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm by the subcellular localization analysis. Gene expression showed that the KoOsmotin was induced primarily and highly in the leaves of K. obovata, but less abundantly in stems and roots. The overexpressing of KoOsmotin conferred cold tolerance in Escherichia coli cells. Conclusion As we known, this is the first study to explore the osmotin of K. obovata. Our study provided valuable clues for further exploring the function of KoOsmotin response to stress.
33407144/Integrated analysis of DNA methylome and transcriptome reveals epigenetic regulation of CAM photosynthesis in pineapple Background Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis is an important carbon fixation pathway especially in arid environments because it leads to higher water-use efficiency compared to C3 and C4 plants. However, the role of DNA methylation in regulation CAM photosynthesis is not fully understood. Results Here, we performed temporal DNA methylome and transcriptome analysis of non-photosynthetic (white base) and photosynthetic (green tip) tissues of pineapple leaf. The DNA methylation patterns and levels in these two tissues were generally similar for the CG and CHG cytosine sequence contexts. However, CHH methylation was reduced in white base leaf tissue compared with green tip tissue across diel time course in both gene and transposon regions. We identified thousands of local differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between green tip and white base at different diel periods. We also showed that thousands of genes that overlapped with DMRs were differentially expressed between white base and green tip leaf tissue across diel time course, including several important CAM pathway-related genes, such as beta-CA, PEPC, PPCK, and MDH. Conclusions Together, these detailed DNA methylome and transcriptome maps provide insight into DNA methylation changes and enhance our understanding of the relationships between DNA methylation and CAM photosynthesis.

33407138/The role of JrPPOs in the browning of walnut explants Background Tissue culture is an effective method for the rapid breeding of seedlings and improving production efficiency, but explant browning is a key limiting factor of walnut tissue culture. Specifically, the polymerization of PPO-derived quinones that cause explant browning of walnut is not well understood. This study investigated explants of 'Zanmei' walnut shoot apices cultured in agar (A) or vermiculite (V) media, and the survival percentage, changes in phenolic content, POD and PPO activity, and JrPPO expression in explants were studied to determine the role of PPO in the browning of walnut explants. Results The results showed that the V media greatly reduced the death rate of explants, and 89.9 and 38.7% of the explants cultured in V media and A media survived, respectively. Compared with that of explants at 0 h, the PPO of explants cultured in A was highly active throughout the culture, but activity in those cultured in V remained low. The phenolic level of explants cultured in A increased significantly at 72 h but subsequently declined, and the content in the explants cultured in V increased to a high level only at 144 h. The POD in explants cultured in V showed high activity that did not cause browning. Gene expression assays showed that the expression of JrPPO1 was downregulated in explants cultured in both A and V. However, the expression of JrPPO2 was upregulated in explants cultured in A throughout the culture and upregulated in V at 144 h. JrPPO expression analyses in different tissues showed that JrPPO1 was highly expressed in stems, young leaves, mature leaves, catkins, pistils, and hulls, and JrPPO2 was highly expressed in mature leaves and pistils. Moreover, browning assays showed that both explants in A and leaf tissue exhibited high JrPPO2 activity. Conclusion The rapid increase in phenolic content caused the browning and death of explants. V media delayed the rapid accumulation of phenolic compounds in walnut explants in the short term, which significantly decreased explants mortality. The results suggest that JrPPO2 plays a key role in the oxidation of phenols in explants after branch injury.

33407412/Curcumin protects radiation-induced liver damage in rats through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway Background Curcumin has been demonstrated to exert anti-oxidant, anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. This study was conducted to observe the effect and inner mechanism of curcumin in rats with radiation-induced liver damage (RILD). Methods Thirty SD rats were classified into Control, Radiation group and Curcumin (Cur) + Radiation group (n = 10 in each group). The changes in body weight of the rats were observed on the 3rd, 7th and 14th days after the treatment with curcumin. On the 14th day post treatment, the heart blood of the rats was drawn for measurement of liver function indices including total protein (TP), alanine aminotransfetase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as aspartate aminotransfetase (AST). Subsequently, the rats were euthanized and liver tissues were taken to observe liver morphological changes using hematoxylin-eosin (HE), and to analyze apoptosis condition using transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Meanwhile, the oxidative stress level in liver tissue homogenate was determined by biochemical analysis. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway-associated and apoptosis-associated proteins was detected using Western blot analysis, and the expression levels of inflammatory factors were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The reduced body weight was observed in rats of the Radiation group compared to the Control and Cur + Radiation groups on day 14. In the Radiation group, hepatic cell edema and inflammatory cell infiltration could be visible under the light microscope, and the hepatocytes presented with vacuolar degeneration. In the Cur + Radiation group, the hepatocytes swelled under the microscope, but the pathological changes were alleviated in comparison with the Radiation group. RILD rats with curcumin treatment presented with decreased ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, and maleicdialdehyde (MDA) levels, and elevated TP, superoxide dismutase (SOD), caspase activated DNase (CAD) and glutathione (GSH) levels. Apoptosis and inflammation in rats with RILD were up-regulated, and the NF-kappaB pathway was activated, but they were reversed after continuously intragastric administration of curcumin for 14 days. Conclusion Our study highlights that curcumin treatment reduces the liver damage caused by radiation through the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway.

33407118/The apple MdCOP1-interacting protein 1 negatively regulates hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin biosynthesis Background In plants, CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) is a key negative regulator in photoperiod response. However, the biological function of COP1-interacting protein 1 (CIP1) and the regulatory mechanism of the CIP1-COP1 interaction are not fully understood. Results Here, we identified the apple MdCIP1 gene based on the Arabidopsis AtCIP1 gene. Expression pattern analysis showed that MdCIP1 was constitutively expressed in various tissues of apple, and responded to stress and hormone signals at the transcriptional level. Ectopic expression of MdCIP1 complemented the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis cip1 mutant, and MdCIP1 inhibited anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple calli. In addition, the biochemical assay demonstrated that MdCIP1 could interact with MdCOP1 protein by their coiled-coil domain, and MdCIP1-OX/cop1-4 had a similar phenotype in photomorphogenesis with the cop1-4 mutant, suggesting that COP1 is epistatic to CIP1. Furthermore, the transient transformation assay indicated that MdCIP1 repressed anthocyanin biosynthesis in an MdCOP1-mediated pathway. Conclusion Take together, this study finds that MdCIP1 acts as a repressor in regulating hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin biosynthesis through MdCOP1 in apple.
33411832/Modification of insulin amyloid aggregation by Zr phthalocyanines functionalized with dehydroacetic acid derivatives Amyloid fibrils are widely studied both as target in conformational disorders and as basis for the development of protein-based functional materials. The three Zr phthalocyanines bearing dehydroacetic acid residue (PcZr(L1)2) and its condensed derivatives (PcZr(L2)2 and PcZr(L3)2) as out-of-plane ligands were synthesized and their influence on insulin fibril formation was studied by amyloid-sensitive fluorescent dye based assay, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescent and absorption spectroscopies. The presence of Zr phthalocyanines was shown to modify the fibril formation. The morphology of fibrils formed in the presence of the Zr phthalocyanines differs from that of free insulin and depends on the structure of out-of-plane ligands. It is shown that free insulin mostly forms fibril clusters with the length of about 0.3-2.1 mum. The presence of Zr phthalocyanines leads to the formation of individual 0.4-2.8 mum-long fibrils with a reduced tendency to lateral aggregation and cluster formation (PcZr(L1)2), shorter 0.2-1.5 mum-long fibrils with the tendency to lateral aggregation without clusters (PcZr(L2)2), and fibril-like 0.2-1.0 mum-long structures (PcZr(L3)2). The strongest influence on fibrils morphology made by PcZr(L3)2 could be explained by the additional stacking of phenyl moiety of the ligand with aromatic amino acids in protein. The evidences of binding of studied Zr phthalocyanines to mature fibrils were shown by absorption spectroscopy (for PcZr(L1)2 and PcZr(L2)2) and fluorescent spectroscopy (for PcZr(L3)2). These complexes could be potentially used as external tools allowing the development of functional materials on protein fibrils basis.
33411772/Influence of L-lactate and low glucose concentrations on the metabolism and the toxin formation of Clostridioides difficile The virulence of Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) is mainly caused by its two toxins A and B. Their formation is significantly regulated by metabolic processes. Here we investigated the influence of various sugars (glucose, fructose, mannose, trehalose), sugar derivatives (mannitol and xylitol) and L-lactate on toxin synthesis. Fructose, mannose, trehalose, mannitol and xylitol in the growth medium resulted in an up to 2.2-fold increase of secreted toxin. Low glucose concentration of 2 g/L increased the toxin concentration 1.4-fold compared to growth without glucose, while high glucose concentrations in the growth medium (5 and 10 g/L) led to up to 6.6-fold decrease in toxin formation. Transcriptomic and metabolic investigation of the low glucose effect pointed towards an inactive CcpA and Rex regulatory system. L-lactate (500 mg/L) significantly reduced extracellular toxin formation. Transcriptome analyses of the later process revealed the induction of the lactose utilization operon encoding lactate racemase (larA), electron confurcating lactate dehydrogenase (CDIF630erm_01321) and the corresponding electron transfer flavoprotein (etfAB). Metabolome analyses revealed L-lactate consumption and the formation of pyruvate. The involved electron confurcation process might be responsible for the also observed reduction of the NAD+/NADH ratio which in turn is apparently linked to reduced toxin release from the cell.
33411826/Acute high folic acid treatment in SH-SY5Y cells with and without MTHFR function leads to gene expression changes in epigenetic modifying enzymes, changes in epigenetic marks, and changes in dendritic spine densities Epigenetics are known to be involved in various disorders, including neurobiological disorders like autism. Dietary factors such as folic acid can affect epigenetic marks using methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to metabolize folic acid to a one-carbon methyl group. As MTHFR mutations are frequent, it is curious as to whether excess folic acid, with or without functioning MTHFR, could affect gene expression, epigenetics, and neuromorphology. Here, we investigated gene expression and activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes, genome-wide DNA methylation, histone 3 modifications, and dendritic spine densities in SH-SY5Y cells with or without a knockdown of MTHFR and with or without an excess of folic acid. We found alterations to gene expression of epigenetic modifying enzymes, including those associated with disorders like autism. Grouping the epigenetic modifying enzymes by function indicated that gene expression was widely affected for genes that code for enzymes affecting DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, histone phosphorylation, and histone ubiquitination when excess folic acid treatment occurred with or without the knockdown of MTHFR. MTHFR was significantly reduced upon excess folic acid treatment whether MTHFR was knocked-down or not. Further, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 expression was significantly decreased with excess folic acid treatment with and without proper MTHFR expression. Global DNA methylation decreased due to the knockdown alone while global hydroxymethylated DNA increased due to the knockdown alone. TET2 expression significantly increased with the MTHFR knockdown alone. Excess folic acid alone induced a decrease in TET3 expression. Excess folic acid induced an increase in dendritic spines without the MTHFR knockdown, but folic acid induced a decrease in dendritic spines when MTHFR was knocked-down. The knockdown alone also increased the dendritic spines significantly. Histone 3 acetylation at lysine 18 was significantly increased when excess folic acid was applied to cells with the MTHFR knockdown, as was histone 3 phosphorylation at serine 10. Broadly, our results indicate that excess folic acid, even with functioning MTHFR, could have detrimental effects on cells.
33412572/Impaired cholesterol metabolism in the mouse model of cystic fibrosis. A preliminary study This study aims to investigate cholesterol metabolism in a mouse model with cystic fibrosis (CF) by the comparison of affected homozygous versus wild type (WT) mice. In particular, we evaluated the effects of a diet enriched with cholesterol in both mice groups in comparison with the normal diet. To this purpose, beyond serum and liver cholesterol, we analyzed serum phytosterols as indirect markers of intestinal absorption of cholesterol, liver lathosterol as indirect marker of de novo cholesterol synthesis, liver cholestanol (a catabolite of bile salts synthesis) and the liver mRNA levels of LDL receptor (LDLR), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR), acyl CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase 2 (ACAT2), cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). CF mice showed lower intestinal absorption and higher liver synthesis of cholesterol than WT mice. In WT mice, the cholesterol supplementation inhibits the synthesis of liver cholesterol and enhances its catabolism, while in CF mice we did not observe a reduction of LDLR and HMG-CoAR expression (probably due to an altered feed-back), causing an increase of intracellular cholesterol. In addition, we observed a further increase (5-fold) in TNFalpha mRNA levels. This preliminary study suggests that in CF mice there is a vicious circle in which the altered synthesis/secretion of bile salts may reduce the digestion/absorption of cholesterol. As a result, the liver increases the biosynthesis of cholesterol that accumulates in the cells, triggering inflammation and further compromising the metabolism of bile salts.
33488931/Protective Effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate in Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Oxidative Damage in Chicken Lymphocytes Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the fundamental compounds in green tea. The present study was to evaluate the protective effect of EGCG in oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in chicken lymphocytes. Results showed that preincubation of lymphocytes with EGCG significantly decreased H2O2-reduced cell viability and apoptotic cells with DNA damage, restored the H2O2-dependent reduction in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and suppressed the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthesis (NOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO), and protein carbonyl (Carbonyl). In addition, preincubation of the cells with EGCG increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reduced calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) load. The protective effect of EGCG in oxidative damage in lymphocytes was accompanied by mRNA expression of SOD, Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Catalase (CAT), GSH-PX, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1). As EGCG had been removed before lymphocytes were challenged with H2O2, the activation of genes such as Nrf2 and Trx-1 by preincubation with EGCG could be the main reason for EGCG to protect the cells from oxidative damage by H2O2. Since oxidative stress is an important mechanism of biological damage and is regarded as the reasons of several pathologies, the present findings may be helpful for the use of tea products to prevent oxidative stress and maintain healthy in both humans and animals.
33488941/Neuroprotection Effect of Astragaloside IV from 2-DG-Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Objective  Astragaloside IV shows neuroprotective activity, but its mechanism remains unclear. To investigate whether astragaloside IV protects from endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), we focus on the regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by astragaloside IV in neuronal cell PC12.  Methods and Results  PC12 cells treated with different concentrations of ERS inductor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) (25-500 muM) showed a significant increase of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP 78) and GRP 94 expressions and a decrease of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) fluorescence intensity and mitochondrial membrane potential ( Psim), with the peak effect seen at 50 muM, indicating that 2-DG induces ERS and the mPTP opening. Similarly, 50 muM of astragaloside IV increased the GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9 most significantly. Next, we examined the neuroprotection of astragaloside IV by dividing the PC12 cells into control group, 2-DG treatment group, astragaloside IV plus 2-DG treatment group, and astragaloside IV only group. PC12 cells treated with 50 muM 2-DG for different time courses (0-36 hr) showed a significant increase of Cleaved-Caspase-3 with the peak at 6 hr. 2-DG significantly induced cell apoptosis and increased the green fluorescence intensity of Annexin V-FITC, and these effects were reversed by astragaloside IV. Such a result indicates that astragaloside IV protected neural cell survival from ERS. 2-DG treatment significantly increased the expressions of inositol-requiring ER-to-nucleus signal kinase 1 (IRE1), phosphor-protein kinase R-like ER kinase (p-PERK), but not affect the transcription factor 6 (ATF6) expression. 2-DG treatment significantly decreased the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and significantly reduced the TMRE fluorescence intensity and  Psim, following mPTP open. Astragaloside IV significantly inhibited the above effects caused by 2-DG, except the upregulation of ATF6 protein. Taken together, astragaloside IV significantly inhibited the ERS caused by 2-DG.  Conclusion  Our data suggested that astragaloside IV protects PC12 cells from ERS by inactivation of GSK-3beta and preventing the mPTP opening. The GRP 78, GRP 94, IRE1, and PERK signaling pathways but not ATF6 are responsible for GSK-3beta inactivation and neuroprotection by astragaloside IV.
33488939/Hydrogen Sulfide Protects Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells from Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis and Affects Autophagy Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness among the elderly. AMD is characterized by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell dysfunction. However, the pathogenesis of AMD is still unclear, and there is currently no effective treatment. Accumulated evidence indicates that oxidative stress and autophagy play a crucial role in the development of AMD. H2S is an antioxidant that can directly remove intracellular superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide. The purpose of this study is to investigate the antioxidative effect of H2S in RPE cells and its role in autophagy. The results show that exogenous H2S (NaHS) pretreatment effectively reduces H2O2-induced oxidative stress, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and inflammation in ARPE-19 cells. NaHS pretreatment also decreased autophagy levels raised by H2O2, increased cell viability, and ameliorated cell morphological damage. Interestingly, the suppression of autophagy by its inhibitor 3-MA showed an increase of cell viability, amelioration of morphology, and a decrease of apoptosis. In summary, oxidative stress causes ARPE-19 cell injury by inducing cell autophagy. However exogenous H2S is shown to attenuate ARPE-19 cell injury, decrease apoptosis, and reduce the occurrence of autophagy-mediated by oxidative stress. These findings suggest that autophagy might play a crucial role in the development of AMD, and exogenous H2S has a potential value in the treatment of AMD.
33488926/Melatonin Protects Goat Spermatogonial Stem Cells against Oxidative Damage during Cryopreservation by Improving Antioxidant Capacity and Inhibiting Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the only adult stem cells that pass genes to the next generation and can be used in assisted reproductive technology and stem cell therapy. SSC cryopreservation is an important method for the preservation of immature male fertility. However, freezing increases the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes oxidative damage to SSCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on goat SSCs during cryopreservation and to explore its protective mechanism. We obtained SSCs from dairy goat testes by two-step enzymatic digestion and differential plating. The SSCs were cryopreserved with freezing media containing different melatonin concentrations. The results showed that 10-6 M of melatonin increased significantly the viability, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and mitochondrial membrane potential of frozen-thawed SSCs, while it reduced significantly the ROS level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content (P < 0.05). Further analysis was performed by western blotting, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Melatonin improved significantly the enzyme activity and protein expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (P < 0.05), thereby activating the antioxidant defense system of SSCs. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited significantly the expression of proapoptotic protein (Bax) and increased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) (P < 0.05). The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway analysis showed that the addition of melatonin reduced significantly the mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation, and inhibited the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, thereby preventing the activation of caspase-3 (P < 0.05) and inhibiting SSC apoptosis. In addition, melatonin reduced significantly the autophagosome formation and regulated the expression of autophagy-related proteins (LC3-I, LC3-II, P62, Beclin1, and ATG7) (P < 0.05), thereby reversing the freeze-induced excessive autophagy. In summary, melatonin protected goat SSCs during cryopreservation via antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and autophagic regulation.
33488937/Ophiopogonin D Increases SERCA2a Interaction with Phospholamban by Promoting CYP2J3 Upregulation Ophiopogonin D (OPD), a compound from the Chinese herb Radix Ophiopogonis, reportedly induces increased levels of cytochrome P450 2J3 (CYP2J3)/epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and Ca2+ in rat cardiomyocytes. Little is known regarding the specific mechanism between CYP2J3 and Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we investigated whether CYP2J3 is involved in the protective action of OPD on the myocardium by activating the Ca2+ homeostasis-related protein complex (SERCA2a and PLB) in H9c2 rat cardiomyoblast cells. The interaction between SERCA2a and PLB was measured using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. OPD attenuated heart failure and catalyzed the active transport of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by inducing the phosphorylation of PLB and promoting the SERCA2a activity. These beneficial effects of OPD on heart failure were abolished after knockdown of CYP2J3 in a model of heart failure. Together, our results identify CYP2J3 as a critical intracellular target for OPD and unravel a mechanism of CYP2J3-dependent regulation of intracellular Ca2+.
33488936/Dioscin Improves Pyroptosis in LPS-Induced Mice Mastitis by Activating AMPK/Nrf2 and Inhibiting the NF-kappaB Signaling Pathway Dioscin, a natural steroid saponin, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, but its protective mechanism against mastitis is still unknown. NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis play important roles in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including mastitis. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of dioscin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced mastitis in vivo and in vitro and its mechanism of action. In vivo experiments, dioscin can reduce the inflammatory lesions and neutrophil motility in mammary tissue. Moreover, dioscin also can reduce the production of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-induced mice mastitis. In vitro experiments, the results showed that dioscin inhibited the inflammatory response and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, but the survival rate of mouse mammary epithelial cells (mMECs) induced by LPS+ATP is increased. Subsequently, the experiment convinces that dioscin can reduce LPS+ATP-induced mMEC pyroptosis by adding Ac-DEVD-CHO (a caspase-3 inhibitor). Further mechanistic studies demonstrate that dioscin can activate AMPK/Nrf2 to inhibit NLRP3/GSDMD-induced mMEC pyroptosis. In summary, this paper reveals a novel function of dioscin on mMEC pyroptosis and provides a new potential therapy of dioscin for the treatment and prevention of mastitis.
33413415/The damage and tolerance mechanisms of Phaffia rhodozyma mutant strain MK19 grown at 28  C Background  Phaffia rhodozyma has many desirable properties for astaxanthin production, including rapid heterotrophic metabolism and high cell densities in fermenter culture. The low optimal temperature range (17-21  C) for cell growth and astaxanthin synthesis in this species presents an obstacle to efficient industrial-scale astaxanthin production. The inhibition mechanism of cell growth at > 21  C in P. rhodozyma have not been investigated. Results MK19, a mutant P. rhodozyma strain grows well at moderate temperatures, its cell growth was also inhibited at 28  C, but such inhibition was mitigated, and low biomass 6 g/L was obtained after 100 h culture. Transcriptome analysis indicated that low biomass at 28  C resulted from strong suppression of DNA and RNA synthesis in MK19. Growth inhibition at 28  C was due to cell membrane damage with a characteristic of low mRNA content of fatty acid (f.a.) pathway transcripts (acc, fas1, fas2), and consequent low f.a. content. Thinning of cell wall and low mannose content (leading to loss of cell wall integrity) also contributed to reduced cell growth at 28  C in MK19. Levels of astaxanthin and ergosterol, two end-products of isoprenoid biosynthesis (a shunt pathway of f.a. biosynthesis), reached 2000 microg/g and 7500 microg/g respectively; ~2-fold higher than levels at 21 or 25  C. Abundance of ergosterol, an important cell membrane component, compensated for lack of f.a., making possible the biomass production of 6 g/L for MK19 at 28  C. Conclusions Inhibition of growth of P. rhodozyma at 28  C results from blocking of DNA, RNA, f.a., and cell wall biosynthesis. In MK19, abundant ergosterol made possible biomass production 6 g/L at 28  C. Significant accumulation of astaxanthin and ergosterol indicated an active MVA pathway in MK19 at 28  C. Strengthening of the MVA pathway can be a feasible metabolic engineering approach for enhancement of astaxanthin synthesis in P. rhodozyma. The present findings provide useful mechanistic insights regarding adaptation of P. rhodozyma to 28  C, and improved understanding of feasible metabolic engineering techniques for industrial scale astaxanthin production by this economically important yeast species.
33413112/Comparative analysis of powdery mildew resistant and susceptible cultivated cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) varieties to reveal the metabolic responses to Sphaerotheca fuliginea infection Background Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a widely planted vegetable crop that suffers from various pathogen infections. Powdery mildew (PM) is typical disease caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea infection and destroys the production of cucumber. However, the metabolic responses to S. fuliginea infection are largely unknown. Results In our study, a PM resistant variety 'BK2' and a susceptible variety 'H136' were used to screen differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under S. fuliginea infection. Most of DEGs and DAMs were enriched in several primary and secondary metabolic pathways, including flavonoid, hormone, fatty acid and diterpenoid metabolisms. Our data showed that many flavonoid-related metabolites were significantly accumulated in BK2 rather than H136, suggesting an essential role of flavonoids in formation of resistant quality. Changes in expression of CYP73A, CYP81E1, CHS, F3H, HCT and F3'M genes provided a probable explanation for the differential accumulation of flavonoid-related metabolites. Interestingly, more hormone-related DEGs were detected in BK2 compared to H136, suggesting a violent response of hormone signaling pathways in the PM-resistant variety. The number of fatty acid metabolism-related DAMs in H136 was larger than that in BK2, indicating an active fatty acid metabolism in the PM-susceptible variety. Conclusions Many differentially expressed transcription factor genes were identified under S. fuliginea infection, providing some potential regulators for the improvement of PM resistance. PM resistance of cucumber was controlled by a complex network consisting of various hormonal and metabolic pathways.
33413291/Pharmacokinetics of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone furoate administered as an inhaled fixed-dose combination in Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects Background A once-daily (o.d.) fixed-dose combination of indacaterol acetate (IND), glycopyrronium bromide (GLY), and mometasone furoate (MF) delivered via the Breezhaler  device (IND/GLY/MF) is being developed for treatment of asthma. This study compared steady-state pharmacokinetics of IND, GLY and MF between Japanese and Caucasian male subjects after multiple inhalations of IND/GLY/MF o.d. Methods This was a single-center, open-label, 2-treatment crossover study with a 21-day washout period. Japanese and Caucasian subjects received IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 mug (inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] medium-dose) or 150/50/160 mug o.d. (ICS high-dose) for 14 days in each period. Pharmacokinetics were characterized up to 24 h post-dose on Days 1 and 14. Results In total, 16 Japanese (median age 31 years [range 20-40 years], mean weight 68.3 kg) and 17 Caucasian subjects (median age 27 years [range 21-43 years], mean weight 75.0 kg) were randomized. Geometric mean ratios (Japanese/Caucasian) [90% confidence interval (CI)] for Cmax for IND, GLY and MF at the high ICS dose on Day 14 were 1.31 [1.13, 1.51] 1.38 [1.13, 1.69] and 1.07 [0.969, 1.18], respectively. Geometric mean ratios (Japanese/Caucasian) [90% CI] for AUC0-24h on Day 14 for IND, GLY and MF at the high ICS dose were 1.17 [1.01, 1.35], 1.05 [0.920, 1.20] and 1.15 [1.05, 1.27] respectively. Similar trends were noted for all components for the medium ICS dose treatment. IND/GLY/MF was safe and well tolerated; no AEs suspected to be study drug-related were observed. Conclusion Pharmacokinetics of IND, GLY and MF (high and medium dose) when delivered as a fixed-dose combination were comparable between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The IND/GLY/MF combination at the administrated doses was safe and well tolerated in both ethnic groups. Trial registration Japan Registry of Clinical Trial: jRCT2031200227, retrospectively registered on 04, December, 2020.
33413277/Piperlongumine inhibits the growth of non-small cell lung cancer cells via the miR-34b-3p/TGFBR1 pathway Background Non-small cell lung cancer is a common type of lung cancer. Piperlongumine (PL), which is extracted from the roots of piperaceae plant, long pepper, and peppercorn, is an alkaloid amide that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. However, whether it affects lung cancer cells remains unclear. Methods We assessed the effects of PL on the proliferation and apoptosis of A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines. Results PL was mildly toxic to normal human bronchial epithelial cells and significantly suppressed growth and facilitated apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells. It also upregulated microRNA (miR)-34b-3p and downregulated the transforming growth factor beta type I receptor (TGFBR1). The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that TGFBR1 is a target gene of miR-34b-3p. Silencing of miR-34b-3p or overexpression of TGFBR1 partially attenuated the effects of PL on A549 and H1299 cells.

33413372/Improved production of germacrene A, a direct precursor of ss-elemene, in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing a cyanobacterial germacrene A synthase Background The sesquiterpene germacrene A is a direct precursor of ss-elemene that is a major component of the Chinese medicinal herb Curcuma wenyujin with prominent antitumor activity. The microbial platform for germacrene A production was previously established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the germacrene A synthase (LTC2) of Lactuca sativa. Results We evaluated the performance of LTC2 (LsGAS) as well as nine other identified or putative germacrene A synthases from different sources for the production of germacrene A. AvGAS, a synthase of Anabaena variabilis, was found to be the most efficient in germacrene A production in yeast. AvGAS expression alone in S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1D already resulted in a substantial production of germacrene A while LTC2 expression did not. Further metabolic engineering the yeast using known strategies including overexpression of tHMGR1 and repression of squalene synthesis pathway led to an 11-fold increase in germacrene A production. Site-directed mutagenesis of AvGAS revealed that while changes of several residues located within the active site cavity severely compromised germacrene A production, substitution of Phe23 located on the lateral surface with tryptophan or valine led to a 35.2% and 21.8% increase in germacrene A production, respectively. Finally, the highest production titer of germacrene A reached 309.8 mg/L in shake-flask batch culture. Conclusions Our study highlights the potential of applying bacterial sesquiterpene synthases with improved performance by mutagenesis engineering in producing germacrene A.
33413456/Reliability and diagnostic performance of a new blood ketone and glucose meter in humans Background Accurate and reliable monitoring of blood ketone and glucose levels is useful for athletes adhering to a ketogenic diet who want to verify that they are in a state of ketosis and, therefore, accruing performance adaptations. However, the cost of devices and testing materials may prohibit their use. More affordable field testing systems are available, but their accuracy and reliability remain in question. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the agreement between a previously validated ketone and glucose meter (Meter 1 - Precision Xtra) and a more affordable meter that has not been validated (Meter 2 - Keto-Mojo), and also to assess the diagnostic performance of Meter 2 for identifying nutritional ketosis. Methods Thirteen participants (7 females and 6 males; 21.6 +- 3.0 years old) visited the laboratory three times in this randomized, double-blind cross-over design study. Ketone and glucose levels were measured with Meter 1 and Meter 2 twice before and twice after ingestion of a racemic ketone, natural ketone, or maltodextrin supplement. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate interrater reliability for Meter 1 and Meter 2. Bland-Altman plots were constructed to visually assess the agreement between devices. Area under the ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic ability of Meter 2 to detect nutritional ketosis at a threshold ketone level of 0.5 mM as identified by Meter 1. Results Reliability between the meters was excellent for measuring ketones (ICC = .968; .942-.981) and good for measuring glucose (ICC = .809; .642-.893), though the Bland-Altman plot revealed substantial differences in agreement for measuring glucose. Area under the ROC curve (Area = 0.913; 0.828-0.998) was excellent for diagnosing nutritional ketosis. Conclusions Both Meter 1 and Meter 2 displayed excellent agreement between each other for ketone measurement. Meter 2 also displayed an excellent level of accuracy for diagnosing nutritional ketosis at a threshold value of 0.5 mM, making it an effective and affordable alternative to more expensive testing devices.
33413302/Vochysia tucanorum Mart. butanol fraction presents antitumoral activity in vivo and prevents the installation of cachexia in solid Ehrlich tumor model Background Cancer is a multifactorial disease caused by uncontrolled proliferation of cells. About 50-80% of cancer patients develop cachexia, a complex metabolic syndrome associated with an increase of mortality and morbidity. However, there are no effective therapies in medical clinic for cancer cachexia. Vochysia tucanorum Mart. is a common three of the Brazilian "Cerrado". The butanolic fraction of V. tucanorum (Fr-BuVt), very rich in triterpenes with various biological activities, might be interesting in being tested in cancer cachexia syndrome. Hence, the present study was undertaken to investigate the antitumoral activity of Fr-BuVt and its potential against cachexia development. Methods Ehrlich tumor was used as model of cancer cachexia. Ascitic Ehrlich tumor cells were collected, processed and inoculated subcutaneously in saline solution (1 x 107/100 mul; >=95% viability) for the obtention of solid Ehrlich carcinoma. After inoculation, solid Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice were treated by 14 consecutive days by gavage with Fr-BuVt (200 mg/kg). Body weight and tumor volume were measure during the treatment period. Tumors were removed, weighed and properly processed to measure the content and phosphorylation levels of key-proteins involved to apoptotic and proliferation process by Western Blot. Muscles and adipose tissues were removed for weighed. Serum was collected to cytokines levels and energetic blood markers measurements. Results The treatment with the Fr-BuVt (200 mg/kg, 14 days) decreased the solid Ehrlich tumor volume and weight besides increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins caspase-3 and BAX, but also decreased the expression of the proteins involved in proliferation NFkappaB, mTOR and ERK. In addition, our data shows that the administration of Fr-BuVt was able to prevent the installation of cancer cachexia in Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice, since prevented the loss of body weight, as well as the loss of muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, an improvement in some blood parameters such as decrease in cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels is observed. Conclusions The study revealed that Fr-BuVt has antitumoral activity and prevent installation of cancer cachexia in Ehrlich model. Therefore, Fr-BuVt may represent an alternative treatment for cancer cachexia. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12906-020-03190-1.
33413407/Effective production of human growth factors in Escherichia coli by fusing with small protein 6HFh8 Background Growth factors (GFs) are signaling proteins that affect cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and differentiation. GFs are used as cosmeceuticals, exerting anti-wrinkle, anti-aging, and whitening effects, and also as pharmaceuticals to treat wounds, growth failure, and oral mucositis. However, in mammalian and bacterial cells, low productivity and expression in inclusion bodies, respectively, of GFs does not satisfy the consumer demand. Here, we aimed to develop a bacterial expression system that produces high yields of soluble GFs that can be purified in their native forms. Results We present Fh8, an 8-kDa peptide from Fasciola hepatica with an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6HFh8), as a fusion partner for enhanced human GF production in recombinant Escherichia coli. The fusion partner harboring a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site was fused to the N-terminus of 10 human GFs: acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF, respectively), epidermal growth factor (EGF), human growth hormone (hGH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165), keratinocyte growth factor 1 (KGF-1), placental growth factor (PGF), stem cell factor (SCF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli under the control of T7 promoter at three temperatures (25  C, 30  C, and 37  C). All individual fusion proteins, except for SCF and TIMP-1, were successfully overexpressed in cytoplasmic soluble form at more than one temperature. Further, the original aFGF, IGF-1, EGF, and VEGF165 proteins were cleaved from the fusion partner by TEV protease. Five-liter fed-batch fermentation approaches for the 6HFh8-aFGF (lacking disulfide bonds) and 6HFh8-VEGF165 (a cysteine-rich protein) were devised to obtain the target protein at concentrations of 9.7 g/l and 3.4 g/l, respectively. The two GFs were successfully highly purified (> 99% purity). Furthermore, they exerted similar cell proliferative effects as those of their commercial equivalents. Conclusions We demonstrated that 6HFh8-GF fusion proteins could be overexpressed on a g/l scale in the cytoplasm of E. coli, with the GFs subsequently highly purified and maintaining their biological activity. Hence, the small protein 6HFh8 can be used for efficient mass-production of various GFs.
33413462/Essential amino acid-enriched whey enhances post-exercise whole-body protein balance during energy deficit more than iso-nitrogenous whey or a mixed-macronutrient meal: a randomized, crossover study Background The effects of ingesting varying essential amino acid (EAA)/protein-containing food formats on protein kinetics during energy deficit are undetermined. Therefore, recommendations for EAA/protein food formats necessary to optimize both whole-body protein balance and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during energy deficit are unknown. We measured protein kinetics after consuming iso-nitrogenous amounts of free-form essential amino acid-enriched whey (EAA + W; 34.7 g protein, 24 g EAA sourced from whey and free-form EAA), whey (WHEY; 34.7 g protein, 18.7 g EAA), or a mixed-macronutrient meal (MEAL; 34.7 g protein, 11.4 g EAA) after exercise during short-term energy deficit. Methods Ten adults (mean +- SD; 21 +- 4 y; 25.7 +- 1.7 kg/m2) completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study consisting of three, 5 d energy-deficit periods (- 30 +- 3% of total energy requirements), separated by 14 d. Whole-body protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance (NET) were determined at rest and in response to combination exercise consisting of load carriage treadmill walking, deadlifts, and box step-ups at the end of each energy deficit using L-[2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[2H2]-tyrosine infusions. Treatments were ingested immediately post-exercise. Mixed-muscle protein synthesis (mixed-MPS) was measured during exercise through recovery. Results Change (Delta postabsorptive + exercise to postprandial + recovery [mean treatment difference (95%CI)]) in whole-body (g/180 min) PS was 15.8 (9.8, 21.9; P = 0.001) and 19.4 (14.8, 24.0; P = 0.001) greater for EAA + W than WHEY and MEAL, respectively, with no difference between WHEY and MEAL. DeltaPB was - 6.3 (- 11.5, - 1.18; P = 0.02) greater for EAA + W than WHEY and - 7.7 (- 11.9, - 3.6; P = 0.002) greater for MEAL than WHEY, with no difference between EAA + W and MEAL. DeltaNET was 22.1 (20.5, 23.8; P = 0.001) and 18.0 (16.5, 19.5; P = 0.00) greater for EAA + W than WHEY and MEAL, respectively, while DeltaNET was 4.2 (2.7, 5.6; P = 0.001) greater for MEAL than WHEY. Mixed-MPS did not differ between treatments. Conclusions While mixed-MPS was similar across treatments, combining free-form EAA with whey promotes greater whole-body net protein balance during energy deficit compared to iso-nitrogenous amounts of whey or a mixed-macronutrient meal.

33413105/Plasma membrane vesicles from cauliflower meristematic tissue and their role in water passage Background Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) inflorescences are composed mainly of meristematic tissue, which has a high cellular proliferation. This considerable cellular density makes the inflorescence an organ with a large proportion of membranes. However, little is known about the specific role of the lipid and protein composition of the plasma membrane present in this organ. Results In this work, we analyzed the lipids and proteins present in plasma membrane from two different stages of development of cauliflower inflorescence and compared them with leaf plasma membrane. For this purpose, plasma membrane vesicles were obtained by centrifugation for each sample and the vesicular diameter and osmotic permeability (Pf) were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and the stopped-flow technique, respectively. In addition, fatty acids and sterols were analyzed by gas chromatography and HPLC. The protein composition of the inflorescences and leaves was characterized by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and the data obtained were compared with Brassicaceae proteins present in the UniProt database in relation to the presence of aquaporins determined by western blot analysis. The highest Pf value was found in 90 day inflorescences-derived plasma membrane vesicles (61.4 +- 4.14 mums- 1). For sterols and fatty acids, the concentrations varied according to the organ of origin. The protein profile revealed the presence of aquaporins from the PIP1 and PIP2 subfamilies in both inflorescences and leaves. Conclusion This study shows that the composition of the sterols, the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids, and the proteins present in the membranes analyzed give them high functionality for water passage. This represents an important addition to the limited information available in this field.

33413289/Anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities of the chloroform extract and anti-inflammatory effect of the three diterpenes isolated from Salvia ballotiflora Benth Background Drugs used for the treatment of diseases associated with chronic inflammation, such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis have the potential to cause undesirable side-effects, which might result in patients ending treatment prematurely. However, plants are a viable option for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we assessed the in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, and the antitumor effects of the chloroform extract of Salvia ballotiflora (ECL). The pro-apoptotic effects of ECL in CT26 cells were also determined. Methods The chloroform extract of Salvia ballotiflora (ECL) was standardized using 19-deoxyicetexone (DEOX) as a phytochemical marker. The anti-inflammatory activity of ECL was determined on acute and chronic inflammatory models using the TPA-induced mouse ear edema assay. The antitumor activity of ECL was evaluated by the subcutaneous inoculation of CT26 cells on the back of Balb/c mice. In vitro CT26 cell death induced by ECL was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay using flow cytometry. ECL and the diterpenes isolated from the chloroform extract included 19-deoxyicetexone (DEOX), icetexone (ICT), and 7,20-dihydroanastomosine (DAM), which were tested in LPS-stimulated J774A.1 macrophages to quantify pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The in vitro anti-arthritic activity of ECL was determined using the bovine serum protein (BSP) denaturation assay. Results ECL exerted anti-inflammatory activities in acute (84% of inhibition, 2 mg/ear) and chronic models (62.71%, at 100 mg/kg). ECL showed antitumor activity at 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, reducing tumor volume by 30 and 40%, respectively. ECL (9.5 mug/mL) induced in vitro apoptosis in CT26 cells by 29.1% (48 h of treatment) and 93.9% (72 h of treatment). ECL (10 mug/ml) decreased levels of NO (53.7%), pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (44.9%), IL-1beta (71.9%), and TNF-alpha (40.1%), but increased the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (44%). The diterpenes DEOX, ICT, and DAM decreased levels of NO (38.34, 47.63, 67.15%), IL-6 (57.84, 60.45, 44.26%), and TNF-alpha (38.90, 31.30, 32.83%), respectively. ECL showed in vitro antiarthritic activity (IC50 = 482.65 mug/mL). Conclusions ECL exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. Furthermore, the diterpenes DEOX, DAM, and ICT showed anti-inflammatory activity by reducing levels of NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6.
33413340/Ethanolic extract of Nymphaea lotus L. (Nymphaeaceae) leaves exhibits in vitro antioxidant, in vivo anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities on Jurkat and MCF-7 cancer cell lines Background Nymphaea lotus L. (N. lotus) is an aquatic plant with anecdotal reports suggesting its use in the traditional management of cancer. However, there is a paucity of data on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties of N. lotus in relation to its phytochemical and elemental contents. This study aimed at determining the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties of the hydro-ethanolic extract of N. lotus leaves (NLE), and its phenolic, flavonoid and elemental constituents. Methods The antioxidant property of NLE was determined using total phenolic and flavonoid, DPPH radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation and reducing power assays. The anti-inflammatory activity of NLE (100-250-500 mg/kg), diclofenac and hydrocortisone (positive controls) were determined by paw oedema and skin prick tests in Sprague Dawley rats. Also, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was determined by Westergren method. The macro/micro-elements content was determined by the XRF method. The cytotoxic property of NLE was determined by the MTT assay, on two cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and Jurkat) and compared to a normal cell line (Chang liver). Inhibitory concentrations were determined as IC50 values (+-SEM). Results The extract had appreciable levels of phenolic and flavonoids compounds and was two-fold more potent in scavenging DPPH radicals than Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). However, NLE was three- and six-fold less potent than ascorbic acid and BHT, respectively, in reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. The extract was six-fold more potent than gallic acid in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. The extract caused a dose-dependent decrease in rat paw oedema sizes, comparable to diclofenac, and a significant decrease in wheel diameters and ESR. The elemental analysis revealed relevant concentrations of Mg2+, P2+, S2+, K2+, Mn+, Fe+, Cu+, Zn+ and Cd+. The extract exhibited cytotoxic activity on both MCF-7 (IC50 = 155.00 mug/ml) and Jurkat (IC50 = 87.29 mug/ml), with higher selectivity for Jurkat cell line. Interestingly, the extract showed low cytotoxicity to the normal Chang liver cell line (IC50 = 204.20 mug/ml). Conclusion N. lotus leaves extract exhibited high antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer-cell-specific cytotoxic properties. These aforementioned activities could be attributed to its phenolic, flavonoid and elemental constituents. Graphical abstract
33488923/NAMPT/SIRT1 Attenuate Ang II-Induced Vascular Remodeling and Vulnerability to Hypertension by Inhibiting the ROS/MAPK Pathway Hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and rearrangement of the extracellular matrix. Besides, the pathogenesis of hypertension is closely related to excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a rate-limiting enzyme in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis that influences the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes, such as sirtuins, which possess NAD-dependent protein deacetylase activity and cleave NAD during the deacetylation cycle. Recently, NAMPT has been shown to play a crucial role in various diseases associated with oxidative stress. However, the function and regulation of NAMPT in hypertension have not been extensively explored. In the present study, we identified NAMPT as a crucial regulator of hypertension, because NAMPT expression was significantly downregulated in both patients with hypertension and experimental animals. NAMPT knockout (NAMPT+/-) mice exhibited a significantly higher blood pressure and ROS levels after stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II) than wild-type mice, and the administration of recombinant human NAMPT (rhNAMPT) reversed this effect. In vivo, overexpression of NAMPT protected against angiotensin II- (Ang II-) induced hypertension by inhibiting ROS production via sirtuin 1 in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) and mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAs). In turn, NAMPT alleviated the ROS-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, NAMPT might be a novel biomarker and a therapeutic target in hypertension.
33488933/HSP60 Regulates Monosodium Urate Crystal-Induced Inflammation by Activating the TLR4-NF-kappaB-MyD88 Signaling Pathway and Disrupting Mitochondrial Function Acute gout is an inflammatory response induced by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. HSP60 is a highly conserved stress protein that acts as a cellular "danger" signal for immune reactions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of HSP60 in gout. HSP60 expression was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of gout patients. The effect and molecular mechanism of HSP60 in gout were studied in MSU crystals treatment macrophages and C57BL/6 mice. JC-1 probe and MitoSOX Red were used to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). HSP60 expression was significantly upregulated in the PBMCs and sera of patients with acute gout (AG) compared to those with intercritical gout (IG) or healthy controls (HCs). MSU crystals induced the expression and secretion of HSP60 in the macrophages. HSP60 knockdown or overexpression affects TLR4 and MyD88 expression, IkappaBalpha degradation, and the nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in MSU crystal-stimulated inflammation. Further, HSP60 facilitates MMP collapse and mtROS production and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in MSU crystal-stimulated macrophages. In MSU crystal-induced arthritis mouse models pretreated with HSP60 vivo-morpholino, paw swelling, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and inflammatory cell infiltration significantly decreased. Our study reveals that MSU crystal stimulates the expression of HSP60, which accelerates the TLR4-MyD88-NF-kappaB signaling pathway and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction.
33413359/Norwogonin attenuates hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells Background Norwogonin is a natural flavone with three phenolic hydroxyl groups in skeletal structure and has excellent antioxidant activity. However, the neuroprotective effect of norwogonin remains unclear. Here, we investigated the protective capacity of norwogonin against oxidative damage elicited by hypoxia in PC12 cells. Methods The cell viability and apoptosis were examined by MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content was measured using DCFH-DA assay. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzyme levels were determined using commercial kits. The expression of related genes and proteins was measured by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Results We found that norwogonin alleviated hypoxia-induced injury in PC12 cells by increasing the cell viability, reducing LDH release, and ameliorating the changes of cell morphology. Norwogonin also acted as an antioxidant by scavenging ROS, reducing MDA production, maintaining the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and decreasing the expression levels of HIF-1alpha and VEGF. In addition, norwogonin prevented cell apoptosis via inhibiting the expression levels of caspase-3, cytochrome c and Bax, while increasing the expression levels of Bcl-2 and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. Conclusions Norwogonin attenuates hypoxia-induced injury in PC12 cells by quenching ROS, maintaining the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
33413326/Green coffee methanolic extract and silymarin protect against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in albino male rats Background During the last few decades, patients worldwide have been interested in using alternative medicine in treating diseases to avoid the increased side effects of chemical medications. Green coffee is unroasted coffee seeds that have higher amounts of chlorogenic acid compared to roasted coffee. Green coffee was successfully used to protect against obesity, Alzheimer disease, high blood pressure and bacterial infection. Methods This study aimed to investigate the probable protective activity of the green coffee methanolic extract, silymarin and their combination on CCl4-induced liver toxicity in male rats. Thirty Sprague - Dawley male albino rats were divided into 5 groups; control negative (G1) just got the vehicle (olive oil) and the other four groups received CCl4 dissolved in olive oil through an intraperitoneal injection and were divided into untreated control positive group (G2), the third group (G3) was treated with green coffee methanolic extract, the fourth group (G4) was treated with silymarin, and the fifth group (G5) was treated with a combination of green coffee methanolic extract and silymarin. Results In the positive control group treated with CCl4 (G2), the CCl4-induced toxicity increased lipid peroxidation, IL-6, kidney function parameters, liver function enzymes, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins, and decreased irisin, antioxidants, CYP450 and high-density lipoprotein levels. Hepatic tissues were also injured. However, treating the injured rats in G3, G4 and G5 significantly improved the altered parameters and hepatic tissues. Conclusions Green coffee methanolic extract, silymarin, and their combination succeeded in protecting the male rats against CCl4 hepatotoxicity due to their antioxidant activity. Effect of green coffee methanolic extract mixed with silymarin in G5 was more efficient than that of green coffee methanolic extract in G3 or silymarin in G4.

33413111/Integrated Transcriptomic and Metabolomic analysis reveals a transcriptional regulation network for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and flavonoids in 'Cara cara' navel Orange Background Carotenoids and flavonoids are important secondary metabolites in plants, which exert multiple bioactivities and benefits to human health. Although the genes that encode carotenogenesis and flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes are well characterized, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that are related to the pathway genes remain to be investigated. In this study, 'Cara cara' navel orange (CNO) fruit at four development stages were used to identify the key genes and TFs for carotenoids and flavonoids accumulation. Results In this study, CNO was used to investigate the profiles of carotenoids and flavonoids by a combination of metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses. The important stage for the accumulation of the major carotenoid, lycopene was found to be at 120 days after florescence (DAF). The transcripts of five carotenogenesis genes were highly correlated with lycopene contents, and 16, 40, 48, 24 and 18 transcription factors (TFs) were predicted to potentially bind 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS1), deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS2), phytoene synthase (PSY1) and lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYB) promoters, respectively. Narirutin was the most abundant flavonoid in the flesh at the early stages, 60 DAF was the most important stage for the accumulation of flavonoids, and 17, 22, 14, 25, 24 and 16 TFs could potentially bind phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL-1 and PAL-4), 4-Coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL-2 and 4CL-5), chalcone synthase (CHS-1) and chalcone isomerase (CHI) promoters, respectively. Furthermore, both sets of 15 candidate TFs might regulate at least three key genes and contribute to carotenoids/flavonoids accumulation in CNO fruit. Finally, a hierarchical model for the regulatory network among the pathway genes and TFs was proposed. Conclusions Collectively, our results suggest that DXS1, DXR, GGPPS2, PSY1 and LCYB genes were the most important genes for carotenoids accumulation, while PAL-1, PAL-4, 4CL-2, 4CL-5, CHS-1 and CHI for flavonoids biosynthesis. A total of 24 TFs were postulated as co-regulators in both pathways directly, which might play important roles in carotenoids and flavonoids accumulation in CNO fruit.

33413120/Identification of plant leaf phosphorus content at different growth stages based on hyperspectral reflectance Background Modern agriculture strives to sustainably manage fertilizer for both economic and environmental reasons. The monitoring of any nutritional (phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium) deficiency in growing plants is a challenge for precision farming technology. A study was carried out on three species of popular crops, celery (Apium graveolens L., cv. Neon), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L., cv. Tapir) and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne, cv. Honeoye), fertilized with four different doses of phosphorus (P) to deliver data for non-invasive detection of P content. Results Data obtained via biochemical analysis of the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in plant material showed that the strongest effect of P availability for plants was in the diverse total chlorophyll content in sugar beet and celery compared to that in strawberry, in which P affects a variety of carotenoid contents in leaves. The measurements performed using hyperspectral imaging, obtained in several different stages of plant development, were applied in a supervised classification experiment. A machine learning algorithm (Backpropagation Neural Network, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) was developed to classify plants from four variants of P fertilization. The lowest prediction accuracy was obtained for the earliest measured stage of plant development. Statistical analyses showed correlations between leaf biochemical constituents, phosphorus fertilization and the mass of the leaf/roots of the plants. Conclusions Obtained results demonstrate that hyperspectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence methods has potential for non-invasive detection of non-homogenous phosphorus fertilization on crop levels.

33413459/Caffeine increases maximal fat oxidation during a graded exercise test: is there a diurnal variation? Background There is evidence that caffeine increases the maximal fat oxidation rate (MFO) and aerobic capacity, which are known to be lower in the morning than in the afternoon. This paper examines the effect of caffeine intake on the diurnal variation of MFO during a graded exercise test in active men. Methods Using a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experimental design, 15 active caffeine-naive men (age: 32 +- 7 years) completed a graded exercise test four times at seven-day intervals. The subjects ingested 3 mg/kg of caffeine or a placebo at 8 am in the morning and 5 pm in the afternoon (each subject completed tests under all four conditions in a random order). A graded cycling test was performed. MFO and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) were measured by indirect calorimetry, and the intensity of exercise that elicited MFO (Fatmax) calculated. Results MFO, Fatmax and VO2max were significantly higher in the afternoon than in the morning (all P < 0.05). Compared to the placebo, caffeine increased mean MFO by 10.7% (0.28 +- 0.10 vs. 0.31 +- 0.09 g/min respectively, P < 0.001) in the morning, and by a mean 29.0% (0.31 +- 0.09 vs. 0.40 +- 0.10 g/min, P < 0.001) in the afternoon. Caffeine also increased mean Fatmax by 11.1% (36.9 +- 14.4 [placebo] vs. 41.0 +- 13.1%, P = 0.005) in the morning, and by 13.1% (42.0 +- 11.6 vs. 47.5 +- 10.8%, P = 0.008) in the afternoon. Conclusion These findings confirm the previously reported diurnal variation in the whole-body fat oxidation rate during graded exercise in active caffeine-naive men, and indicate that the acute ingestion of 3 mg/kg of caffeine increases MFO, Fatmax and VO2max independent of the time of day.

33413331/Suppression of autophagy through JAK2/STAT3 contributes to the therapeutic action of rhynchophylline on asthma Background Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airway remodeling and inflammation. Rhynchophylline is a kind of indole alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla. Here we investigated the effect of rhynchophylline on autophagy in asthma. Methods A mice model of asthma was established by ovalbumin challenge. Histopathological changes were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, periodic acid-schiff staining and Masson staining. The levels of IgE in serum, interleukin-6 and interleukin-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in lung tissues were detected. The expression of autophagy-related genes and Janus kinase (JAK) 2/ signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 signal was detected by western blot and immunofluorescence. Airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) were isolated, and the effect rhynchophylline on autophagy in ASMCs was explored. Results Our data showed that rhynchophylline treatment alleviated inflammation, airway remodeling, and oxidative stress in asthma. In addition, autophagy, which was implicated in asthma, was suppressed by rhynchophylline with decreased level of autophagy-related proteins. Furthermore, rhynchophylline suppressed the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which was activated in asthma. In vitro study showed that rhynchophylline suppressed ASMC autophagy through suppressing the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signal. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that rhynchophylline can alleviate asthma through suppressing autophagy in asthma, and that JAK2/STAT3 signal was involved in this effect of rhynchophylline. This study indicates that rhynchophylline may become a promising drug for the treatment of asthma.
33413411/Effect of overexpression of SNF1 on the transcriptional and metabolic landscape of baker's yeast under freezing stress Background Freezing stress is the key factor that affecting the cell activity and fermentation performance of baker's yeast in frozen dough production. Generally, cells protect themselves from injury and maintain metabolism by regulating gene expression and modulating metabolic patterns in stresses. The Snf1 protein kinase is an important regulator of yeast in response to stresses. In this study, we aim to study the role of the catalytic subunit of Snf1 protein kinase in the cell tolerance and dough leavening ability of baker's yeast during freezing. Furthermore, the effects of SNF1 overexpression on the global gene expression and metabolite profile of baker's yeast before and after freezing were analysed using RNA-sequencing and untargeted UPLC - QTOF-MS/MS, respectively. Results The results suggest that overexpression of SNF1 was effective in enhancing the cell tolerance and fermentation capacity of baker's yeast in freezing, which may be related to the upregulated proteasome, altered metabolism of carbon sources and protectant molecules, and changed cell membrane components. SNF1 overexpression altered the level of leucin, proline, serine, isoleucine, arginine, homocitrulline, glycerol, palmitic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE) before freezing, conferring cells resistance in freezing. After freezing, relative high level of proline, lysine, and glycerol maintained by SNF1 overexpression with increased content of LysoPC and LysoPE. Conclusions This study will increase the knowledge of the cellular response of baker's yeast cells to freezing and provide new opportunities for the breeding of low-temperature resistant strains.
33417602/Quality of oxytocin and misoprostol in health facilities of Rwanda Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 calls for a reduction of the maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. The most important cause of maternal mortality is post-partum haemorrhage (PPH). Oxytocin injections and misoprostol tablets are medicines of first choice for the management of PPH in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Unfortunately, both substances are chemically unstable, and previous studies have revealed serious quality problems of these medicines in LMICs. The present study is the first report on their quality in Rwanda. From 40 randomly selected health facilities (hospitals, health centers, retail pharmacies and private clinics) in different parts of Rwanda, as well as from six wholesalers and government stores, oxytocin injections and misoprostol tablets were collected. Oxytocin storage temperatures in the health facilities were monitored for six months using temperature data loggers, and found to correctly follow the storage requirements stated by the manufacturers (2-8 C, or room temperature) with few minor deviations. Oxytocin injections (57 samples, representing seven batches of four brands) were tested for their oxytocin content and pH value according to the United States Pharmacopeia. Twenty-four samples from three European manufacturers passed all tests. However, all nine samples of one batch of a Chinese manufacturer showed an excessive content of oxytocin (range 117.2-121.5% of the declared amount). Another batch of the same manufacturer showed extreme variations of the concentration of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Misoprostol tablets (25 samples, representing ten batches of six brands) were tested for content and dissolution according to the International Pharmacopoeia. Fifteen samples passed, but all 10 samples of two brands from India failed with extreme deviations, containing only 42.5-48.7% of the stated amount of misoprostol. In conclusion, oxytocin quality in Rwanda was better than reported from other African countries. However, two extremely substandard brands of misoprostol tablets were found. The Rwandan authorities reacted quickly and efficiently, and recalled these substandard medicines from the market. For oxytocin and misoprostol, with their well-known problems of quality and stability, procurement should possibly be restricted to medicines which are WHO-prequalified or which have been manufactured in countries with stringent regulatory authorities.
33401623/Recent Advances in Metal Organic Frameworks Based Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Substrates: Synthesis and Applications Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are supramolecular nanomaterials, in which metal ions or clusters are connected by organic ligands to form crystalline lattices with highly ordered periodic porous network structure. MOFs have been widely applied in various fields, such as catalyst, sample preparation, and sensing. In recent years, MOFs based surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates have attracted much attention since MOFs can largely improve the performance of metallic SERS substrates toward target enrichment and signal enhancement. MOFs have been exploited in SERS analysis to tackle some challenges that bare metal substrates cannot achieve. Combination of MOFs and SERS improved the sensitivity of traditional SERS analysis and extended the application scope of SERS. With the increasing exploration of MOFs based SERS substrates, there is a great demand to review the advances in these researches. Herein, this review concentrated on summarizing the preparation and applications of MOFs based SERS substrates. Representative researches were discussed to better understand the property of MOFs based SERS substrates. The advantages of MOFs based SERS substrates were highlighted, as well as their limitations. In addition, the challenges, opportunities, and future trends in MOFs based SERS analysis were tentatively discussed.
33374249/Rational Design of Ag/ZnO Hybrid Nanoparticles on Sericin/Agarose Composite Film for Enhanced Antimicrobial Applications Silver-based hybrid nanomaterials are receiving increasing attention as potential alternatives for traditional antimicrobial agents. Here, we proposed a simple and eco-friendly strategy to efficiently assemble zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on sericin-agarose composite film to impart superior antimicrobial activity. Based on a layer-by-layer self-assembly strategy, AgNPs and ZnO were immobilized on sericin-agarose films using the adhesion property of polydopamine. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy were used to show the morphology of AgNPs and ZnO on the surface of the composite film and analyze the composition and structure of AgNPs and ZnO, respectively. Water contact angle, swelling ratio, and mechanical property were determined to characterize the hydrophilicity, water absorption ability, and mechanical properties of the composite films. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the composite film was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results showed that the composite film not only has desirable hydrophilicity, high water absorption ability, and favorable mechanical properties but also exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It has shown great potential as a novel antimicrobial biomaterial for wound dressing, artificial skin, and tissue engineering.
33379362/Regulation of Cholesterol Metabolism by Bioactive Components of Soy Proteins: Novel Translational Evidence Hypercholesterolemia represents one key pathophysiological factor predisposing to increasing risk of developing cardiovascular disease worldwide. Controlling plasma cholesterol levels and other metabolic risk factors is of paramount importance to prevent the overall burden of disease emerging from cardiovascular-disease-related morbidity and mortality. Dietary cholesterol undergoes micellization and absorption in the small intestine, transport via blood, and uptake in the liver. An important amount of cholesterol originates from hepatic synthesis, and is secreted by the liver into bile together with bile acids (BA) and phospholipids, with all forming micelles and vesicles. In clinical medicine, dietary recommendations play a key role together with pharmacological interventions to counteract the adverse effects of chronic hypercholesterolemia. Bioactive compounds may also be part of initial dietary plans. Specifically, soybean contains proteins and peptides with biological activity on plasma cholesterol levels and this property makes soy proteins a functional food. Here, we discuss how soy proteins modulate lipid metabolism and reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations in humans, with potential outcomes in improving metabolic- and dyslipidemia-related conditions.
33379198/IFNgamma Is a Key Link between Obesity and Th1-Mediated AutoImmune Diseases Obesity, a characteristic of metabolic syndrome, is also associated with chronic inflammation and the development of autoimmune diseases. However, the relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases remains to be investigated in depth. Here, we compared hepatic gene expression profiles among high-fat diet (HFD) mice using the primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) mouse model based on the chronic expression of interferon gamma (IFNgamma) (ARE-Del-/- mice). The top differentially expressed genes affected by upstream transcriptional regulators IFNgamma, LPS, and TNFalpha displayed an overlap in HFD and ARE-Del-/- mice, indicating that obesity-induced liver inflammation may be dependent on signaling via IFNgamma. The top pathways altered in HFD mice were mostly involved in the innate immune responses, which overlapped with ARE-Del-/- mice. In contrast, T cell-mediated signaling pathways were exclusively altered in ARE-Del-/- mice. We further evaluated the therapeutic effect of luteolin, known as anti-inflammatory flavonoid, in HFD and ARE-Del-/- mice. Luteolin strongly suppressed the MHC I and II antigen presentation pathways, which were highly activated in both HFD and ARE-Del-/- mice. Conversely, luteolin increased metabolic processes of fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation in the liver, which were suppressed in ARE-Del-/- mice. Luteolin also strongly induced PPAR signaling, which was downregulated in HFD and ARE-Del-/- mice. Using human GWAS data, we characterized the genetic interaction between significant obesity-related genes and IFNgamma signaling and demonstrated that IFNgamma is crucial for obesity-mediated inflammatory responses. Collectively, this study improves our mechanistic understanding of the relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, it provides new methodological insights into how immune network-based analyses effectively integrate RNA-seq and microarray data.
33396847/Generation of Mixed Anhydrides via Oxidative Fragmentation of Tertiary Cyclopropanols with Phenyliodine(III) Dicarboxylates Oxidative fragmentation of tertiary cyclopropanols with phenyliodine(III) dicarboxylates in aprotic solvents (dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene) produces mixed anhydrides. The fragmentation reaction is especially facile with phenyliodine(III) reagents bearing electron-withdrawing carboxylate ligands (trifluoroacetyl, 2,4,6-trichlorobenzoyl, 3-nitrobenzoyl), and affords 95-98% yields of the corresponding mixed anhydride products. The latter can be straightforwardly applied for the acylation of various nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur-centered nucleophiles (primary and secondary amines, hydroxylamines, primary alcohols, phenols, thiols). Intramolecular acylation yielding macrocyclic lactones can also be performed. The developed transformation has bolstered the synthetic utility of cyclopropanols as pluripotent intermediates in diversity-oriented synthesis of bioactive natural products and their synthetic congeners. For example, it was successfully applied for the last-stage modification of a cyclic peptide to produce a precursor of a known histone deacetylase inhibitor.
33396845/Curative Effect of Catechin Isolated from Elaeagnus Umbellata Thunb. Berries for Diabetes and Related Complications in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats Model In this study, catechin (CTN) isolated from Elaeagnus umbellata was evaluated for in vitro antioxidant potential and inhibition of carbohydrate digestive enzymes (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase). The compound was also tested for its in vivo antidiabetic potential using Sprague-Dawley rats as experimental animals. The effects of various doses of catechin in STZ (Streptozotocin) induced diabetic rats on fasting blood glucose level, body weight, lipid parameters, hepatic enzymes, and renal functions were evaluated using the reported protocols. The CTN exhibited the highest percent antioxidant for free radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS free radicals, and inhibited the activity of carbohydrate digestive enzymes (with percent inhibition values: 79 +- 1.5% alpha-amylase and 80 +- 1.1% alpha-glucosidase). Administration CTN and standard glibenclamide significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose level and increased the body weight in STZ-induced diabetic rats. CTN significantly decreased the different lipid parameters, hepatic, and renal function enzyme levels along with Hb1c level in diabetic rats, while significantly increasing the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level with values comparable to the standard glibenclamide. Further, the altered levels of glutathione and lipid peroxides of liver and kidney tissues were restored (by CTN) to levels similar to the control group. CTN significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activities, total content of reduced glutathione, and reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in rat liver and kidney tissues homogenates, and also corrected the histopathological abnormalities, suggesting its antioxidant potential.
33396585/HPLC Determination of Imidazoles with Variant Anti-Infective Activity in Their Dosage Forms and Human Plasma A suitable HPLC method has been selected and validated for rapid simultaneous separation and determination of four imidazole anti-infective drugs, secnidazole, omeprazole, albendazole, and fenbendazole, in their final dosage forms, in addition to human plasma within 5 min. The method suitability was derived from the superiority of using the environmentally benign solvent, methanol over acetonitrile as a mobile phase component in respect of safety issues and migration times. Separation of the four anti-infective drugs was performed on a Thermo Scientific  BDS Hypersil C8 column (5 microm, 2.50 x 4.60 mm) using a mobile phase consist of MeOH: 0.025 M KH2PO4 (70:30, v/v) adjusted to pH 3.20 with ortho-phosphoric acid at room temperature. The flow rate was 1.00 mL/min and maximum absorption was measured with UV detector set at 300 nm. Limits of detection were reported to be 0.41, 0.13, 0.18, and 0.15 microg/mL for secnidazole, omeprazole, albendazole, and fenbendazole, respectively, showing a high degree of the method sensitivity. The method of analysis was validated according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)guidelines for the determination of the drugs, either in their dosage forms with highly precise recoveries, or clinically in human plasma, especially regarding pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies.
33379376/Evaluation of the Physicochemical Properties, Pharmacokinetics, and In Vitro Anticancer Effects of Docetaxel and Osthol Encapsulated in Methoxy Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-Poly(caprolactone) Polymeric Micelles Docetaxel (DTX), a taxane-based anticancer drug, and osthol (OTH), a coumarin-derivative compound, have shown anticancer effects against different types of cancers through various mechanisms. However, these drugs have low solubility in water and low oral bioavailability, and thus their clinical application is difficult. To overcome these problems, we encapsulated DTX and OTH in methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(caprolactone) (mPEG-b-PCL) and conducted studies in vitro and in vivo. We selected a 1:4 ratio as the optimal ratio of DTX and OTH, through combination index analysis in A549 cancer cells, and prepared micelles to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, particle size, and zeta potential. The in vitro drug-release profile showed that DTX/OTH-loaded mPEG-b-PCL micelles could slowly release DTX and OTH. In the clonogenic assay, DTX/OTH-loaded mPEG-b-PCL micelles showed 3.7 times higher inhibitory effect than the DTX/OTH solution. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that micelles in combination with DTX and OTH exhibited increased area under curve and decreased clearance values, as compared with single micelles.
33401727/Immobilization of Eversa  Transform via CLEA Technology Converts It in a Suitable Biocatalyst for Biolubricant Production Using Waste Cooking Oil The performance of the previously optimized magnetic cross-linked enzyme aggregate of Eversa (Eversa-mCLEA) in the enzymatic synthesis of biolubricants by transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) with different alcohols has been evaluated. Eversa-mCLEA showed good activities using these alcohols, reaching a transesterification activity with isoamyl alcohol around 10-fold higher than with methanol. Yields of isoamyl fatty acid ester synthesis were similar using WCO or refined oil, confirming that this biocatalyst could be utilized to transform this residue into a valuable product. The effects of WCO/isoamyl alcohol molar ratio and enzyme load on the synthesis of biolubricant were also investigated. A maximum yield of around 90 wt.% was reached after 72 h of reaction using an enzyme load of 12 esterification units/g oil and a WCO/alcohol molar ratio of 1:6 in a solvent-free system. At the same conditions, the liquid Eversa yielded a maximum ester yield of only 34%. This study demonstrated the great changes in the enzyme properties that can be derived from a proper immobilization system. Moreover, it also shows the potential of WCO as a feedstock for the production of isoamyl fatty acid esters, which are potential candidates as biolubricants.
33401708/Iron Chelation in Local Infection Iron is an essential element in multiple biochemical pathways in humans and pathogens. As part of the innate immune response in local infection, iron availability is restricted locally in order to reduce overproduction of reactive oxygen species by the host and to attenuate bacterial growth. This physiological regulation represents the rationale for the therapeutic use of iron chelators to support induced iron deprivation and to treat infections. In this review paper we discuss the importance of iron regulation through examples of local infection and the potential of iron chelation in treating infection.
33379332/Kaempferol Inhibits Zearalenone-Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt-Mediated Nrf2 Signaling Pathway: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies In this study, kaempferol (KFL) shows hepatoprotective activity against zearalenone (ZEA)-induced oxidative stress and its underlying mechanisms in in vitro and in vivo models were investigated. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of various hepatic ailments and is normally regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ZEA is a mycotoxin known to exert toxicity via inflammation and ROS accumulation. This study aims to explore the protective role of KFL against ZEA-triggered hepatic injury via the PI3K/Akt-regulated Nrf2 pathway. KFL augmented the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, which may stimulate antioxidative and antiapoptotic signaling in hepatic cells. KFL upregulated Nrf2 phosphorylation and the expression of antioxidant genes HO-1 and NQO-1 in a dose-dependent manner under ZEA-induced oxidative stress. Nrf2 knockdown via small-interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the KFL-mediated defence against ZEA-induced hepatotoxicity. In vivo studies showed that KFL decreased inflammation and lipid peroxidation and increased H2O2 scavenging and biochemical marker enzyme expression. KFL was able to normalize the expression of liver antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GSH and showed a protective effect against ZEA-induced pathophysiology in the livers of mice. These outcomes demonstrate that KFL possesses notable hepatoprotective roles against ZEA-induced damage in vivo and in vitro. These protective properties of KFL may occur through the stimulation of Nrf2/HO-1 cascades and PI3K/Akt signaling.
33375614/Characterization of Anthocyanins and Anthocyanin-Derivatives in Red Wines during Ageing in Custom Oxygenation Oak Wood Barrels The ageing of wines in oak barrels is a key stage in the production of high-quality red wines, with the type of oak chosen and the amount of oxygen received by the wine being the determining factors of the process. This work analyses the effect of ageing the same red wine in barrels with different oxygenation rates for one year (OTR), specifically the effect on the evolution of anthocyanins, their derivatives and the appearance of new pigments according to the oxygen dosage in barrels. Results show that wines aged in High-Wood-OTR barrels have a large quantity of monomeric anthocyanins and wine aged in Low-Wood-OTR barrels presents a major intensity of colour. Moreover, using LC-MS analysis, it was possible to detect and identify different families of anthocyanin derivatives, including the tentative identification of two new aldehyde-flavanol-methylpyranoanthocyanin pigments.
33375280/Induction of Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction by Juglone Affects the Development of Bovine Oocytes Juglone, a major naphthalenedione component of walnut trees, has long been used in traditional medicine as an antimicrobial and antitumor agent. Nonetheless, its impact on oocyte and preimplantation embryo development has not been entirely clarified. Using the bovine model, we sought to elucidate the impact of juglone treatment during the in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes on their maturation and development of embryos. Results showed a severe reduction in oocyte nuclear maturation and cumulus expansion and a significant increase in mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) treated with juglone (12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 microM). In addition, RT-qPCR showed downregulation of the expansion-related (HAS2, TNFAIP6, PTX3, and PTGS2) and mitochondrial (ATPase6 and ATP5F1E) genes in juglone-treated COCs. Moreover, the development rates of day 4 total cleavage and 8-16 cell stage embryos, as well as day 8 blastocysts, were significantly reduced following exposure to juglone. Using immunofluorescence, the apoptotic marker caspase-9 was overexpressed in oocytes exposed to juglone (25.0 microM) compared to the untreated control. In conclusion, our study reports that exposing bovine oocytes to 12.5-50.0 microM of juglone can reduce their development through the direct induction of ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
33401649/Anticancer Activity of Lesbicoumestan in Jurkat Cells via Inhibition of Oxidative Stress-Mediated Apoptosis and MALT1 Protease This study explores the potential anticancer effects of lesbicoumestan from Lespedeza bicolor against human leukemia cancer cells. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were used to investigate antiproliferative effects. The degradation of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) was evaluated using immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Apoptosis was investigated using three-dimensional (3D) Jurkat cell resistance models. Lesbicoumestan induced potent mitochondrial depolarization on the Jurkat cells via upregulated expression levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the underlying apoptotic mechanisms of lesbicoumestan through the MALT1/NF-kappaB pathway were comprehensively elucidated. The analysis showed that lesbicoumestan significantly induced MALT1 degradation, which led to the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, molecular docking results illustrate how lesbicoumestan could effectively bind with MALT1 protease at the latter's active pocket. Similar to traditional 2D cultures, apoptosis was markedly induced upon lesbicoumestan treatment in 3D Jurkat cell resistance models. Our data support the hypothesis that lesbicoumestan is a novel inhibitor of MALT1, as it exhibited potent antiapoptotic effects in Jurkat cells.
33374161/Novel Polyhedral Silsesquioxanes [POSS(OH)32] as Anthracycline Nanocarriers:Potential Anticancer Prodrugs Anthracyclines belong to the anticancer drugs that are widely used in chemotherapy. However, due to their systemic toxicity they also exert dangerous side effects associated mainly with cardiovascular risks. The pathway that is currently often developed is their chemical and physical modification via formation of conjugated or complexed prodrug systems with a variety of nanocarriers that can selectively release the active species in cancer cells. In this study, six new nanoconjugates were synthesized with the use of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes [POSS(OH)32] as nanocarriers of the anticancer drugs anthracyclines:doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DAU). These prodrug conjugates are also equipped with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moieties of different structure and molecular weight. Water-soluble POSS, succinic anhydride modified (SAMDOX and SAMDAU) with carboxylic function, and PEGs (PEG1, PEG2 and PEGB3) were used for the synthesis. New nanoconjugates were formed via ester bonds and their structure was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C HSQC, DOSY and 1H-1H COSY), FTIR and DLS. Drug release rate was evaluated using UV-Vis spectroscopy at pH of 5.5. Release profiles of anthracyclines from conjugates 4-9 point to a range of 10 to 75% (after 42 h). Additionally, model NMR tests as well as diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) confirmed formation of the relevant prodrugs. The POSS-anthracycline conjugates exhibited prolonged active drug release time that can lead to the possibility of lowering administered doses and thus giving them high potential in chemotherapy. Drug release from conjugate 7 after 42 h was approx. 10%, 33% for conjugate 4, 47% for conjugate 5, 6, 8 and 75% for conjugate 9.
33375638/Removal Mechanism Investigation of Ultraviolet Induced Nanoparticle Colloid Jet Machining Ultraviolet induced nanoparticle colloid jet machining is a new ultra-precision machining technology utilizing the reaction between nanoparticles and the surface of the workpiece to achieve sub-nanometer ultra-smooth surface manufacturing without damage. First-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to study the atomic material removal mechanism of nanoparticle colloid jet machining and a series of impacting and polishing experiments were conducted to verify the mechanism. New chemical bonds of Ti-O-Si were generated through the chemical adsorption between the surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups of the TiO2 cluster and the Si surface with the adsorption energy of at least -4.360 eV. The two Si-Si back bonds were broken preferentially and the Si atom was removed in the separation process of TiO2 cluster from the Si surface realizing the atomic material removal. A layer of adsorbed TiO2 nanoparticles was detected on the Si surface after 3 min of fixed-point injection of an ultraviolet induced nanoparticle colloid jet. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that Ti-O-Si bonds were formed between TiO2 nanoparticles and Si surface corresponding to the calculation result. An ultra-smooth Si workpiece with a roughness of Rq 0.791 nm was obtained by ultraviolet induced nanoparticle colloid jet machining.
33379339/Compensation Mechanism of the Photosynthetic Apparatus in Arabidopsis thaliana ch1 Mutants The origin of chlorophyll b deficiency is a mutation (ch1) in chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), the enzyme responsible for Chl b synthesis. Regulation of Chl b synthesis is essential for understanding the mechanism of plant acclimation to various conditions. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to find the strategy in plants for compensation of low chlorophyll content by characterizing and comparing the performance and spectral properties of the photosynthetic apparatus related to the lipid and protein composition in four selected Arabidopsis ch1 mutants and two Arabidopsis ecotypes. Mutation in different loci of the CAO gene, viz., NW41, ch1.1, ch1.2 and ch1.3, manifested itself in a distinct chlorina phenotype, pigment and photosynthetic protein composition. Changes in the CAO mRNA levels and chlorophyllide a (Chlide a) content in ecotypes and ch1 mutants indicated their significant role in the adjustment mechanism of the photosynthetic apparatus to low-light conditions. Exposure of mutants with a lower chlorophyll b content to short-term (1LL) and long-term low-light stress (10LL) enabled showing a shift in the structure of the PSI and PSII complexes via spectral analysis and the thylakoid composition studies. We demonstrated that both ecotypes, Col-1 and Ler-0, reacted to high-light (HL) conditions in a way remarkably resembling the response of ch1 mutants to normal (NL) conditions. We also presented possible ways of regulating the conversion of chlorophyll a to b depending on the type of light stress conditions.
33401754/Structure-Acid Lability Relationship of N-alkylated alpha,alpha-dialkylglycine Obtained via a Ugi Multicomponent Reaction Using the classical Ugi four-component reaction to fuse an amine, ketone, carboxylic acid, and isocyanide, here we prepared a short library of N-alkylated alpha,alpha-dialkylglycine derivatives. Due to the polyfunctionality of the dipeptidic scaffold, this highly steric hindered system shows an interesting acidolytic cleavage of the C-terminal amide. In this regard, we studied the structure-acid lability relationship of the C-terminal amide bond (cyclohexylamide) of N-alkylated alpha,alpha-dialkylglycine amides 1a-n in acidic media and, afterward, it was established that the most important structural features related to its cleavage. Then, it was demonstrated that electron-donating effects in the aromatic amines, flexible acyl chains (Gly) at the N-terminal and the introduction of cyclic compounds into dipeptide scaffolds, increased the rate of acidolysis. All these effects are related to the ease with which the oxazolonium ion intermediate forms and they promote the proximity of the central carbonyl group to the C-terminal amide, resulting in C-terminal amide cleavage. Consequently, these findings could be applied for the design of new protecting groups, handles for solid-phase synthesis, and linkers for conjugation, due to its easily modulable and the fact that it allows to fine tune its acid-lability.
33374326/Dose-Dependent Effects of Resveratrol on Cisplatin-Induced Hearing Loss Previous preclinical studies have demonstrated the otoprotective effects of resveratrol (RV) at low doses. This study aimed to investigate the dose-dependent effects of RV in rats with cisplatin (CXP)-induced hearing loss. Sprague-Dawley rats (8-weeks old) were divided into six treatment groups (n = 12/group) and treated as follows: control, 0.5 mg/kg RV, 50 mg/kg RV, CXP, 0.5 mg/kg RV + CXP), and 50 mg/kg RV + CXP groups. CXP (3 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected for 5 days. RV (0.5 or 50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected for 10 days from the first day of CXP administration. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured before and within 3 days at the end of the drug administration. Cochlear tissues were harvested, and the outer hair cells were examined using cochlear whole mounts. The mRNA expression of NFkappaB, IL6, IL1beta, and CYP1A1, and protein levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and cytosolic and nuclear receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) were evaluated. The ABR threshold increased in the 50 mg/kg RV and CXP groups at 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz. The 0.5 mg/kg RV + CXP group demonstrated decreased hearing thresholds at 4 and 32 kHz compared to the CXP group. Cochlear whole-mount analysis revealed loss of outer hair cells in the 50 mg/kg RV and CXP groups and partial prevention of these cells in the 0.5 mg/kg RV + CXP group. The mRNA expressions of NFkappaB, IL6, and IL1beta were increased in the 50 mg/kg RV and CXP groups compared to the control group. In contrast, these levels were decreased in the 0.5 mg/kg RV + CXP group compared to the CXP group. The mRNA expression of CYP1A1 was increased in the CXP group, while it was decreased in the 0.5 mg/kg RV + CXP group compared to the control group. The protein levels of AhR and cytosolic RAGE decreased in the 0.5 mg/kg RV group. Low-dose RV had partial otoprotective effects on CXP ototoxicity. The otoprotective effects of RV may be mediated through anti-oxidative (CYP1A1 and RAGE) and anti-inflammatory (NFkappaB, IL6, and IL1beta) responses. High-dose RV exerted an inflammatory response and did not ameliorate CXP-induced ototoxicity.
33375356/In Vitro Photodynamic Effects of the Inclusion Nanocomplexes of Glucan and Chlorin e6 on Atherogenic Foam Cells Macrophage-derived foam cells play critical roles in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Activated macrophages and foam cells are important biomarkers for targeted imaging and inflammatory disease therapy. Macrophages also express the dectin-1 receptor, which specifically recognizes beta-glucan (Glu). Here, we prepared photoactivatable nanoagents (termed Glu/Ce6 nanocomplexes) by encapsulating hydrophobic chlorin e6 (Ce6) within the triple-helix structure of Glu in aqueous condition. Glu/Ce6 nanocomplexes generate singlet oxygen upon laser irradiation. The Glu/Ce6 nanocomplexes were internalized into foam cells and delivered Ce6 molecules into the cytoplasm of foam cells. Upon laser irradiation, they induced significant membrane damage and apoptosis of foam cells. These results suggest that Glu/Ce6 nanocomplexes can be a photoactivatable material for treating atherogenic foam cells. 
33374365/Betulinic Acid Protects DOX-Triggered Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy Response through the GATA-4/Calcineurin/NFAT Pathway Cardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor for heart failure and leads to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Doxorubicin (DOX) is regarded as one of the most potent anthracycline antibiotic agents; however, its clinical usage has some limitations because it has serious cardiotoxic side effects such as dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Betulinic acid (BA) is a pentacyclic-cyclic lupane-type triterpene that has been reported to have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-vascular neogenesis, and anti-fibrotic effects. However, there is no study about its direct effect on DOX induced cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. The present study aims to investigate the effect of BA on DOX-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis in vitro in H9c2 cells. The H9c2 cells were stimulated with DOX (1 microM) in the presence or absence of BA (0.1-1 muM) and incubated for 24 h. The results of the present study indicated that DOX induces the increase cell surface area and the upregulation of hypertrophy markers including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), and Myosin Light Chain-2 (MLC2) in H9c2 cells. However, the pathological hypertrophic responses were downregulated after BA treatment. Moreover, phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 in DOX treated H9c2 cells was blocked by BA. As a result of measuring the change in ROS generation using DCF-DA, BA significantly inhibited DOX-induced the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) when BA was treated at a concentration of over 0.1 microM. DOX-induced activation of GATA-4 and calcineurin/NFAT-3 signaling pathway were remarkably improved by pre-treating of BA to H9c2 cells. In addition, BA treatment significantly reduced DOX-induced cell apoptosis and protein expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3/-9, while the expression of Bcl-2 was increased by BA. Therefore, BA can be a potential treatment for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis that lead to sudden heart failure.
33379173/Coiled-Coil N21 of Hpa1 in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Promotes Plant Growth, Disease Resistance and Drought Tolerance in Non-Hosts via Eliciting HR and Regulation of Multiple Defense Response Genes Acting as a typical harpin protein, Hpa1 of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is one of the pathogenic factors in hosts and can elicit hypersensitive responses (HR) in non-hosts. To further explain the underlying mechanisms of its induced resistance, we studied the function of the most stable and shortest three heptads in the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Hpa1, named N21Hpa1. Proteins isolated from N21-transgenic tobacco elicited HR in Xanthi tobacco, which was consistent with the results using N21 and full-length Hpa1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. N21-expressing tobacco plants showed enhanced resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Pectobacterium carotovora subsp. carotovora (Pcc). Spraying of a synthesized N21 peptide solution delayed the disease symptoms caused by Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia fructicola and promoted the growth and drought tolerance of plants. Further analysis indicated that N21 upregulated the expression of multiple plant defense-related genes, such as genes mediated by salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling, and genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosynthesis. Further, the bioavailability of N21 peptide was better than that of full-length Hpa1Xoo. Our studies support the broad application prospects of N21 peptide as a promising succedaneum to biopesticide Messenger or Illite or other biological pharmaceutical products, and provide a basis for further development of biopesticides using proteins with similar structures.
33374444/Antimalarials and Phytotoxins from Botryosphaeria dothidea Identified from a Seed of Diseased Torreya taxifolia The metabolic pathways in the apicoplast organelle of Plasmodium parasites are similar to those in plastids in plant cells and are suitable targets for malaria drug discovery. Some phytotoxins released by plant pathogenic fungi have been known to target metabolic pathways of the plastid; thus, they may also serve as potential antimalarial drug leads. An EtOAc extract of the broth of the endophyte Botryosphaeria dothidea isolated from a seed collected from a Torreya taxifolia plant with disease symptoms, showed in vitro antimalarial and phytotoxic activities. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the extract afforded a mixture of two known isomeric phytotoxins, FRT-A and flavipucine (or their enantiomers, sapinopyridione and (-)-flavipucine), and two new unstable gamma-lactam alkaloids dothilactaenes A and B. The isomeric mixture of phytotoxins displayed strong phytotoxicity against both a dicot and a monocot and moderate cytotoxicity against a panel of cell lines. Dothilactaene A showed no activity. Dothilactaene B was isolated from the active fraction, which showed moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activity with high selectivity index. In spite of this activity, its instability and various other biological activities shown by related compounds would preclude it from being a viable antimalarial lead.
33379248/Curcumin Metabolite Tetrahydrocurcumin in the Treatment of Eye Diseases Curcumin is one of the most valuable natural products due to its pharmacological activities. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin has long been a problem for its medicinal use. Large studies have been conducted to improve the use of curcumin; among these studies, curcumin metabolites have become a relatively new research focus over the past few years. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that curcumin or curcuminoid metabolites have similar or better biological activity than the precursor of curcumin. Recent studies focus on the protective role of plasma tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a main metabolite of curcumin, against tumors and chronic inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, studies of THC in eye diseases have not yet been conducted. Since ophthalmic conditions play a crucial role in worldwide public health, the prevention and treatment of ophthalmic diseases are of great concern. Therefore, the present study investigated the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and neuroprotective effects of THC on four major ocular diseases: age-related cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). While this study aimed to show curcumin as a promising potential solution for eye conditions and discusses the involved mechanistic pathways, further work is required for the clinical application of curcumin.
33375250/Postnatal Smoke Exposure Further Increases the Hepatic Nicotine Metabolism in Prenatally Smoke Exposed Male Offspring and Is Linked with Aberrant Cyp2a5 Methylation Prenatal smoke exposure (PreSE) is a risk factor for nicotine dependence, which is further enhanced by postnatal smoke exposure (PostSE). One susceptibility gene to nicotine dependence is Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of nicotine to cotinine in the liver. Higher CYP2A6 activity is associated with nicotine dependence and could be regulated through DNA methylation. In this study we investigated whether PostSE further impaired PreSE-induced effects on nicotine metabolism, along with Cyp2a5, orthologue of CYP2A6, mRNA expression and DNA methylation. Using a mouse model where prenatally smoke-exposed adult offspring were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 months, enzyme activity, mRNA levels, and promoter methylation of hepatic Cyp2a5 were evaluated. We found that in male offspring, PostSE increased PreSE-induced cotinine levels and Cyp2a5 mRNA expression. In addition, both PostSE and PreSE changed Cyp2a5 DNA methylation in male groups. PreSE however decreased cotinine levels whereas it had no effect on Cyp2a5 mRNA expression or methylation. These adverse outcomes of PreSE and PostSE were most prominent in males. When considered in the context of the human health aspects, the combined effect of prenatal and adolescent smoke exposure could lead to an accelerated risk for nicotine dependence later in life.
33374180/In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Major Cannabis-Derived Compounds as Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitors Accumulated evidence suggests that enhancing the endocannabinoid (eCB) tone, in particular of anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA), has therapeutic potential in many human diseases. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a membrane-bound enzyme principally responsible for the degradation of AEA, and thus it represents a relevant target to increase signaling thereof. In recent years, different synthetic and natural compounds have been developed and tested on rat FAAH, but little is known of their effect on the human enzyme. Here, we sought to investigate six major cannabis-derived compounds to compare their action on rat and human FAAHs. To this aim, we combined an in silico analysis of their binding mode and affinity, with in vitro assays of their effect on enzyme activity. This integrated approach allowed to disclose differences in efficacy towards rat and human FAAHs, and to highlight the role of key residues involved in the inhibition of both enzymes. This study suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of compounds targeted towards FAAH should be always tested in vitro on both rat and human enzymes.
33379346/Inhibitory Effect of (2R)-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol 2-O-beta-d-apiofuranosyl-(1 6)-beta-d-glucopyranoside on RANKL-Induced Osteoclast Differentiation and ROS Generation in Macrophages In bone homeostasis, bone loss due to excessive osteoclasts and inflammation or osteolysis in the bone formation process cause bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Suppressing the accompanying oxidative stress such as ROS in this process is an important treatment strategy for bone disease. Therefore, in this study, the effect of (2R)-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol 2-O-beta-d-apiofuranosyl-(1 6)-beta-d-glucopyranoside (BAG), an arylbutanoid glycoside isolated from Betula platyphylla var. japonica was investigated in RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells and LPS-stimulated MC3E3-T1 cells. BAG inhibited the activity of TRAP, an important marker of osteoclast differentiation and F-actin ring formation, which has osteospecific structure. In addition, the protein and gene levels were suppressed of integrin beta3 and CCL4, which play an important role in the osteoclast-induced bone resorption and migration of osteoclasts, and inhibited the production of ROS and restored the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT lost by RANKL. The inhibitory effect of BAG on osteoclast differentiation and ROS production appears to be due to the inhibition of MAPKs phosphorylation and NF-kappabeta translocation, which play a major role in osteoclast differentiation. In addition, BAG inhibited ROS generated by LPS and effectively restores the mineralization of lost osteoblasts, thereby showing the effect of bone formation in the inflammatory situation accompanying bone loss by excessive osteoclasts, suggesting its potential as a new natural product-derived bone disease treatment.
33383905/Comparative Chemical Profiles of the Essential Oils from Different Varieties of Psidium guajava L. Guava (Psidium guajava) leaves are commonly used in the treatment of diseases. They are considered a waste product resulting from guava cultivation. The leaves are very rich in essential oils (EOs) and volatiles. This work represents the detailed comparative chemical profiles of EOs derived from the leaves of six guava varieties cultivated in Egypt, including Red Malaysian (RM), El-Qanater (EQ), White Indian (WI), Early (E), El-Sabahya El-Gedida (ESEG), and Red Indian (RI), cultivated on the same farm in Egypt. The EOs from the leaves of guava varieties were extracted by hydro-distillation and analyzed with GC-MS. The EOs were categorized in a holistic manner using chemometric tools. The hydro-distillation of the samples yielded 0.11-0.48% of the EO (v/w). The GC-MS analysis of the extracted EOs showed the presence of 38 identified compounds from the six varieties. The sesquiterpene compounds were recorded as main compounds of E, EQ, ESEG, RI, and WI varieties, while the RM variety attained the highest content of monoterpenes (56.87%). The sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene (11.21-43.20%), and globulol (76.17-26.42%) were detected as the major compounds of all studied guava varieties, while trans-nerolidol (0.53-10.14) was reported as a plentiful compound in all of the varieties except for the RM variety. A high concentration of D-limonene was detected in the EOs of the RM (33.96%), WI (27.04%), and ESEG (9.10%) varieties. These major compounds were consistent with those reported for other genotypes from different countries. Overall, the EOs' composition and the chemometric analysis revealed substantial variations among the studied varieties that might be ascribed to genetic variability, considering the stability of the cultivation and climate conditions. Therefore, this chemical polymorphism of the studied varieties supports that these varieties could be considered as genotypes of P. guajava. It is worth mentioning here that the EOs, derived from leaves considered to be agricultural waste, of the studied varieties showed that they are rich in biologically active compounds, particularly beta-caryophyllene, trans-nerolidol, globulol, and D-limonene. These could be considered as added value for pharmacological and industrial applications. Further study is recommended to confirm the chemical variations of the studied varieties at a molecular level, as well as their possible medicinal and industrial uses.
33374383/Volatile Compounds of Lemon and Grapefruit IntegroPectin An HS-SPME GC-MS analysis of the volatile compounds adsorbed at the outer surface of lemon and grapefruit pectins obtained via the hydrodynamic cavitation of industrial waste streams of lemon and grapefruit peels in water suggests important new findings en route to understanding the powerful and broad biological activity of these new pectic materials. In agreement with the ultralow degree of esterification of these pectins, the high amount of highly bioactive alpha-terpineol and terpinen-4-ol points to limonene (and linalool) decomposition catalyzed by residual citric acid in the citrus waste peel residue of the juice industrial production.
33374351/A Label-Free Cellular Proteomics Approach to Decipher the Antifungal Action of DiMIQ, a Potent Indolo[2,3-b]Quinoline Agent, against Candida albicans Biofilms Candida albicans forms extremely drug-resistant biofilms, which present a serious threat to public health globally. Biofilm-based infections are difficult to treat due to the lack of efficient antifungal therapeutics, resulting in an urgent demand for the development of novel antibiofilm strategies. In this study, the antibiofilm activity of DiMIQ (5,11-dimethyl-5H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoline) was evaluated against C. albicans biofilms. DiMIQ is a synthetic derivative of indoquinoline alkaloid neocryptolepine isolated from a medicinal African plant, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta. Antifungal activity of DiMIQ was determined using the XTT assay, followed by cell wall and extracellular matrix profiling and cellular proteomes. Here, we demonstrated that DiMIQ inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation and altered fungal cell walls and the extracellular matrix. Cellular proteomics revealed inhibitory action against numerous translation-involved ribosomal proteins, enzymes involved in general energy producing processes and select amino acid metabolic pathways including alanine, aspartate, glutamate, valine, leucine and isoleucine. DiMIQ also stimulated pathways of cellular oxidation, metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, arginine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and nucleic acids (aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, RNA transport, nucleotide metabolism). Our findings suggest that DiMIQ inhibits C. albicans biofilms by arresting translation and multidirectional pathway reshaping of cellular metabolism. Overall, this agent may provide a potent alternative to treating biofilm-associated Candida infections.
33383931/UV Protective, Antioxidant, Antibacterial and Compostable Polylactic Acid Composites Containing Pristine and Chemically Modified Lignin Nanoparticles Polylactic acid (PLA) films containing 1 wt % and 3 wt % of lignin nanoparticles (pristine (LNP), chemically modified with citric acid (caLNP) and acetylated (aLNP)) were prepared by extrusion and characterized in terms of their overall performance as food packaging materials. Morphological, mechanical, thermal, UV-Vis barrier, antioxidant and antibacterial properties were assayed; appropriate migration values in food simulants and disintegration in simulated composting conditions were also verified. The results obtained indicated that all lignin nanoparticles succeeded in conferring UV-blocking, antioxidant and antibacterial properties to the PLA films, especially at the higher filler loadings assayed. Chemical modification of the fillers partially reduced the UV protection and the antioxidant properties of the resulting composites, but it induced better nanoparticles dispersion, reduced aggregates size, enhanced ductility and improved aesthetic quality of the films through reduction of the characteristic dark color of lignin. Migration tests and disintegration assays of the nanocomposites in simulated composting conditions indicated that, irrespectively of their formulation, the multifunctional nanocomposite films prepared behaved similarly to neat PLA.
33379175/Phenolic Compounds Cannabidiol, Curcumin and Quercetin Cause Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Suppress Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells Anticancer activity of different phenols is documented, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Recently, we have shown that cannabidiol kills the cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by a direct interaction with mitochondria, with their consequent dysfunction. In the present study, cytotoxic effects of several phenolic compounds against human the T-ALL cell line Jurkat were tested by means of resazurin-based metabolic assay. To unravel underlying mechanisms, mitochondrial membrane potential ( Psim) and [Ca2+]m measurements were undertaken, and reactive oxygen species generation and cell death were evaluated by flow cytometry. Three out of eight tested phenolics, cannabidiol, curcumin and quercetin, which displayed a significant cytotoxic effect, also dissipated the  Psim and induced a significant [Ca2+]m increase, whereas inefficient phenols did not. Dissipation of the  Psim by cannabidiol was prevented by cyclosporine A and reverted by Ru360, inhibitors of the permeation transition pore and mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, respectively. Ru360 prevented the phenol-induced [Ca2+]m rise, but neither cyclosporine A nor Ru360 affected the curcumin- and quercetin-induced  Psim depolarization. Ru360 impeded the curcumin- and cannabidiol-induced cell death. Thus, all three phenols exert their antileukemic activity via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, whereas curcumin and quercetin suppress the metabolism of leukemic cells by direct mitochondrial uncoupling.
33383750/DFT Study of Molecular and Electronic Structure of Y, La and Lu Complexes with Porphyrazine and Tetrakis(1,2,5-thiadiazole)porphyrazine Abstract Electronic and geometric structures of Y, La and Lu complexes with porphyrazine (Pz) and tetrakis(1,2,5-thiadiazole)porphyrazine (TTDPz) were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and compared. The nature of the bonds between metal atoms and nitrogen atoms has been described using the analysis of the electron density distribution in the frame of Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM). Simulation and interpretation of electronic spectra were performed with use of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Description of calculated IR spectra was carried out based on the analysis of the distribution of the potential energy of normal vibrations by natural vibrational coordinates. Sample Availability Not available.
33375265/Utilization of Deep Eutectic Solvents to Reduce the Release of Hazardous Gases to the Atmosphere: A Critical Review The release of certain gases to the atmosphere is controlled in many countries owing to their negative impact on the environment and human health. These gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3). Considering the major contribution of greenhouse gases to global warming and climate change, mitigation of these gases is one of the world's primary challenges. Nevertheless, the commercial processes used to capture these gases suffer from several drawbacks, including the use of volatile solvents, generation of hazardous byproducts, and high-energy demand. Research in green chemistry has resulted in the synthesis of potentially green solvents that are non-toxic, efficient, and environmentally friendly. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are novel solvents that upon wise choice of their constituents can be green and tunable with high biocompatibility, high degradability, and low cost. Consequently, the capture of toxic gases by DESs is promising and environmentally friendly and has attracted much attention during the last decade. Here, we review recent results on capture of these gases using different types of DESs. The effect of different parameters, such as chemical structure, molar ratio, temperature, and pressure, on capture efficiency is discussed.
33374481/Possible Receptor Mechanisms Underlying Cannabidiol Effects on Addictive-like Behaviors in Experimental Animals Substance use disorder (SUD) is a serious public health problem worldwide for which available treatments show limited effectiveness. Since the legalization of cannabis and the approval of cannabidiol (CBD) by the US Food and Drug Administration, therapeutic potential of CBD for the treatment of SUDs and other diseases has been widely explored. In this mini-review article, we first review the history and evidence supporting CBD as a potential pharmacotherapeutic. We then focus on recent progress in preclinical research regarding the pharmacological efficacy of CBD and the underlying receptor mechanisms on addictive-like behavior. Growing evidence indicates that CBD has therapeutic potential in reducing drug reward, as assessed in intravenous drug self-administration, conditioned place preference and intracranial brain-stimulation reward paradigms. In addition, CBD is effective in reducing relapse in experimental animals. Both in vivo and in vitro receptor mechanism studies indicate that CBD may act as a negative allosteric modulator of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor and an agonist of type 2 cannabinoid (CB2), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Through these multiple-receptor mechanisms, CBD is believed to modulate brain dopamine in response to drugs of abuse, leading to attenuation of drug-taking and drug-seeking behavior. While these findings suggest that CBD is a promising therapeutic candidate, further investigation is required to verify its safety, pharmacological efficacy and the underlying receptor mechanisms in both experimental animals and humans.
33379147/Coenzyme Q Depletion Reshapes MCF-7 Cells Metabolism Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in the metabolic flexibility of cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic alterations due to Coenzyme Q depletion in MCF-7 cells. Method: The Coenzyme Q depletion was induced by competitively inhibiting with 4-nitrobenzoate the coq2 enzyme, which catalyzes one of the final reactions in the biosynthetic pathway of CoQ. The bioenergetic and metabolic characteristics of control and coenzyme Q depleted cells were investigated using polarographic and spectroscopic assays. The effect of CoQ depletion on cell growth was analyzed in different metabolic conditions. Results: we showed that cancer cells could cope from energetic and oxidative stress due to mitochondrial dysfunction by reshaping their metabolism. In CoQ depleted cells, the glycolysis was upregulated together with increased glucose consumption, overexpression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, as well as activation of pyruvate kinase (PK). Moreover, the lactate secretion rate was reduced, suggesting that the pyruvate flux was redirected, toward anabolic pathways. Finally, we found a different expression pattern in enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism, and TCA cycle in CoQ depleted cells in comparison to controls. Conclusion: This work elucidated the metabolic alterations in CoQ-depleted cells and provided an insightful understanding of cancer metabolism targeting. 
33396666/Antioxidant and Anti-Proliferative Activity of Essential Oil and Main Components from Leaves of Aloysia polystachya Harvested in Central Chile The aim of this study was to determine, first, the chemical composition of Aloysia polystachya (Griseb) Moldenke essential oil, from leaves harvested in central Chile; and second, its antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. Eight compounds were identified via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, with the most representative being R-carvone (91.03%), R-limonene (4.10%), and dihydrocarvone (1.07%). For Aloysia polystachya essential oil, antioxidant assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), H2O2, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP)) showed good antioxidant activity compared to commercial antioxidant controls; and anti-proliferative assays against three human cancer cell lines (colon, HT-29; prostate, PC-3; and breast, MCF-7) determined an IC50 of 5.85, 6.74, and 9.53 microg/mL, and selectivity indices of 4.75, 4.12, and 2.92 for HT-29, PC-3, and MCF-7, respectively. We also report on assays with CCD 841 CoN (colon epithelial). Overall, results from this study may represent, in the near future, developments for natural-based cancer treatments.
33396673/Dimethyl Fumarate Promotes the Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells after Optic Nerve Injury, Possibly through the Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway This study aimed to verify whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF) promotes the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after optic nerve crush (ONC) accompanied by activation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. We examined changes in the densities of tubulin beta3 (TUBB3)-positive RGCs and the amplitudes of the positive scotopic threshold response (pSTR), reflecting the functional activity of RGCs, recorded on an electroretinogram, with daily administration of DMF, on day 7 after ONC. Furthermore, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses were performed to study the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway using retinas treated with daily administration of DMF. Daily administration of DMF increasedthe density of TUBB3-positive RGCs in a dose-dependent fashion and significantly increased the amplitude of the pSTR. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that DMF administration increased the immunoreactivity for Nrf2 and HO-1, a potent antioxidant enzyme, in RGCs immunolabeled with RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS). Immunoblotting analysis revealed an increase in the nuclear expression of Nrf2 and marked upregulation of HO-1 after DMF administration. These results suggest that DMF has survival-promoting effects in RGC after ONC, possibly via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
33374108/Obtaining Bioactive Compounds from the Coffee Husk (Coffea arabica L.) Using Different Extraction Methods Coffee husks (Coffea arabica L.) are characterized by exhibiting secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds, which can be used as raw material for obtaining bioactive compounds of interest in food. The objective of this study is to evaluate different methods for obtaining the raw material and extracting solutions of bioactive compounds from coffee husks. Water bath and ultrasound-assisted extraction methods were used, using water (100%) or ethanol (100%) or a mixture of both (1:1) as extracting solutions and the form of the raw material was in natura and dehydrated. The extracts were evaluated by their antioxidant potential using DPPH radicals, ABTS, and iron reduction (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)), and later total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, and condensed tannins were quantified the phenolic majority compounds were identified. It was verified that the mixture of water and ethanol (1:1) showed better extraction capacity of the compounds with antioxidant activity and that both conventional (water bath) or unconventional (ultrasound) methods showed satisfactory results. Finally, a satisfactory amount of bioactive compounds was observed in evaluating the chemical composition (total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, condensed tannins, as well as the analysis of the phenolic profile) of these extracts. Corroborating with the results of the antioxidant activities, the best extracting solution was generally the water and ethanol mixture (1:1) using a dehydrated husk and water bath as the best method, presenting higher levels of the bioactive compounds in question, with an emphasis on chlorogenic acid. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of coffee husk as raw material to obtain extracts of bioactive compounds is promising. Last, the conventional method (water bath) and the water and ethanol mixture (1:1) stood out among the methods and extracting solutions used for the dehydrated coffee husk.
33379356/Y-Box Binding Protein-1 Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Sorafenib-Resistant Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancer types worldwide. In cases of advanced-stage disease, sorafenib is considered the treatment of choice. However, resistance to sorafenib remains a major obstacle for effective clinical application. Based on integrated phosphoproteomic and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we identified a transcription factor, Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1), with elevated phosphorylation of Ser102 in sorafenib-resistant HuH-7R cells. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) were activated by sorafenib, which, in turn, increased the phosphorylation level of YB-1. In functional analyses, knockdown of YB-1 led to decreased cell migration and invasion in vitro. At the molecular level, inhibition of YB-1 induced suppression of zinc-finger protein SNAI1 (Snail), twist-related protein 1 (Twist1), zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and vimentin levels, implying a role of YB-1 in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HuH-7R cells. Additionally, YB-1 contributes to morphological alterations resulting from F-actin rearrangement through Cdc42 activation. Mutation analyses revealed that phosphorylation at S102 affects the migratory and invasive potential of HuH-7R cells. Our collective findings suggest that sorafenib promotes YB-1 phosphorylation through effect from the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to significant enhancement of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell metastasis. Elucidation of the specific mechanisms of action of YB-1 may aid in the development of effective strategies to suppress metastasis and overcome resistance.
33375246/The Interfacial Interactions of Glycine and Short Glycine Peptides in Model Membrane Systems The interactions of amino acids and peptides at model membrane interfaces have considerable implications for biological functions, with the ability to act as chemical messengers, hormones, neurotransmitters, and even as antibiotics and anticancer agents. In this study, glycine and the short glycine peptides diglycine, triglycine, and tetraglycine are studied with regards to their interactions at the model membrane interface of Aerosol-OT (AOT) reverse micelles via 1H NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Langmuir trough measurements. It was found that with the exception of monomeric glycine, the peptides prefer to associate between the interface and bulk water pool of the reverse micelle. Monomeric glycine, however, resides with the N-terminus in the ordered interstitial water (stern layer) and the C-terminus located in the bulk water pool of the reverse micelle.
33401732/Sustainable Triazine-Based Dehydro-Condensation Agents for Amide Synthesis Conventional methods employed today for the synthesis of amides often lack of economic and environmental sustainability. Triazine-derived quaternary ammonium salts, e.g., 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride (DMTMM(Cl)), emerged as promising dehydro-condensation agents for amide synthesis, although suffering of limited stability and high costs. In the present work, a simple protocol for the synthesis of amides mediated by 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine (CDMT) and a tert-amine has been described and data are compared to DMTMM(Cl) and other CDMT-derived quaternary ammonium salts (DMT-Ams(X), X: Cl- or ClO4-). Different tert-amines (Ams) were tested for the synthesis of various DMT-Ams(Cl), but only DMTMM(Cl) could be isolated and employed for dehydro-condensation reactions, while all CDMT/tert-amine systems tested were efficient as dehydro-condensation agents. Interestingly, in best reaction conditions, CDMT and 1,4-dimethylpiperazine gave N-phenethyl benzamide in 93% yield in 15 min, with up to half the amount of tert-amine consumption. The efficiency of CDMT/tert-amine was further compared to more stable triazine quaternary ammonium salts having a perchlorate counter anion (DMT-Ams(ClO4)). Overall CDMT/tert-amine systems appear to be a viable and more economical alternative to most dehydro-condensation agents employed today.
33396808/Combined Experimental and Theoretical Insights into the Corrosion Inhibition Activity on Carbon Steel Iron of Phosphonic Acids The inhibition effect of N,N'-phosphonomethylglycine (PMG) and vinyl phosphonic acid (VPA) on the 3% NaCl acidic solution corrosion of carbon steel iron was studied at different immersion times by potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and computational methods. It is found from the polarization studies that PMG and VPA behave as mixed-type inhibitors in NaCl. Values of charge transfer resistance (Rct) and double layer capacitance (Cdl) in the absence and presence of inhibitors are determined. The PMG and VPA inhibitors were capable of inhibiting the corrosion process up to  91% and  85%, respectively. In the presence of PMG, the synergic effect of chlorine ions was observed. Density functional theory (DFT) was engaged to establish the adsorption site of PMG, VPA, and their deprotonated states. For studied compounds, the resulted values of ELUMO, EHOMO, energy gap ( E), dipole moment (mu), electronic hardness (eta), global softness (sigma), electrophilic index (omega), and the electronic potential map are in concordance with the experimental data results regarding their corrosion inhibition behavior and adsorption on the metal surface.
33374449/New 1,3-Disubstituted Benzo[h]Isoquinoline Cyclen-Based Ligand Platform: Synthesis, Eu3+ Multiphoton Sensitization and Imaging Applications The development of lanthanide-based luminescent probes with a long emission lifetime has the potential to revolutionize imaging-based diagnostic techniques. By a rational design strategy taking advantage of computational predictions, a novel, water-soluble Eu3+ complex from a cyclen-based ligand bearing 1,3-disubstituted benzo[h]isoquinoline arms was realized. The ligand has been obtained overcoming the lack of reactivity of position 3 of the isoquinoline moiety. Notably, steric hindrance of the heteroaromatic chromophore allowed selective and stoichiometry-controlled insertion of two or three antennas on the cyclen platform without any protection strategy. The complex bears a fourth heptanoic arm for easy conjugation to biomolecules. This new chromophore allowed the sensitization of the metal center either with one or two photons excitation. The suitability as a luminescent bioprobe was validated by imaging BMI1 oncomarker in lung carcinoma cells following an established immunofluorescence approach. The use of a conventional epifluorescence microscope equipped with a linear structured illumination module disclosed a simple and inexpensive way to image confocally Ln-bioprobes by single photon excitation in the 350-400 nm window, where ordinary confocal systems have no excitation sources.
33401594/Coumarin's Anti-Quorum Sensing Activity Can Be Enhanced When Combined with Other Plant-Derived Small Molecules Coumarins are class of natural aromatic compounds based on benzopyrones (2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones). They are identified as secondary metabolites in about 150 different plant species. The ability of coumarins to inhibit cell-to-cell communication in bacterial communities (quorum sensing; QS) has been previously described. Coumarin and its derivatives in plant extracts are often found together with other small molecules that show anti-QS properties too. The aim of this study was to find the most effective combinations of coumarins and small plant-derived molecules identified in various plants extracts that inhibit QS in Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532 violacein production bioassay. The coumarin and its derivatives: 7-hydroxycoumarin, 7.8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, were included in the study. Combinations of coumarins with gamma-octalactone, 4-hexyl-1.3-benzenediol, 3.4.5-trimethoxyphenol and vanillin, previously identified in oak bark (Quercus cortex), and eucalyptus leaves (Eucalyptus viminalis) extracts, were analyzed in a bioassay. When testing two-component compositions, it was shown that 7.8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, 4-hexyl-1.3-benzendiol, and gamma-octalactone showed a supra-additive anti-QS effect. Combinations of all three molecules resulted in a three- to five-fold reduction in the concentration of each compound needed to achieve EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) against QS in C. violaceum ATCC 31532.
33396590/Antimicrobial Potential of Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles by Aaronsohnia factorovskyi Extract The green biosynthesis of nanoparticles by plant extracts is an attractive and promising technique for medicinal applications. In the current study, we chose one of the daisy plants, Aaronsohnia factorovskyi (which grows in the Najd region, Saudi Arabia), to investigate its anti-microbial efficacy, in combination with silver nanoparticles. The biosynthesized nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, (Gram-negative) using the disc diffusion method, while the antifungal activity was assessed against Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Helminthosporium rostratum, and Alternaria alternata. The potential phytoconstituents of the plant extracts were identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques, the Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, and Zeta potential analysis. The current study revealed the ability of the tested plant extract to convert silver ions to silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 104-140 nm. Biogenic Aaronsohnia factorovskyi-silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs) showed significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with inhibition zone diameter to 19.00 +- 2.94 mm, and antifungal activity against Fusarium solani, which reduced the growth of fungal yarn to 1.5 mm. The innovation of the present study is that the green synthesis of NPs, which is simple, cost-effective, provides stable nano-materials, and can be an alternative for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanoparticles.
33379387/Osteoprotective Effects of Loganic Acid on Osteoblastic and Osteoclastic Cells and Osteoporosis-Induced Mice Osteoporosis is a common disease caused by an imbalance of processes between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts in postmenopausal women. The roots of Gentiana lutea L. (GL) are reported to have beneficial effects on various human diseases related to liver functions and gastrointestinal motility, as well as on arthritis. Here, we fractionated and isolated bioactive constituent(s) responsible for anti-osteoporotic effects of GL root extract. A single phytochemical compound, loganic acid, was identified as a candidate osteoprotective agent. Its anti-osteoporotic effects were examined in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with loganic acid significantly increased osteoblastic differentiation in preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells by promoting alkaline phosphatase activity and increasing mRNA expression levels of bone metabolic markers such as Alpl, Bglap, and Sp7. However, loganic acid inhibited osteoclast differentiation of primary-cultured monocytes derived from mouse bone marrow. For in vivo experiments, the effect of loganic acid on ovariectomized (OVX) mice was examined for 12 weeks. Loganic acid prevented OVX-induced bone mineral density loss and improved bone structural properties in osteoporotic model mice. These results suggest that loganic acid may be a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of osteoporosis.
33375375/Terminal Mono- and Bis-Conjugates of Oligonucleotides with Closo-Dodecaborate: Synthesis and Physico-Chemical Properties Oligonucleotide conjugates with boron clusters have found applications in different fields of molecular biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine as potential agents for boron neutron capture therapy, siRNA components, and antisense agents. Particularly, the closo-dodecaborate anion represents a high-boron-containing residue with remarkable chemical stability and low toxicity, and is suitable for the engineering of different constructs for biomedicine and molecular biology. In the present work, we synthesized novel oligonucleotide conjugates of closo-dodecaborate attached to the 5'-, 3'-, or both terminal positions of DNA, RNA, 2'-O-Me RNA, and 2'-F-Py RNA oligomers. For their synthesis, we employed click reaction with the azido derivative of closo-dodecaborate. The key physicochemical characteristics of the conjugates have been investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography, gel electrophoresis, UV thermal melting, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Incorporation of closo-dodecaborate residues at the 3'-end of all oligomers stabilized their complementary complexes, whereas analogous 5'-modification decreased duplex stability. Two boron clusters attached to the opposite ends of the oligomer only slightly influence the stability of complementary complexes of RNA oligonucleotide and its 2'-O-methyl and 2'-fluoro analogs. On the contrary, the same modification of DNA oligonucleotides significantly destabilized the DNA/DNA duplex but gave a strong stabilization of the duplex with an RNA target. According to circular dichroism spectroscopy results, two terminal closo-dodecaborate residues cause a prominent structural rearrangement of complementary complexes with a substantial shift from the B-form to the A-form of the double helix. The revealed changes of key characteristics of oligonucleotides caused by incorporation of terminal boron clusters, such as the increase of hydrophobicity, change of duplex stability, and prominent structural changes for DNA conjugates, should be taken into account for the development of antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, or aptamers bearing boron clusters. These features may also be used for engineering of developing NA constructs with pre-defined properties.
33396610/Linear Copolymers Based on Choline Ionic Liquid Carrying Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs: Influence of Anion Type on Physicochemical Properties and Drug Release In this study, drug nanocarriers were designed using linear copolymers with different contents of cholinium-based ionic liquid units, i.e., [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (TMAMA/Cl: 25, 50, and 75 mol%). The amphiphilicity of the copolymers was evaluated on the basis of their critical micelle concentration (CMC = 0.055-0.079 mg/mL), and their hydrophilicities were determined by water contact angles (WCA = 17 -46 ). The chloride anions in the polymer chain were involved in ionic exchange reactions to introduce pharmaceutical anions, i.e., p-aminosalicylate (PAS-), clavulanate (CLV-), piperacillin (PIP-), and fusidate (FUS-), which are established antibacterial agents for treating lung and respiratory diseases. The exchange reaction efficiency decreased in the following order: CLV- > PAS- > PIP- >> FUS-. The hydrophilicity of the ionic drug conjugates was slightly reduced, as indicated by the increased WCA values. The major fraction of particles with sizes ~20 nm was detected in systems with at least 50% TMAMA carrying PAS or PIP. The influence of the drug character and carrier structure was also observed in the kinetic profiles of the release processes driven by the exchange with phosphate anions (0.5-6.4 mug/mL). The obtained polymer-drug ionic conjugates (especially that with PAS) are promising carriers with potential medical applications.
33374464/Metabolite Profiling of Manilkara zapota L. Leaves by High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Coupled with ESI and APCI and In Vitro Antioxidant Activity, alpha-Glucosidase, and Elastase Inhibition Assays High-resolution mass spectrometry equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources was used to enhance the characterization of phytochemicals of ethanol extracts of Manilkara zapota L. leaves (ZLE). Sugar compounds, dicarboxylic acids, compounds of phenolic acids and flavonoids groups, and other phytochemicals were detected from the leaves. Antioxidant activity and inhibition potentiality of ZLE against alpha-glucosidase enzyme, and elastase enzyme activities were evaluated in in vitro analysis. ZLE significantly inhibited activities of alpha-glucosidase enzyme at a lower concentration (IC50 2.51 +- 0.15 microg/mL). Glucose uptake in C2C12 cells was significantly enhanced by 42.13 +- 0.15% following the treatment with ZLE at 30 microg/mL. It also exhibited potential antioxidant activities and elastase enzyme inhibition activity (IC50 27.51 +- 1.70 microg/mL). Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) detected more m/z peaks than electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and both ionization techniques illustrated the biological activities of the detected compounds more thoroughly compared to single-mode analysis. Our findings suggest that APCI along with ESI is a potential ionization technique for metabolite profiling, and ZLE has the potential in managing diabetes by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase activity and enhancing glucose uptake.
33383879/Fabrication and Characterization of Nanocomposite Flexible Membranes of PVA and Fe3O4 Composite polymer membranes of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were produced in this work. X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated the formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles of cubic structures. The nanoparticles were synthesized by a coprecipitation technique and added to PVA solutions with different concentrations. The solutions were then used to generate flexible membranes by a solution casting method. The size and shape of the nanoparticles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average size of the nanoparticles was  nm. Raman spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were utilized to investigate the structure of the membranes, as well as their vibration modes. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated the thermal stability of the membranes and the crystallinity degree. Electrical characteristics of the thin membranes were examined using impedance spectroscopy as a function of the nanoparticles' concentrations and temperatures. The resistivity of the fabricated flexible membranes was possible to adjust by controlled doping with suitable concentrations of nanoparticles. The activation energy decreased with the nanoparticles' concentrations due to the increase in charge carriers' concentrations. Therefore, the fabricated membranes may be applied for practical applications that involve the recycling of nanoparticles for multiple application cycles.
33401664/Transamidation of Amides and Amidation of Esters by Selective N-C(O)/O-C(O) Cleavage Mediated by Air- and Moisture-Stable Half-Sandwich Nickel(II)-NHC Complexes The formation of amide bonds represents one of the most fundamental processes in organic synthesis. Transition-metal-catalyzed activation of acyclic twisted amides has emerged as an increasingly powerful platform in synthesis. Herein, we report the transamidation of N-activated twisted amides by selective N-C(O) cleavage mediated by air- and moisture-stable half-sandwich Ni(II)-NHC (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbenes) complexes. We demonstrate that the readily available cyclopentadienyl complex, [CpNi(IPr)Cl] (IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene), promotes highly selective transamidation of the N-C(O) bond in twisted N-Boc amides with non-nucleophilic anilines. The reaction provides access to secondary anilides via the non-conventional amide bond-forming pathway. Furthermore, the amidation of activated phenolic and unactivated methyl esters mediated by [CpNi(IPr)Cl] is reported. This study sets the stage for the broad utilization of well-defined, air- and moisture-stable Ni(II)-NHC complexes in catalytic amide bond-forming protocols by unconventional C(acyl)-N and C(acyl)-O bond cleavage reactions.
33401641/Selective Extraction of Sinapic Acid Derivatives from Mustard Seed Meal by Acting on pH: Toward a High Antioxidant Activity Rich Extract The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the pH on the extraction of sinapic acid and its derivatives from mustard seed meal. Solutions of acidic pH (pH 2), basic pH (pH 12) and distilled water (uncontrolled pH ~ 4.5) were tested at different percentages of ethanol. The maximum extraction yield for sinapic acid (13.22 micromol/g of dry matter (DM)) was obtained with a buffered aqueous solution at pH 12. For ethyl sinapate, the maximum extraction yield reached 9.81 micromol/g DM with 70% ethanol/buffered aqueous solution at pH 12. The maximum extraction yield of sinapine (15.73 micromol/g DM) was achieved with 70% ethanol/buffered aqueous solution at pH 2. The antioxidant activity of each extract was assessed by DPPH assay; the results indicated that the extracts obtained at pH 12 and at low ethanol percentages (<50%) exhibit a higher antioxidant activity than extracts obtained at acidic conditions. Maximum antioxidant activity was reached at pH 12 with buffer solution (11.37 mg of Trolox Equivalent/g DM), which confirms that sinapic acid-rich fractions exhibit a higher antioxidant activity. Thus, to obtain rich antioxidant extracts, it is suggested to promote the presence of sinapic acid in the extracts.
33374450/Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Bicalutamide Analogues for the Potential Treatment of Prostate Cancer The androgen receptor (AR) is a pivotal target for the treatment of prostate cancer (PC) even when the disease progresses toward androgen-independent or castration-resistant forms. In this study, a series of 15 bicalutamide analogues (sulfide, deshydroxy, sulfone, and O-acetylated) were prepared and their antiproliferative activity evaluated against four different human prostate cancer cell lines (22Rv1, DU-145, LNCaP, and VCap). Bicalutamide and enzalutamide were used as positive controls. Seven of these compounds displayed remarkable enhancement in anticancer activity across the four PC cell lines. The deshydroxy analogue (16) was the most active compound with IC50 = 6.59-10.86 microM. Molecular modeling offers a plausible explanation of the higher activity of the sulfide analogues compared to their sulfone counterparts.
33379335/gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Suppresses Iron Transportation from Roots to Shoots in Rice Seedlings by Inducing Aerenchyma Formation gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a widely distributed non-protein amino acid mediated the regulation of nitrate uptake and Al3+ tolerance in plants. However, there are few reports about the involvement of GABA in the regulation of iron (Fe) acquisition and translocation. Here, we show that GABA regulates Fe homeostasis in rice seedlings. Exogenous GABA decreased the chlorophyll concentration in leaves, with or without Fe supply. Over-expression of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) gene, coding a crucial enzyme of GABA production, elevated endogenous GABA content and caused more leaf chlorosis than wild type (Nipponbare). GABA inhibited Fe transportation from roots to shoots and GABA application elevated the expression levels of Fe deficiency (FD)-related genes under conditions of Fe-sufficiency (FS), suggesting that GABA is a regulator of Fe translocation. Using Perls' blue staining, we found that more ferric iron (Fe3+) was deposited in the epidermal cells of roots treated with GABA compared with control roots. Anatomic section analysis showed that GABA treatment induced more aerenchyma formation compared with the control. Aerenchyma facilitated the oxidization of soluble ferrous iron (Fe2+) into insoluble Fe3+, resulted in Fe precipitation in the epidermis, and inhibited the transportation of Fe from roots to shoots.
33383774/Synthesis of Galectin Inhibitors by Regioselective 3'-O-Sulfation of Vanillin Lactosides Obtained under Phase Transfer Catalysis Vanillin-based lactoside derivatives were synthetized using phase-transfer catalyzed reactions from per-O-acetylated lactosyl bromide. The aldehyde group of the vanillin moiety was then modified to generate a series of related analogs having variable functionalities in the para- position of the aromatic residue. The corresponding unprotected lactosides, obtained by Zemplen transesterification, were regioselectively 3'-O-sulfated using tin chemistry activation followed by treatment with sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex (Men3N-SO3). Additional derivatives were also prepared from the vanillin's aldehyde using a Knoevenagel reaction to provide extended alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid which was next reduced to the saturated counterpart.
33375687/Alkaloids with Anti-Onchocercal Activity from Voacanga africana Stapf (Apocynaceae): Identification and Molecular Modeling A new iboga-vobasine-type isomeric bisindole alkaloid named voacamine A (1), along with eight known compounds:voacangine (2), voacristine (3), coronaridine (4), tabernanthine (5), iboxygaine (6), voacamine (7), voacorine (8) and conoduramine (9):were isolated from the stem bark of Voacangaafricana. The structures of the compounds were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 were found to inhibit the motility of both the microfilariae (Mf) and adult male worms of Onchocerca ochengi, in a dose-dependent manner, but were only moderately active on the adult female worms upon biochemical assessment at 30 muM drug concentrations. The IC50 values of the isolates are 2.49-5.49 microM for microfilariae and 3.45-17.87 microM for adult males. Homology modeling was used to generate a 3D model of the O. ochengi thioredoxin reductase target and docking simulation, followed by molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations attempted to offer an explanation of the anti-onchocercal structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the isolated compounds. These alkaloids are new potential leads for the development of antifilarial drugs. The results of this study validate the traditional use of V. africana in the treatment of human onchocerciasis.
33396688/Curcumin Prevents Cerebellar Hypoplasia and Restores the Behavior in Hyperbilirubinemic Gunn Rat by a Pleiotropic Effect on the Molecular Effectors of Brain Damage Bilirubin toxicity to the central nervous system (CNS) is responsible for severe and permanent neurologic damage, resulting in hearing loss, cognitive, and movement impairment. Timely and effective management of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia by phototherapy or exchange transfusion is crucial for avoiding permanent neurological consequences, but these therapies are not always possible, particularly in low-income countries. To explore alternative options, we investigated a pharmaceutical approach focused on protecting the CNS from pigment toxicity, independently from serum bilirubin level. To this goal, we tested the ability of curcumin, a nutraceutical already used with relevant results in animal models as well as in clinics in other diseases, in the Gunn rat, the spontaneous model of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Curcumin treatment fully abolished the landmark cerebellar hypoplasia of Gunn rat, restoring the histological features, and reverting the behavioral abnormalities present in the hyperbilirubinemic rat. The protection was mediated by a multi-target action on the main bilirubin-induced pathological mechanism ongoing CNS damage (inflammation, redox imbalance, and glutamate neurotoxicity). If confirmed by independent studies, the result suggests the potential of curcumin as an alternative/complementary approach to bilirubin-induced brain damage in the clinical scenario.
33375633/Chemical Composition, Antioxidant and Anticancer Activities of Leptocarpha rivularis DC Flower Extracts An evaluation of antioxidant and anticancer activity was screened in Leptocarpha rivularis DC flower extracts using four solvents (n-hexane (Hex), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (AcOEt), and ethanol (EtOH)). Extracts were compared for total extract flavonoids and phenol contents, antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP), total reactive antioxidant properties (TRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)) across a determined value of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), and cell viability (the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay). The most active extracts were analyzed by chromatographic analysis (GC/MS) and tested for apoptotic pathways. Extracts from Hex, DCM and AcOEt reduced cell viability, caused changes in cell morphology, affected mitochondrial membrane permeability, and induced caspase activation in tumor cell lines HT-29, PC-3, and MCF-7. These effects were generally less pronounced in the HEK-293 cell line (nontumor cells), indicating clear selectivity towards tumor cell lines. We attribute likely extract activity to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones, in combination with other components like steroids and flavonoids.
33375511/Terpyridine-Functionalized Calixarenes: Synthesis, Characterization and Anion Sensing Applications Lanthanide complexes have been developed and are reported herein. These complexes were derived from a terpyridine-functionalized calix[4]arene ligand, chelated with Tb3+ and Eu3+. Synthesis of these complexes was achieved in two steps from a calix[4]arene derivative: (1) amide coupling of a calix[4]arene bearing carboxylic acid functionalities and (2) metallation with a lanthanide triflate salt. The ligand and its complexes were characterized by NMR (1H and 13C), fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as MS. The photophysical properties of these complexes were studied; high molar absorptivity values, modest quantum yields and luminescence lifetimes on the ms timescale were obtained. Anion binding results in a change in the photophysical properties of the complexes. The anion sensing ability of the Tb(III) complex was evaluated via visual detection, UV-vis and fluorescence studies. The sensor was found to be responsive towards a variety of anions, and large binding constants were obtained for the coordination of anions to the sensor.
33375360/BRAF Controls the Effects of Metformin on Neuroblast Cell Divisions in C. elegans Metformin has demonstrated substantial potential for use in cancer treatments. Liver kinase B (LKB)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR are reported to be the main targets of metformin in relation to its ability to prevent cancer cell proliferation. However, the role of metformin in the control of neoplastic cancer cell growth is possibly independent of LKB-AMPK and mTOR. Using C. elegans as a model, we found that the neuronal Q-cell divisions in L1-arrested worms were suppressed following metformin treatment in AMPK-deficient mutants, suggesting that the mechanism by which metformin suppresses these cell divisions is independent of AMPK. Our results showed that the mTOR pathway indeed played a role in controlling germ cell proliferation, but it was not involved in the neuronal Q-cell divisions occurring in L1-arrested worms. We found that the neuronal Q-cells divisions were held at G1/S cell stage by metformin in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrated that metformin could reduce the phosphorylation activity of BRAF and block the BRAF-MAPK oncogenesis pathway to regulate neuronal Q-cell divisions during L1 arrest. This work discloses a new mechanism by which metformin treatment acts to promote neuronal cancer prevention, and these results will help promote the study of the anticancer mechanisms underlying metformin treatments.
33396955/Hydrodechlorination of 4-Chlorophenol on Pd-Fe Catalysts on Mesoporous ZrO2SiO2 Support A mesoporous support based on silica and zirconia (ZS) was used to prepare monometallic 1 wt% Pd/ZS, 10 wt% Fe/ZS, and bimetallic FePd/ZS catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by TPR-H2, XRD, SEM-EDS, TEM, AAS, and DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed CO after H2 reduction in situ and tested in hydrodechlorination of environmental pollutant 4-chlorophelol in aqueous solution at 30  C. The bimetallic catalyst demonstrated an excellent activity, selectivity to phenol and stability in 10 consecutive runs. FePd/ZS has exceptional reducibility due to the high dispersion of palladium and strong interaction between FeOx and palladium, confirmed by TPR-H2, DRIFT spectroscopy, XRD, and TEM. Its reduction occurs during short-time treatment with hydrogen in an aqueous solution at RT. The Pd/ZS was more resistant to reduction but can be activated by aqueous phenol solution and H2. The study by DRIFT spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on Pd/ZS reduced in harsh (H2, 330  C), medium (H2, 200  C) and mild conditions (H2 + aqueous solution of phenol) helped to identify the reasons of the reducing action of phenol solution. It was found that phenol provided fast transformation of Pd+ to Pd0. Pd/ZS also can serve as an active and stable catalyst for 4-PhCl transformation to phenol after proper reduction.
33379217/Possible Adverse Effects of Food Additive E171 (Titanium Dioxide) Related to Particle Specific Human Toxicity, Including the Immune System Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as a food additive (E171) and can be found in sauces, icings, and chewing gums, as well as in personal care products such as toothpaste and pharmaceutical tablets. Along with the ubiquitous presence of TiO2 and recent insights into its potentially hazardous properties, there are concerns about its application in commercially available products. Especially the nano-sized particle fraction (<100 nm) of TiO2 warrants a more detailed evaluation of potential adverse health effects after ingestion. A workshop organized by the Dutch Office for Risk Assessment and Research (BuRO) identified uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the gastrointestinal absorption of TiO2, its distribution, the potential for accumulation, and induction of adverse health effects such as inflammation, DNA damage, and tumor promotion. This review aims to identify and evaluate recent toxicological studies on food-grade TiO2 and nano-sized TiO2 in ex-vivo, in-vitro, and in-vivo experiments along the gastrointestinal route, and to postulate an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) following ingestion. Additionally, this review summarizes recommendations and outcomes of the expert meeting held by the BuRO in 2018, in order to contribute to the hazard identification and risk assessment process of ingested TiO2.
33375378/TiCl4 Dissolved in Ionic Liquid Mixtures from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations To gain a deeper understanding of the TiCl solvation effects in multi-component ionic liquids, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [CCIm], tetrafluoroborate [BF], chloride [Cl] both with and without water and titanium tetrachloride TiCl. Complex interactions between cations and anions are observed in all investigated systems. By further addition of water and TiCl this complex interaction network is extended. Observations of the radial distribution functions and number integrals show that water and TiCl not only compete with each other to interact mainly with [Cl], which strongly influences the cation-[BF] interaction, but also interact with each other, which leads to the fact that in certain systems the cation-anion interaction is enhanced. Further investigations of the Voronoi polyhedra analysis have demonstrated that water has a greater impact on the nanosegregated system than TiCl which is also due to the fact of the shear amount of water relative to all other components and its higher mobility compared to TiCl. Overall, the polar network of the IL mixture collapses by including water and TiCl. In the case of [Cl] chloride enters the water continuum, while [BF] remains largely unaffected, which deeply affects the interaction of the ionic liquid (IL) network.
33379394/Oxygen Transport during Ex Situ Machine Perfusion of Donor Livers Using Red Blood Cells or Artificial Oxygen Carriers Oxygenated ex situ machine perfusion of donor livers is an alternative for static cold preservation that can be performed at temperatures from 0  C to 37  C. Organ metabolism depends on oxygen to produce adenosine triphosphate and temperatures below 37  C reduce the metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. The transport and delivery of oxygen in machine perfusion are key determinants in preserving organ viability and cellular function. Oxygen delivery is more challenging than carbon dioxide removal, and oxygenation of the perfusion fluid is temperature dependent. The maximal oxygen content of water-based solutions is inversely related to the temperature, while cellular oxygen demand correlates positively with temperature. Machine perfusion above 20  C will therefore require an oxygen carrier to enable sufficient oxygen delivery to the liver. Human red blood cells are the most physiological oxygen carriers. Alternative artificial oxygen transporters are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbons, and an extracellular oxygen carrier derived from a marine invertebrate. We describe the principles of oxygen transport, delivery, and consumption in machine perfusion for donor livers using different oxygen carrier-based perfusion solutions and we discuss the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of these carriers and their use.
33396841/Biological Insights of Fluoroaryl-2,2'-Bichalcophene Compounds on Multi-Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Resistance of bacteria to multiple antibiotics is a significant health problem; hence, to continually respond to this challenge, different antibacterial agents must be constantly discovered. In this work, fluoroaryl-2,2'-bichalcophene derivatives were chemically synthesized and their biological activities were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The impact of the investigated bichalcophene derivatives was studied on the ultrastructural level via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), molecular level via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method and on the biofilm inhibition via the electrochemical biosensors. Arylbichalcophenes' antibacterial activity against S. aureus was affected by the presence and location of fluorine atoms. The fluorobithiophene derivative MA-1156 displayed the best minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 16 microM among the tested fluoroarylbichalcophenes. Over a period of seven days, S. aureus did not develop any resistance against the tested fluoroarylbichalcophenes at higher concentrations. The impact of fluoroarylbichalcophenes was strong on S. aureus protein pattern showing high degrees of polymorphism. SEM micrographs of S. aureus cells treated with fluoroarylbichalcophenes displayed smaller cell-sizes, fewer numbers, arranged in a linear form and some of them were damaged when compared to the untreated cells. The bioelectrochemical measurements demonstrated the strong sensitivity of S. aureus cells to the tested fluoroarylbichalcophenes and an antibiofilm agent. Eventually, these fluoroarylbichalcophene compounds especially the MA-1156 could be recommended as effective antibacterial agents.
33374358/Tedizolid-Cyclodextrin System as Delayed-Release Drug Delivery with Antibacterial Activity Progressive increase in bacterial resistance has caused an urgent need to introduce new antibiotics, one of them being oxazolidinones with their representative tedizolid. Despite the broad spectrum of activity of the parent tedizolid, it is characterized by low water solubility, which limits its use. The combination of the active molecule with a multifunctional excipient, which is cyclodextrins, allows preservation of its pharmacological activity and modification of its physicochemical properties. Therefore, the aim of the study was to change the dissolution rate and permeability through the model membrane of tedizolid by formation of solid dispersions with a cyclodextrin. The research included identification of tedizolid-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (tedizolid/HP-beta-CD) inclusion complex by thermal method (Differential Scanning Colorimetry), spectroscopic methods (powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy), and molecular docking. The second part of the research concerned the physicochemical properties (dissolution and permeability) and the biological properties of the system in terms of its microbiological activity. An increase in the dissolution rate was observed in the presence of cyclodextrin, while maintaining a high permeation coefficient and high microbiological activity. The proposed approach is an opportunity to develop drug delivery systems used in the treatment of resistant bacterial infections, in which, in addition to modifying the physicochemical properties caused by cyclodextrin, we observe a favorable change in the pharmacological potential of the bioactives.
33379212/Alterations in Rat Accumbens Dopamine, Endocannabinoids and GABA Content During WIN55,212-2 Treatment: The Role of Ghrelin The endocannabinoid/CB1R system as well as the central ghrelin signalling with its growth hormone secretagogoue receptors (GHS-R1A) are importantly involved in food intake and reward/reinforcement processing and show distinct overlaps in distribution within the relevant brain regions including the hypothalamus (food intake), the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAC) (reward/reinforcement). The significant mutual interaction between these systems in food intake has been documented; however, the possible role of ghrelin/GHS-R1A in the cannabinoid reinforcement effects and addiction remain unclear. Therefore, the principal aim of the present study was to investigate whether pretreatment with GHS-R1A antagonist/JMV2959 could reduce the CB1R agonist/WIN55,212-2-induced dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens shell (NACSh), which is considered a crucial trigger impulse of the addiction process. The synthetic aminoalklylindol cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 administration into the posterior VTA induced significant accumbens dopamine release, which was significantly reduced by the 3 mg/kg i.p. JMV2959 pretreatment. Simultaneously, the cannabinoid-increased accumbens dopamine metabolic turnover was significantly augmented by the JMV2959 pretreament. The intracerebral WIN55,212-2 administration also increased the endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide/anandamide and the 2-arachidonoylglycerol/2-AG extracellular levels in the NACSh, which was moderately but significantly attenuated by the JMV2959 pretreatment. Moreover, the cannabinoid-induced decrease in accumbens gamma-aminobutyric acid/gamma-aminobutyric acid levels was reversed by the JMV2959 pretreatment. The behavioural study in the LABORAS cage showed that 3 mg/kg JMV2959 pretreatment also significantly reduced the systemic WIN55,212-2-induced behavioural stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the ghrelin/GHS-R1A system significantly participates in the rewarding/reinforcing effects of the cannabinoid/CB1 agonist that are involved in cannabinoid addiction processing.
33379168/Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids Induce Cell Death in Human HepaRG Cells in a Structure-Dependent Manner Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of secondary metabolites produced in various plant species as a defense mechanism against herbivores. PAs consist of a necine base, which is esterified with one or two necine acids. Humans are exposed to PAs by consumption of contaminated food. PA intoxication in humans causes acute and chronic hepatotoxicity. It is considered that enzymatic PA toxification in hepatocytes is structure-dependent. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the induction of PA-induced cell death associated with apoptosis activation. Therefore, 22 structurally different PAs were analyzed concerning the disturbance of cell viability in the metabolically competent human hepatoma cell line HepaRG. The chosen PAs represent the main necine base structures and the different esterification types. Open-chained and cyclic heliotridine- and retronecine-type diesters induced strong cytotoxic effects, while treatment of HepaRG with monoesters did not affect cell viability. For more detailed investigation of apoptosis induction, comprising caspase activation and gene expression analysis, 14 PA representatives were selected. The proapoptotic effects were in line with the potency observed in cell viability studies. In vitro data point towards a strong structure-activity relationship whose effectiveness needs to be investigated in vivo and can then be the basis for a structure-associated risk assessment.
33401775/Water-in-Oil-in-Water Nanoemulsions Containing Temulawak (Curcuma xanthorriza Roxb) and Red Dragon Fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus) Extracts Hydrophobic curcumin in temulawak extract and hydrophilic betacyanin in red dragon fruit extract are high-value bioactive compounds with extensive applications in functional food. In this study, these extracts were encapsulated in water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) nanoemulsions as a delivery system using a two-step high-energy emulsification method. PGPR and Span 20 were used as lipophilic emulsifiers for the primary w/o emulsion. The most stable w/o/w formulation with the least oil phase separation of 5% v/v consisted of w/o emulsion (15% w/w) and Tween 80 (1.5% w/w) as hydrophilic emulsifier. The formulation was characterized by a 189-nm mean droplet diameter, 0.16 polydispersity index, and -32 mV zeta potential. The freeze-thaw stability may be attributed to the combination of low w/o emulsion content and high Tween 80 concentration in the outer water phase of the w/o/w nanoemulsions used in this study. The IC50 values of the nanoemulsion and the red dragon fruit extract were similar. It means that the higher concentration of curcumin in the nanoemulsions and the lower IC50 value of temulawak extract ensured sufficient antioxidant activities of the w/o/w nanoemulsions.
33375289/DNA-Binding Capabilities and Anticancer Activities of Ruthenium(II) Cymene Complexes with (Poly)cyclic Aromatic Diamine Ligands Ruthenium(II) arene complexes of the general formula [RuCl(eta6-p-cymene)(diamine)]PF6 (diamine = 1,2-diaminobenzene (1), 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (2), 9,10-diaminophenanthrene (3), 2,3-diaminophenazine (4), and 1,2-diaminoanthraquinone (5) were synthesized. Chloro/aqua exchange was evaluated experimentally for complexes 1 and 2. The exchange process was investigated theoretically for all complexes, revealing relatively fast exchange with no significant influence from the polycyclic aromatic diamines. The calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) binding of the complexes increased dramatically upon extending the aromatic component of the diamines, as evaluated by changes in absorption spectra upon titration with different concentrations of CT-DNA. An intercalation binding mode was established for the complexes using the increase in the relative viscosity of the CT-DNA following addition of complexes 1 and 2. Theoretical studies showed strong preference for replacement of water by guanine for all the complexes, and relatively strong Ru-Nguanine bonds. The plane of the aromatic systems can assume angles that support non-classical interactions with the DNA and covalent binding, leading to higher binding affinities. The ruthenium arenes illustrated in this study have promising anticancer activities, with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values comparable to or better than cisplatin against three cell lines.
33379343/Theanine, Antistress Amino Acid in Tea Leaves, Causes Hippocampal Metabolic Changes and Antidepressant Effects in Stress-Loaded Mice By comprehensively measuring changes in metabolites in the hippocampus of stress-loaded mice, we investigated the reasons for stress vulnerability and the effect of theanine, i.e., an abundant amino acid in tea leaves, on the metabolism. Stress sensitivity was higher in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 10 (SAMP10) mice than in normal ddY mice when these mice were loaded with stress on the basis of territorial consciousness in males. Group housing was used as the low-stress condition reference. Among the statistically altered metabolites, depression-related kynurenine and excitability-related histamine were significantly higher in SAMP10 mice than in ddY mice. In contrast, carnosine, which has antidepressant-like activity, and ornithine, which has antistress effects, were significantly lower in SAMP10 mice than in ddY mice. The ingestion of theanine, an excellent antistress amino acid, modulated the levels of kynurenine, histamine, and carnosine only in the stress-loaded SAMP10 mice and not in the group-housing mice. Depression-like behavior was suppressed in mice that had ingested theanine only under stress loading. Taken together, changes in these metabolites, such as kynurenine, histamine, carnosine, and ornithine, were suggested to be associated with the stress vulnerability and depression-like behavior of stressed SAMP10 mice. It was also shown that theanine action appears in the metabolism of mice only under stress loading. 
33374288/S-Adenosyl-l-Methionine Overcomes uL3-Mediated Drug Resistance in p53 Deleted Colon Cancer Cells Purpose: In order to study novel therapeutic approaches taking advantage of natural compounds showing anticancer and anti-proliferative effects, we focused our interest on S-adenosyl-l-methionine, a naturally occurring sulfur-containing nucleoside synthesized from adenosine triphosphate and methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase, and its potential in overcoming drug resistance in colon cancer cells devoid of p53. Results: In the present study, we demonstrated that S-adenosyl-l-methionine overcomes uL3-mediated drug resistance in p53 deleted colon cancer cells. In particular, we demonstrated that S-adenosyl-l-methionine causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase; inhibits autophagy; augments reactive oxygen species; and induces apoptosis in these cancer cells. Conclusions: Results reported in this paper led us to propose S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a potential promising agent for cancer therapy by examining p53 and uL3 profiles in tumors to yield a better clinical outcomes.
33401696/Alkaloids Analysis of Habranthus cardenasianus (Amaryllidaceae), Anti-Cholinesterase Activity and Biomass Production by Propagation Strategies Plants in the Amaryllidaceae family synthesize a diversity of bioactive alkaloids. Some of these plant species are not abundant and have a low natural multiplication rate. The aims of this work were the alkaloids analysis of a Habranthus cardenasianus bulbs extract, the evaluation of its inhibitory activity against cholinesterases, and to test several propagation strategies for biomass production. Eleven compounds were characterized by GC-MS in the alkaloid extract, which showed a relatively high proportion of tazettine. The known alkaloids tazettine, haemanthamine, and the epimer mixture haemanthidine/6-epi-haemanthidine were isolated and identified by spectroscopic methods. Inhibitory cholinesterases activity was not detected. Three forms of propagation were performed: bulb propagation from seed, cut-induced bulb division, and micropropagated bulbs. Finally, different imbibition and post-collection times were evaluated in seed germination assays. The best propagation method was cut-induced bulb division with longitudinal cuts into quarters (T1) while the best conditions for seed germination were 0-day of post-collection and two days of imbibition. The alkaloids analyses of the H. cardenasianus bulbs showed that they are a source of anti-tumoral alkaloids, especially pretazettine (tazettine) and T1 is a sustainable strategy for its propagation and domestication to produce bioactive alkaloids.
33379338/MicroRNA-128 Confers Anti-Endothelial Adhesion and Anti-Migration Properties to Counteract Highly Metastatic Cervical Cancer Cells' Migration in a Parallel-Plate Flow Chamber Despite the distant metastasis of cervical cancer cells being a prominent cause of mortality, neither the metastasis capacity nor the in vitro conditions mimicking adhesion of cervical cancer cells to endothelial cells have been fully elucidated. Circulating metastatic cancer cells undergo transendothelial migration and invade normal organs in distant metastasis; however, the putative molecular mechanism remains largely uncertain. In this study, we describe the use of an in vitro parallel-plate flow chamber to simulate the dynamic circulation stress on cervical cancer cells and elucidate their vascular adhesion and metastasis. We isolate the viable and shear stress-resistant (SSR) cervical cancer cells for mechanistic studies. Remarkably, the identified SSR-HeLa and SSR-CaSki exhibited high in vitro adhesive and metastatic activities. Hence, a consistently suppressed miR-128 level was revealed in SSR cell clones compared to those of parental wild-type (WT) cells. Overexpressed miR-128 attenuated SSR-HeLa cells' adherence to human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs); in contrast, suppressed miR-128 efficiently augmented the static adhesion capacity in WT-HeLa and WT-CaSki cells. Hence, amplified miR-128 modestly abolished in vitro SSR-augmented HeLa and CaSki cell movement, whereas reduced miR-128 aggravated the migration speed in a time-lapse recording assay in WT groups. Consistently, the force expression of miR-128 alleviated the SSR-enhanced HeLa and CaSki cell mobility in a wound healing assay. Notably, miR-128 mediated SSR-enhanced HeLa and CaSki cells' adhesion and metastasis through suppressed ITGA5, ITGB5, sLex, CEACAM-6, MMP9, and MMP23 transcript levels. Our data provide evidence suggesting that miR-128 is a promising microRNA that prevented endothelial cells' adhesion and transendothelial migration to contribute to the SSR-enhanced adhesion and metastasis progression under a parallel-plate flow chamber system. This indicates that the nucleoid-based miR-128 strategy may be an attractive therapeutic strategy to eliminate tumor cells resistant to circulation shear flow, prevent vascular adhesion, and preclude subsequent transendothelial metastasis.
33383672/The Influence of Temperature and Viscosity of Polyethylene Glycol on the Rate of Microwave-Induced In Situ Amorphization of Celecoxib Microwaved-induced in situ amorphization of a drug in a polymer has been suggested to follow a dissolution process, with the drug dissolving into the mobile polymer at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. Thus, based on the Noyes-Whitney and the Stoke-Einstein equations, the temperature and the viscosity are expected to directly impact the rate and degree of drug amorphization. By investigating two different viscosity grades of polyethylene glycol (PEG), i.e., PEG 3000 and PEG 4000, and controlling the temperature of the microwave oven, it was possible to study the influence of both, temperature and viscosity, on the in situ amorphization of the model drug celecoxib (CCX) during exposure to microwave radiation. In this study, compacts containing 30 wt% CCX, 69 wt% PEG 3000 or PEG 4000 and 1 wt% lubricant (magnesium stearate) were exposed to microwave radiation at (i) a target temperature, or (ii) a target viscosity. It was found that at the target temperature, compacts containing PEG 3000 displayed a faster rate of amorphization as compared to compacts containing PEG 4000, due to the lower viscosity of PEG 3000 compared to PEG 4000. Furthermore, at the target viscosity, which was achieved by setting different temperatures for compacts containing PEG 3000 and PEG 4000, respectively, the compacts containing PEG 3000 displayed a slower rate of amorphization, due to a lower target temperature, than compacts containing PEG 4000. In conclusion, with lower viscosity of the polymer, at temperatures above its Tg, and with higher temperatures, both increasing the diffusion coefficient of the drug into the polymer, the rate of amorphization was increased allowing a faster in situ amorphization during exposure to microwave radiation. Hereby, the theory that the microwave-induced in situ amorphization process can be described as a dissolution process of the drug into the polymer, at temperatures above the Tg, is further strengthened.
33383916/Comparative Study of Phosgene Gas Sensing Using Carbon and Boron Nitride Nanomaterials:A DFT Approach Phosgene (COCl2), a valuable industrial compound, maybe a public safety and health risk due to potential abuse and possible accidental spillage. Conventional techniques suffer from issues related to procedural complexity and sensitivity. Therefore, there is a need for the development of simple and highly sensitive techniques that overcome these challenges. Recent advances in nanomaterials science offer the opportunity for the development of such techniques by exploiting the unique properties of these nanostructures. In this study, we investigated the potential of six types of nanomaterials: three carbon-based ([5,0] CNT, C60, C70) and three boron nitride-based (BNNT, BN60, BN70) for the detection of COCl2. The local density approximation (LDA) approach of the density functional theory (DFT) was used to estimate the adsorption characteristics and conductivities of these materials. The results show that the COCl2 molecule adsorbed spontaneously on the Fullerene or nanocages and endothermically on the pristine zigzag nanotubes. Using the magnitude of the bandgap modulation, the order of suitability of the different nanomaterials was established as follows: PBN60 (0.19%) < PC70 (1.39%) < PC60 (1.77%) < PBNNT (27.64%) < PCNT (65.29%) < PBN70 (134.12%). Since the desired criterion for the design of an electronic device is increased conductivity after adsorption due to the resulting low power consumption, PC60 was found to be most suitable because of its power consumption as it had the largest decrease of 1.77% of the bandgap.
33374479/Effect of Iron Source and Medium pH on Growth and Development of Sorbus commixta In Vitro Sorbus commixta is a valuable hardwood plant with a high economical value for its medicinal and ornamental qualities. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of the iron (Fe) source and medium pH on the growth and development of S. commixta in vitro. The Fe sources used, including non-chelated iron sulfate (FeSO4), iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Fe-EDTA), and iron diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Fe-DTPA), were supplemented to the Multipurpose medium with a final Fe concentration of 2.78 mg L-1. The medium without any supplementary Fe was used as the control. The pH of the agar-solidified medium was adjusted to either 4.70, 5.70, or 6.70. The experiment was conducted in a culture room for six weeks with 25  C day and night temperatures, and a 16-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 50 mmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Both the Fe source and pH affected the growth and development of the micropropagated plants in vitro. The leaves were greener in the pH 4.70 and 5.70 treatments. The tissue Fe content decreased with the increase of the medium pH. The leaf chlorophyll content was similar between plants treated with FeSO4 and those with Fe-EDTA. The numbers of the shoots and roots of plantlets treated with FeSO4 were 2.5 and 2 times greater than those of the control, respectively. The fresh and dry weights of the shoot and the root were the greatest for plants treated with Fe-EDTA combined with pH 5.70. The calcium, magnesium, and manganese contents in the plantlets increased in the pH 5.70 treatments regardless of the Fe source. Supplementary Fe decreased the activity of ferric chelate reductase. Overall, although the plantlets absorbed more Fe at pH 4.70, Fe-EDTA combined with pH 5.70 was found to be the best for the growth and development of S. commixta in vitro.
33374300/Interplay between Thyroid Hormones and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 in the Regulation of Lipid Metabolism in the Heart Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, induces the reprogramming of cardiomyocyte metabolism. Thyroid hormones (THs) activate both lipolysis and lipogenesis. Many genes that are involved in lipid metabolism, including Scd1, are regulated by THs. The present study used SCD1 knockout (SCD1-/-) mice to test the hypothesis that THs are important factors that mediate the anti-steatotic effect of SCD1 downregulation in the heart. SCD1 deficiency decreased plasma levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine and the expression of genes that regulate intracellular TH levels (i.e., Slc16a2 and Dio1-3) in cardiomyocytes. Both hypothyroidism and SCD1 deficiency affected genomic and non-genomic TH pathways in the heart. SCD1 deficiency is known to protect mice from genetic- or diet-induced obesity and decrease lipid content in the heart. Interestingly, hypothyroidism increased body adiposity and triglyceride and diacylglycerol levels in the heart in SCD1-/- mice. The accumulation of triglycerides in cardiomyocytes in SCD1-/- hypothyroid mice was caused by the activation of lipogenesis, which likely exceeded the upregulation of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Lipid accumulation was also observed in the heart in wildtype hypothyroid mice compared with wildtype control mice, but this process was related to a reduction of triglyceride lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. We also found that simultaneous SCD1 and deiodinase inhibition increased triglyceride content in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, and this process was related to the downregulation of lipolysis. Altogether, the present results suggest that THs are an important part of the mechanism of SCD1 in cardiac lipid utilization and may be involved in the upregulation of energetic metabolism that is associated with SCD1 deficiency.
33401558/Phytochemical Characterization, In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory, Anti-Diabetic, and Cytotoxic Activities of the Edible Aromatic Plant; Pulicaria jaubertii Pulicaria jaubertii is a medicinal herb that alleviates inflammations and fever. Chromatographic separation, phytochemical characterization, and in vitro biological activities of the plant n-hexane extract were conducted for the first time in this study. Six compounds were isolated for the first time from the n-hexane fraction of Pulicaria jaubertii aerial parts and were identified on the bases of NMR and MS analyses as pseudo-taraxaterol (1), pseudo-taraxasterol acetate (2), 3beta-acetoxytaraxaster-20-en-30-aldehyde (3), calenduladiol-3-O-palmitate (4), stigmasterol (5), and alpha-tocospiro B (6). Compound (6) was a rare tocopherol-related compound and was isolated for the first time from family Asteraceae, while compound (3) was isolated for the first time from genus Pulicaria. The total alcoholic extract and n-hexane fraction were tested for their anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic activities. The n-hexane fraction has dose dependent red blood cells (RBCs) membrane stabilization and inhibition of histamine release activities with IC50: 60.8 and 72.9 microg/mL, respectively. As antidiabetic activity, the alcoholic extract exerted the most inhibition on the activity of yeast alpha-glucosidase, with an IC50: 76.8 microg/mL. The n-hexane fraction showed cytotoxic activity against hepatocarcinoma (HepG-2), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cell lines with IC50: 51.8, 90.8 and 62.2 microg/mL, respectively. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effect of Pulicaria jaubertii might be attributed to the triterpenoid constituents of the n-hexane extract of the plant.
33379373/Pyrrolidinyl Synthetic Cathinones alpha-PHP and 4F-alpha-PVP Metabolite Profiling Using Human Hepatocyte Incubations For more than ten years, new synthetic cathinones (SCs) mimicking the effects of controlled cocaine-like stimulants have flooded the illegal drug market, causing numerous intoxications and fatalities. There are often no data on the pharmacokinetics of these substances when they first emerge onto the market. However, the detection of SC metabolites is often critical in order to prove consumption in clinical and forensic settings. In this research, the metabolite profile of two pyrrolidinyl SCs, alpha-pyrrolidinohexaphenone (alpha-PHP) and 4''-fluoro-alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (4F-alpha-PVP), were characterized to identify optimal intake markers. Experiments were conducted using pooled human hepatocyte incubations followed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry and data-mining software. We suggest alpha-PHP dihydroxy-pyrrolidinyl, alpha-PHP hexanol, alpha-PHP 2'-keto-pyrrolidinyl-hexanol, and alpha-PHP 2'-keto-pyrrolidinyl as markers of alpha-PHP use, and 4F-alpha-PVP dihydroxy-pyrrolidinyl, 4F-alpha-PVP hexanol, 4F-alpha-PVP 2'-keto-pyrrolidinyl-hexanol, and 4F-alpha-PVP 2'-keto-pyrrolidinyl as markers of 4F-alpha-PVP use. These results represent the first data available on 4F-alpha-PVP metabolism. The metabolic fate of alpha-PHP was previously studied using human liver microsomes and urine samples from alpha-PHP users. We identified an additional major metabolite (alpha-PHP dihydroxy-pyrrolidinyl) that might be crucial for documenting exposure to alpha-PHP. Further experiments with suitable analytical standards, which are yet to be synthesized, and authentic specimens should be conducted to confirm these results.
33374285/Hydrogenation of CO2 Promoted by Silicon-Activated H2S: Origin and Implications Unlike the usual method of COx (x = 1, 2) hydrogenation using H2 directly, H2S and HSiSH (silicon-activated H2S) were selected as alternative hydrogen sources in this study for the COx hydrogenation reactions. Our results suggest that it is kinetically infeasible for hydrogen in the form of H2S to transfer to COx at low temperatures. However, when HSiSH is employed instead, the title reaction can be achieved. For this approach, the activation of CO2 is initiated by its interaction with the HSiSH molecule, a reactive species with both a hydridic Hdelta- and protonic Hdelta+. These active hydrogens are responsible for the successive C-end and O-end activations of CO2 and hence the final product (HCOOH). This finding represents a good example of an indirect hydrogen source used in CO2 hydrogenation through reactivity tuned by silicon incorporation, and thus the underlying mechanism will be valuable for the design of similar reactions.
33401723/Copper Complexes as Alternative Redox Mediators in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Thirty years ago, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) emerged as a method for harnessing the sun's energy and converting it into electricity. Since then, a lot of work has been dedicated to improving their global photovoltaic efficiency and their eco-sustainability. Recently, various articles showed the great potential of copper complexes as a convenient and cheap alternative to the traditional ruthenium dyes. In addition, copper complexes demonstrate that they can act as redox mediators for DSSCs, thus being an answer to the problems related to the I3-/I- redox couple. The aim of this review is to report on the most recent impact made by copper complexes as alternative redox mediators. The coverage, mainly from 2016 up to now, is not exhaustive, but allows us to understand the great role played by copper complexes in the design of eco-sustainable DSSCs.
33375373/5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP): Natural Occurrence, Analysis, Biosynthesis, Biotechnology, Physiology and Toxicology L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is both a drug and a natural component of some dietary supplements. 5-HTP is produced from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which is present in two isoforms (TPH1 and TPH2). Decarboxylation of 5-HTP yields serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) that is further transformed to melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). 5-HTP plays a major role both in neurologic and metabolic diseases and its synthesis from tryptophan represents the limiting step in serotonin and melatonin biosynthesis. In this review, after an look at the main natural sources of 5-HTP, the chemical analysis and synthesis, biosynthesis and microbial production of 5-HTP by molecular engineering will be described. The physiological effects of 5-HTP are discussed in both animal studies and human clinical trials. The physiological role of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic, sleep disorders, obesity, myoclonus and serotonin syndrome are also discussed. 5-HTP toxicity and the occurrence of toxic impurities present in tryptophan and 5-HTP preparations are also discussed.
33383880/Phloroglucinol Derivatives from Dryopteris crassirhizoma as Potent Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors Dryopteris crassirhizoma rhizomes are used as a traditional medicine in Asia. The EtOAc extract of these roots has shown potent xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity. However, the main phloroglucinols in D. crassirhizoma rhizomes have not been analyzed. Thus, we investigated the major constituents responsible for this effect. Bioassay-guided purification isolated four compounds: flavaspidic acid AP (1), flavaspidic acid AB (2), flavaspidic acid PB (3), and flavaspidic acid BB (4). Among these, 1 showed the most potent inhibitory activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 6.3 microM, similar to that of allopurinol (IC50 = 5.7 microM) and better than that of oxypurinol (IC50 = 43.1 microM), which are XO inhibitors. A comparative activity screen indicated that the acetyl group at C3 and C3' is crucial for XO inhibition. For example, 1 showed nearly 4-fold higher efficacy than 4 (IC50 = 20.9 microM). Representative inhibitors (1-4) in the rhizomes of D. crassirhizoma showed reversible and noncompetitive inhibition toward XO. Furthermore, the potent inhibitors were shown to be present in high quantities in the rhizomes by a UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. Therefore, the rhizomes of D. crassirhizoma could be used to develop nutraceuticals and medicines for the treatment of gout.
33374169/Two Unconventional Metallothioneins in the Apple Snail Pomacea bridgesii Have Lost Their Metal Specificity during Adaptation to Freshwater Habitats Metallothioneins (MTs) are a diverse group of proteins responsible for the control of metal homeostasis and detoxification. To investigate the impact that environmental conditions might have had on the metal-binding abilities of these proteins, we have characterized the MTs from the apple snail Pomacea bridgesii, a gastropod species belonging to the class of Caenogastropoda with an amphibious lifestyle facing diverse situations of metal bioavailability. P. bridgesii has two structurally divergent MTs, named PbrMT1 and PbrMT2, that are longer than other gastropod MTs due to the presence of extra sequence motifs and metal-binding domains. We have characterized the Zn(II), Cd(II), and Cu(I) binding abilities of these two MTs after their heterologous expression in E. coli. Our results have revealed that despite their structural differences, both MTs share an unspecific metal-binding character, and a great ability to cope with elevated amounts of different metal ions. Our analyses have also revealed slight divergences in their metal-binding features: PbrMT1 shows a more pronounced Zn(II)-thionein character than PbrMT2, while the latter has a stronger Cu(I)-thionein character. The characterization of these two unconventional PbrMTs supports the loss of the metal-binding specificity during the evolution of the MTs of the Ampullariid family, and further suggests an evolutionary link of this loss with the adaptation of these gastropod lineages to metal-poor freshwater habitats.
33383893/Carbon Xerogel Nanostructures with Integrated Bi and Fe Components for Hydrogen Peroxide and Heavy Metal Detection Multifunctional Bi- and Fe-modified carbon xerogel composites (CXBiFe), with different Fe concentrations, were obtained by a resorcinol-formaldehyde sol-gel method, followed by drying in ambient conditions and pyrolysis treatment. The morphological and structural characterization performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning/transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses, indicates the formation of carbon-based nanocomposites with integrated Bi and Fe oxide nanoparticles. At higher Fe concentrations, Bi-Fe-O interactions lead to the formation of hybrid nanostructures and off-stoichiometric Bi2Fe4O9 mullite-like structures together with an excess of iron oxide nanoparticles. To examine the effect of the Fe content on the electrochemical performance of the CXBiFe composites, the obtained powders were initially dispersed in a chitosan solution and applied on the surface of glassy carbon electrodes. Then, the multifunctional character of the CXBiFe systems is assessed by involving the obtained modified electrodes for the detection of different analytes, such as biomarkers (hydrogen peroxide) and heavy metal ions (i.e., Pb2+). The achieved results indicate a drop in the detection limit for H2O2 as Fe content increases. Even though the current results suggest that the surface modifications of the Bi phase with Fe and O impurities lower Pb2+ detection efficiencies, Pb2+ sensing well below the admitted concentrations for drinkable water is also noticed.
33375266/Evidence for Phytoremediation and Phytoexcretion of NTO from Industrial Wastewater by Vetiver Grass The use of insensitive munitions such as 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) is rapidly increasing and is expected to replace conventional munitions in the near future. Various NTO treatment technologies are being developed for the treatment of wastewater from industrial munition facilities. This is the first study to explore the potential phytoremediation of industrial NTO-wastewater using vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides L.). Here, we present evidence that vetiver can effectively remove NTO from wastewater, and also translocated NTO from root to shoot. NTO was phytotoxic and resulted in a loss of plant biomass and chlorophyll. The metabolomic analysis showed significant differences between treated and control samples, with the upregulation of specific pathways such as glycerophosphate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, providing a glimpse into the stress alleviation strategy of vetiver. One of the mechanisms of NTO stress reduction was the excretion of solid crystals. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of NTO crystals in the plant exudates. Further characterization of the exudates is in progress to ascertain the purity of these crystals, and if vetiver could be used for phytomining NTO from industrial wastewater.
33396638/Nephrotoxic Potential of Putative 3,5-Dichloroaniline (3,5-DCA) Metabolites and Biotransformation of 3,5-DCA in Isolated Kidney Cells from Fischer 344 Rats The current study was designed to explore the in vitro nephrotoxic potential of four 3,5-dichloroaniline (3,5-DCA) metabolites (3,5-dichloroacetanilide, 3,5-DCAA; 3,5-dichlorophenylhydroxylamine, 3,5-DCPHA; 2-amino-4,6-dichlorophenol, 2-A-4,6-DCP; 3,5-dichloronitrobenzene, 3,5-DCNB) and to determine the renal metabolism of 3,5-DCA in vitro. In cytotoxicity testing, isolated kidney cells (IKC) from male Fischer 344 rats (~4 million/mL, 3 mL) were exposed to a metabolite (0-1.5 mM; up to 90 min) or vehicle. Of these metabolites, 3,5-DCPHA was the most potent nephrotoxicant, with 3,5-DCNB intermediate in nephrotoxic potential. 2-A-4,6-DCP and 3,5-DCAA were not cytotoxic. In separate experiments, 3,5-DCNB cytotoxicity was reduced by pretreating IKC with antioxidants and cytochrome P450, flavin monooxygenase and peroxidase inhibitors, while 3,5-DCPHA cytotoxicity was attenuated by two nucleophilic antioxidants (glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine). Incubation of IKC with 3,5-DCA (0.5-1.0 mM, 90 min) produced only 3,5-DCAA and 3,5-DCNB as detectable metabolites. These data suggest that 3,5-DCNB and 3,5-DCPHA are potential nephrotoxic metabolites and may contribute to 3,5-DCA induced nephrotoxicity in vivo. In addition, the kidney can bioactivate 3,5-DCNB to toxic metabolites, and 3,5-DCPHA appears to generate reactive metabolites to contribute to 3,5-DCA nephrotoxicity. In vitro, N-oxidation of 3,5-DCA appears to be the primary mechanism of bioactivation of 3,5-DCA to nephrotoxic metabolites.
33383775/Application of Natural Clinoptilolite for Ammonium Removal from Sludge Water Sludge water (SW) arising from the dewatering of anaerobic digested sludge causes high back loads of ammonium, leading to high stress (inhibition of the activity of microorganisms by an oversupply of nitrogen compounds (substrate inhibition)) for wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the other hand, ammonium is a valuable resource to substitute ammonia from the energy intensive Haber-Bosch process for fertilizer production. Within this work, it was investigated to what extent and under which conditions Carpathian clinoptilolite powder (CCP 20) can be used to remove ammonium from SW and to recover it. Two different SW, originating from municipal WWTPs were investigated (SW1: c0 = 967 mg/L NH4-N, municipal wastewater; SW2: c0 = 718-927 mg/L NH4-N, large industrial wastewater share). The highest loading was achieved at 307 K with 16.1 mg/g (SW1) and 15.3 mg/g (SW2) at 295 K. Kinetic studies with different specific dosages (0.05 gCLI/mgNH4-N), temperatures (283-307 K) and pre-loaded CCP 20 (0-11.4 mg/g) were conducted. At a higher temperature a higher load was achieved. Already after 30 min contact time, regardless of the sludge water, a high load up to 7.15 mg/g at 307 K was reached, achieving equilibrium after 120 min. Pre-loaded sorbent could be further loaded with ammonium when it was recontacted with the SW.
33374392/Tuning G-Quadruplex Nanostructures with Lipids. Towards Designing Hybrid Scaffolds for Oligonucleotide Delivery   Two G-quadruplex forming oligonucleotides [d(TG4T)4 and d(TG6T)4] were selected as two tetramolecular quadruplex nanostructures because of their demonstrated ability to be modified with hydrophobic molecules. This allowed us to synthesize two series of G-quadruplex conjugates that differed in the number of G-tetrads, as well as in the terminal position of the lipid modification. Both solution and solid-phase syntheses were carried out to yield the corresponding lipid oligonucleotide conjugates modified at their 3'- and 5'-termini, respectively. Biophysical studies confirmed that the presence of saturated alkyl chains with different lengths did not affect the G-quadruplex integrity, but increased the stability. Next, the G-quadruplex domain was added to an 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide. Gene silencing studies confirmed the ability of such G-rich oligonucleotides to facilitate the inhibition of target Renilla luciferase without showing signs of toxicity in tumor cell lines.
33396838/Ballistic Impact Behaviour of Glass/Epoxy Composite Laminates Embedded with Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Wires This paper aims to estimate the enhancement in the energy absorption characteristics of the glass fiber reinforced composites (GFRP) by embedding prestrained pseudo-elastic shape memory alloy (SMA) that was used as a secondary reinforcement. The pseudo-elastic SMA (PE-SMA) embedded were in the form of wires and have an equiatomic composition (i.e., 50%-50%) of nickel (Ni) and titanium (Ti). These specimens are fabricated using a vacuum-assisted resin infusion process. The estimation is done for the GFRP and SMA/GFRP specimens at four different impact velocities (65, 75, 85, and 103 m/s) using a gas-gun impact set-up. At all different impact velocities, the failure modes change as we switch from GFRP to SMA/GFRP specimen. In the SMA/GFRP specimen, the failure mode changed from delamination in the primary region to SMA-pull out and SMA deformation. This leads to an increase in the ballistic limit. It is observed that energy absorbed by SMA/GFRP specimens is higher than the GFRP specimens subjected to the same levels of impact energy. To understand the damping capabilities of SMA embedment, vibration signals are captured, and the damping ratio is calculated. SMA dampens the vibrations imparted by the projectile to the specimen. The damping ratio of the SMA/GFRP specimens is higher than the GFRP specimens. The damping effect is more prominent below the ballistic limit when the projectile got rebounded (65 m/s).
33375458/Health Benefits and Chemical Composition of Matcha Green Tea: A Review Japanese matcha is a type of powdered green tea, grown in a traditional way. Shading of the plants during the growth period enhances the processes of synthesis and accumulation of biologically active compounds, including theanine, caffeine, chlorophyll and various types of catechins. Green tea contains four main catechins, i.e., (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), of which the latter is the most active and abundant and matcha is their best condensed source. Due to its unique chemical composition and prized flavour, which sets it apart from other tea beverages, it is considered the highest quality tea. Its health-promoting properties are attributed to the high content of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances. Studies confirming the high antioxidant potential of tea beverages claim that it originates from the considerable content of catechins, a type of phenolic compound with beneficial effects on human health. Due to its potential for preventing many diseases and supporting cognitive function, regular consumption of matcha may have a positive effect on both physical and mental health. The aim of this review was to compile the health benefits of matcha tea. It is the first such review to be undertaken, and presents its main bioactive compounds in a systematic manner.
33375454/Ocimum campechianum Mill. from Amazonian Ecuador: Chemical Composition and Biological Activities of Extracts and Their Main Constituents (Eugenol and Rosmarinic Acid) The essential oil (EO), the methanolic (MeOH), and the 70% ethanolic (70% EtOH) extracts obtained from the aerial parts of Ocimum campechianum Mill. (Ecuador) were chemically characterized through gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array-mass spectrometry detectors (HPLC-DAD-MS) and studied for their in vitro biological activity. The radical scavenger activity, performed by spectrophotometric 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays, highlighted significant IC50 values for the EO, extracts and their main constituents (eugenol and rosmarinic acid). EO (and eugenol) showed noteworthy activity against Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and a moderate effect against clinical Candida strains, with possible synergism in association to fluconazole against the latter microorganisms. The extracts and pure molecules exhibited weak cytotoxic activity against the HaCat cell line and no mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains, giving indication of safety. Instead, EO showed a weak activity against adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549). The above-mentioned evidence leads us to suggest a potential use of the crude drug, extracts, and EO in cosmetic formulation and food supplements as antioxidant agents. In addition, EO may also have a possible application in plant protection and anti-Candida formulations.
33375233/Chemical Evaluation of Eumelanin Maturation by ToF-SIMS and Alkaline Peroxide Oxidation HPLC Analysis Residual melanins have been detected in multimillion-year-old animal body fossils; however, confident identification and characterization of these natural pigments remain challenging due to loss of chemical signatures during diagenesis. Here, we simulate this post-burial process through artificial maturation experiments using three synthetic and one natural eumelanin exposed to mild (100  C/100 bar) and harsh (250  C/200 bar) environmental conditions, followed by chemical analysis employing alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation (AHPO) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Our results show that AHPO is sensitive to changes in the melanin molecular structure already during mild heat and pressure treatment (resulting, e.g., in increased C-C cross-linking), whereas harsh maturation leads to extensive loss of eumelanin-specific chemical markers. In contrast, negative-ion ToF-SIMS spectra are considerably less affected by mild maturation conditions, and eumelanin-specific features remain even after harsh treatment. Detailed analysis of ToF-SIMS spectra acquired prior to experimental treatment revealed significant differences between the investigated eumelanins. However, systematic spectral changes upon maturation reduced these dissimilarities, indicating that intense heat and pressure treatment leads to the formation of a common, partially degraded, eumelanin molecular structure. Our findings elucidate the complementary nature of AHPO and ToF-SIMS during chemical characterization of eumelanin traces in fossilized organismal remains.
33401526/Fe(II) Spin Crossover/Polymer Hybrid Materials: Investigation of the SCO Behavior via Temperature-Dependent Raman Spectroscopy, Physicochemical Characterization and Migration Release Study Polymeric composites constitute an appealing class of materials with applications in various fields. Spin crossover (SCO) coordination complexes are switchable materials with potential use in data storage and sensors. Their incorporation into polymers can be considered an effective method for their wider practical application. In this study, Fe(II) SCO/polylactic acid hybrid polymeric composites have been prepared by film casting. The mononuclear coordination complex [Fe{N(CN)2}2(abpt)2] was incorporated into polylactic acid. The morphological, structural and thermoanalytical characterization of the composite films were performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total reflectance (ATR/FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In addition, the migration release study (MRS) of the SCO compound from the polymeric matrix into the food simulant 50% v/v water/ethanol solution was also examined via UV/Vis absorption. Of particular interest was the investigation of the SCO behavior of the coordination complex after its incorporation into the polymer matrix; it was accomplished by temperature-dependent micro-Raman spectroscopy. The described attempt could be considered a preparatory step toward the development of SCO-based temperature sensors integrated into food packaging materials.
33422097/Propofol suppresses microglial phagocytosis through the downregulation of MFG-E8 Background Microglia are highly motile phagocytic cells in the healthy brain with surveillance and clearance functions. Although microglia have been shown to engulf cellular debris following brain insult, less is known about their phagocytic function in the absence of injury. Propofol can inhibit microglial activity, including phagocytosis. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8), as a regulator of microglia, plays an essential role in the phagocytic process. However, whether MFG-E8 affects the alteration of phagocytosis by propofol remains unknown. Methods Microglial BV2 cells were treated with propofol, with or without MFG-E8. Phagocytosis of latex beads was evaluated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. MFG-E8, p-AMPK, AMPK, p-Src, and Src levels were assessed by western blot analysis. Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) and dasatinib (Src inhibitor) were applied to determine the roles of AMPK and Src in microglial phagocytosis under propofol treatment. Results The phagocytic ability of microglia was significantly decreased after propofol treatment for 4 h (P < 0.05). MFG-E8 production was inhibited by propofol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Preadministration of MFG-E8 dose-dependently (from 10 to 100 ng/ml) reversed the suppression of phagocytosis by propofol (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the decline in p-AMPK and p-Src levels induced by propofol intervention was reversed by MFG-E8 activation (P < 0.05). Administration of compound C (AMPK inhibitor) and dasatinib (Src inhibitor) to microglia blocked the trend of enhanced phagocytosis induced by MFG-E8 (P < 0.05). Conclusions These findings reveal the intermediate role of MFG-E8 between propofol and microglial phagocytic activity. Moreover, MFG-E8 may reverse the suppression of phagocytosis induced by propofol through the regulation of the AMPK and Src signaling pathways.
33422075/Quantitative proteomic analysis to reveal expression differences for butanol production from glycerol and glucose by Clostridium sp. strain CT7  Clostridium sp. strain CT7 is a new emerging microbial cell factory with high butanol production ratio owing to its non-traditional butanol fermentation mode with uncoupled acetone and 1,3-propanediol formation. Significant changes of metabolic products profile were shown in glycerol- and glucose-fed strain CT7, especially higher butanol and lower volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production occurred from glycerol-fed one. However, the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon was still unclear. To better elaborate the bacterial response towards glycerol and glucose, the quantitative proteomic analysis through iTRAQ strategy was performed to reveal the regulated proteomic expression levels under different substrates. Proteomics data showed that proteomic expression levels related with carbon metabolism and solvent generation under glycerol media were highly increased. In addition, the up-regulation of hydrogenases, ferredoxins and electron-transferring proteins may attribute to the internal redox balance, while the earlier triggered sporulation response in glycerol-fed media may be associated with the higher butanol production. This study will pave the way for metabolic engineering of other industrial microorganisms to obtain efficient butanol production from glycerol.
33422055/Highly selective synthesis of d-amino acids via stereoinversion of corresponding counterpart by an in vivo cascade cell factory Background d-Amino acids are increasingly used as building blocks to produce pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, establishing a universal biocatalyst for the general synthesis of d-amino acids from cheap and readily available precursors with few by-products is challenging. In this study, we developed an efficient in vivo biocatalysis system for the synthesis of d-amino acids from l-amino acids by the co-expression of membrane-associated l-amino acid deaminase obtained from Proteus mirabilis (LAAD), meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenases obtained from Symbiobacterium thermophilum (DAPDH), and formate dehydrogenase obtained from Burkholderia stabilis (FDH), in recombinant Escherichia coli. Results To generate the in vivo cascade system, three strategies were evaluated to regulate enzyme expression levels, including single-plasmid co-expression, double-plasmid co-expression, and double-plasmid MBP-fused co-expression. The double-plasmid MBP-fused co-expression strain Escherichia coli pET-21b-MBP-laad/pET-28a-dapdh-fdh, exhibiting high catalytic efficiency, was selected. Under optimal conditions, 75 mg/mL of E. coli pET-21b-MBP-laad/pET-28a-dapdh-fdh whole-cell biocatalyst asymmetrically catalyzed the stereoinversion of 150 mM l-Phe to d-Phe, with quantitative yields of over 99% ee in 24 h, by the addition of 15 mM NADP+ and 300 mM ammonium formate. In addition, the whole-cell biocatalyst was used to successfully stereoinvert a variety of aromatic and aliphatic l-amino acids to their corresponding d-amino acids. Conclusions The newly constructed in vivo cascade biocatalysis system was effective for the highly selective synthesis of d-amino acids via stereoinversion.
33379365/Essential (Mg, Fe, Zn and Cu) and Non-Essential (Cd and Pb) Elements in Predatory Insects (Vespa crabro and Vespa velutina): A Molecular Perspective The recent introduction of the Asian yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, into Europe has raised concern regarding the threat to honeybees and the competition with the European hornet, Vespa crabro. The aim of this study was to investigated essential (Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) elements in these two species. Element concentrations were determined in the whole body and separately in the head, thorax and abdomen using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The changes in essential element concentration and speciation during metamorphosis were also studied using size exclusion chromatography followed by AAS and proteomic analysis. In both species, the essential elements were more concentrated in the abdomen due to the presence of fat bodies. Magnesium, Fe and Zn concentrations were significantly higher in V. crabro than in V. velutina and could have been related to the higher aerobic energy demand of the former species required to sustain foraging flight. Low concentrations of Cd and Pb were indicative of low environmental exposure. The concentration and speciation of essential elements, particularly Fe, varied among the developmental stages, indicating a modification of ligand preferences during metamorphosis. Overall, the results in the present study provide a better understanding of the hornet metal metabolism and a foundation for additional studies.
33428685/Effect of ethanol in carbon monoxide poisoning and delayed neurologic sequelae: A prospective observational study Objectives Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most common poisoning substances, which causes mortality and morbidity worldwide. Delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS) have been reported to occur from several days to months after exposure to CO. Thus, there is a need for prevention, recognition, and treatment of DNS. Patients with CO poisoning as a component of intentional suicide often also consume ethanol, but there is debate regarding its role in DNS. We explored whether ethanol has a neuroprotective effect in CO poisoning. Methods This prospective observational study included patients who visited the emergency department from August 2016 to August 2019 due to CO poisoning. After treatment of acute CO poisoning, patients were interviewed by telephone to ascertain whether DNS had occurred within 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months from the time of CO exposure. Results During the study period, 171 patients were enrolled. 28 patients (16.37%) developed DNS. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were 15 (10.5-15) for the non-DNS group and 10 (7-15) for the DNS group (p = 0.002). The ethanol levels were 11.01 +- 17.58 mg/dL and 1.49 +- 2.63 mg/dL for each group (p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the GCS score had an odds ratio of 0.770 (p < 0.001) and the ethanol level had 0.882 (p < 0.030) for onset of DNS. Conclusions Higher ethanol level and higher initial GCS score were associated with lower incidence of DNS. Ethanol could have a neuroprotective effect on the occurrence of DNS in CO poisoning patients.
33399496/Comparison of the antioxidant activities of nonfumigated and sulphur-fumigated Chrysanthemum morifolium cv. Hang-ju induced by oxidative stress Abstract Context  The traditional drying method, sun drying, for Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. cv. Hang-ju (Compositae) (HJ) is widely replaced by sulphur fumigation (SF), which has an unknown effect on its efficacy. Objective  To investigate protective effects of nonfumigated HJ (NHJ) and sulphur-fumigated HJ (SHJ) water extracts against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Materials and methods  Sprague-Dawley rats were administered high-fat diet to induce hyperlipidaemia and randomly divided into eight groups (n = 6): control, fenofibrate, NHJ and SHJ extracts (1, 2 or 4 g crude drugs/kg/d; intragastric administration for 8 weeks). Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with NHJ and SHJ extracts (50, 100 or 200 mug/mL) for 24 h, followed by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 20 mug/mL) for 2 h in vitro. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), SOD and MDA levels and apoptosis were evaluated. Results  NHJ was more effective than SHJ in decreasing serum TG, TC, LDL-C, LDL/HDL and MDA while increasing serum HDL-C and SOD levels at high doses. SHJ (IC50=19.9 mg/mL) suppressed HUVEC growth stronger than NHJ (IC50=186.7 mg/mL). At 200 mug/mL, NHJ was more effective than SHJ in downregulating ROS and MDA levels, reducing HUVECs apoptosis rate and elevating SOD activity in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Conclusions  SF causes oxidative damage and attenuates antioxidative activity in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs, which promotes lipid peroxidation. SF is not recommended for processing HJ.
33488942/The Effects of Dandelion Polysaccharides on Iron Metabolism by Regulating Hepcidin via JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway Recent studies have claimed that iron overload was correlated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and our previous studies have also demonstrated that dandelion polysaccharide (DP) suppressed HCC cell line proliferation via causing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, but the effect of DP on metabolism is still not very clear. Here, we aim to clarify the effects of DP on iron metabolism and the underlying mechanism. In this study, we found that DP could reduce iron burden in hepatoma cells and grafted tumors. Hepcidin is a central regulator in iron metabolism. We confirmed that the expression of hepcidin in HCC tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the adjacent nontumor tissues. The expression of hepcidin was downregulated in the liver of mouse model treatment with DP, as well as in hepatoma cells. Moreover, RNA sequencing and western blot data revealed that DP inhibited the IL-6-activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In summary, our results revealed that DP might be a new potential drug candidate for the regulation of iron burden and the treatment of HCC.
33404277/Design, synthesis and evaluation of carbazole derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents Abstract Five series of novel carbazole derivatives containing an aminoguanidine, dihydrotriazine, thiosemicarbazide, semicarbazide or isonicotinic moiety were designed, synthesised and evaluated for their antimicrobial activities. Most of the compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activities towards different bacterial strains (including one multidrug-resistant clinical isolate) and one fungal strain with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) between 0.5 and 16 microg/ml. Compounds 8f and 9d showed the most potent inhibitory activities (MICs of 0.5-2 microg/ml). Furthermore, compounds 8b, 8d, 8f, 8k, 9b and 9e with antimicrobial activities were not cytotoxic to human gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901 and AGS) or a normal human liver cell line (L-02). Structure-activity relationship analyses and docking studies implicated the dihydrotriazine group in increasing the antimicrobial potency and reducing the toxicity of the carbazole compounds. In vitro enzyme activity assays suggested that compound 8f binding to dihydrofolate reductase might account for the antimicrobial effect.
33488944/Toxic Prediction of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids and Structure-Dependent Induction of Apoptosis in HepaRG Cells Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are common phytotoxins and could cause liver genotoxicity/carcinogenicity following metabolic activation. However, the toxicity of different structures remains unclear due to the wide variety of PAs. In this study, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of 40 PAs were analyzed, and their toxicity was predicted by Komputer Assisted Technology (TOPKAT) using Discovery Studio software. The in silico results showed that all PAs except retronecine had good intestinal absorption, and all PAs were predicted to have different toxicity ranges. To verify the predictive results, 4 PAs were selected to investigate cell injury and possible mechanisms of the differentiation in HepaRG cells, including retronecine type of twelve-membered cyclic diester (retrorsine), eleven-membered cyclic diester (monocrotaline), noncyclic diester (retronecine), and platynecine type (platyphylline). After 24 h exposure, retronecine-type PAs exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity. The high-content screening assay showed that cell oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the concentration of calcium ions increased, and neutral lipid metabolism was changed notably in HepaRG cells. Induced apoptosis by PAs was indicated by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. Overall, our study revealed structure-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis after PA exposure, suggesting that the prediction results of in silico have certain reference values for compound toxicity. A 1,2-membered cyclic diester seems to be a more potent apoptosis inducer than other PAs.
33406941/Development of novel isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids with potent activity against susceptible/resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and bronchitis causing-bacteria Abstract Joining the global fight against Tuberculosis, the world's most deadly infectious disease, herein we present the design and synthesis of novel isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids (5a-m and 9a-c) as promising anti-tubercular and antibacterial agents. The anti-tubercular activity of the target hybrids was evaluated against drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis strain (ATCC 27294) where hybrids 5d, 5g and 5h were found to be as potent as INH with MIC = 0.24 microg/mL, also the activity was evaluated against Isoniazid/Streptomycin resistant M. tuberculosis (ATCC 35823) where compounds 5g and 5h showed excellent activity (MIC = 3.9 microg/mL). Moreover, the target hybrids were examined against six bronchitis causing-bacteria. Most derivatives exhibited excellent antibacterial activity. K. pneumonia emerged as the most sensitive strain with MIC range: 0.49-7.81 microg/mL. Furthermore, a molecular docking study has proposed DprE1 as a probable enzymatic target for herein reported isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids, and explored the binding interactions within the vicinity of DprE1 active site. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
33404264/Preclinical in vitro screening of newly synthesised amidino substituted benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles Abstract Newly synthesised benzimidazole/benzotiazole derivatives bearing amidino, namely 3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-1-ium chloride, substituents have been evaluated for their potential antitumor activity in vitro. Compounds and standard drugs (doxorubicin, staurosporine and vandetanib) were tested on three human lung cancer cell lines A549, HCC827 and NCI-H358. We tested compounds in MTS citotoxicity assay and in BrdU proliferative assay performed on 2 D and 3 D assay format. Because benzmidazole scaffold is similar to natural purines, we tested the most active compounds for ability to induce cell apoptosis of A549 by binding to DNA in comparison with doxorubicin and saturosporine. Additionally, the ADME properties of the most active benzothiazole/benzimidazole and non-active compounds were determined to see if the different ADME properties are the cause of different activity in 2 D and 3 D assays, as well as to see if the tested active compounds have drug like properties and potency for further profilation. ADME characterisation included solubility, lipophilicity, permeability, metabolic stability and binding to plasma proteins. In general, the benzothiazole derivatives were more active in comparison to their benzimidazole analogues. The exception was 2-phenyl substituted benzimidazole 6a being active with very pronounced activity especially towards HCC827 cells. All active compounds have similar mode of action on A549 cell line as standard compound doxorubicin, which binds to nucleic acids with the DNA double helix. Tested active benzothiazole compounds were characterised by moderate to good solubility, good metabolic stability, low permeability and high binding to plasma proteins. One tested active benzimidazole derivative showed ADME properties, but lower lipophilicity resulted in low PPB and higher metabolic instability. In addition, no significant difference was observed in ADME profile between active and non-active compounds. Graphical Abstract
33403918/Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induces caspase-independent cell death, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in human cervical cancer HeLa cells Abstract Context Bufadienolide compounds occur in many plants and animal species and have strong cardiac and anti-inflammatory properties. The compounds have been recently investigated for cytotoxic and antitumor activity. Objective The cytotoxic effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate - a bufadienolide steroid occuring in plants from Kalanchoe genus (Crassulaceae), was evaluated with cervical cancer HeLa cells in vitro. Materials and methods The cytotoxic activity of the compound (at 0.1-20.0 mug/mL) on the cells was determined by Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) system for 24 h. The estimation of cell cycle arrest, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and caspases-3/7/9 activity in the HeLa cells treated with the compound was done by flow cytometry and luminometric technique. DNA damage in the cells was estimated by immunofluorescence staining and the comet assay with etoposide as a positive control. Results The compound had strong effect on the cells (IC50 = 0.55 mug/mL) by the suppression of HeLa cells proliferation in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induction of cell death through double-stranded DNA damage and reactive oxygen species overproduction. Furthermore, we did not observe an increase in the activity of caspase-3/7/9 in the treated cells as well as a decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential. Gene expression analysis revealed the overexpression of NF-Kappa-B inhibitors genes (>2-fold higher than control) in the treated cells. Conclusions Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induces cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent cell death through double-stranded DNA damage. These results are an important step in further studies on cell death signalling pathways induced by bufadienolides.
33435939/Salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis in status asthmaticus survivor Background Salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis is a rare presentation that could manifest in specific clinical context as acute asthmatic attack treatment. An increase of glycolysis pathway leading to pyruvate escalation is the mechanism of hyperlactatemia in beta2-adrenergic agonist drug. Case presentation A 40-year-old man who had poor-controlled asthma, presented with progressive dyspnea with coryza symptom for 6 days. He was intubated and admitted into medical intensive care unit due to deteriorated respiratory symptom. Severe asthmatic attack was diagnosed and approximate 1.5 canisters of salbutamol inhaler was administrated within 24 h of admission. Initial severe acidosis consisted of acute respiratory acidosis from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and acute metabolic acidosis resulting from bronchospasm and hypoxia-related lactic acidosis, respectively. The lactate level was normalized in 6 h after hypoxemia and ventilation correction. Given the lactate level re-elevated into a peak of 4.6 mmol/L without signs of tissue hypoxia nor other possible etiologies, the salbutamol toxicity was suspected and the inhaler was discontinued that contributed to rapid lactate clearance. The patient was safely discharged on the 6th day of admission. Conclusion The re-elevation of serum lactate in status asthmaticus patient who had been administrated with the vast amount of beta2-adrenergic agonist should be considered for salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis and promptly discontinued especially when there were no common potentials.
33430871/Lactate as a metabolite from probiotic Lactobacilli mitigates ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury: an in vivo study Background Pre-administration of probiotic Lactobacilli attenuates ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury (GMI). The underpinning mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We speculated that lactate, the main metabolite of Lactobacillus that can be safely used as a common food additive, mediated the gastroprotective effect. This study aimed to gain experimental evidence to support our hypothesis and to shed lights on its underlying mechanisms. Methods Lactate was orally administrated to mice at different doses 30 min prior to the induction of GMI. Gastric tissue samples were collected and underwent histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analyses. Results Pretreatment with lactate at 1-3 g/kg significantly curtailed the severity of ethanol-induced GMI, as shown by morphological and histopathological examinations of gastric tissue samples. Significantly lower level of cytokines indicative of local inflammation were found in mice receiving lactate treatment prior to ethanol administration. Western-blot, immunohistochemical analysis and qPCR suggested that gastroprotective properties of lactate were mediated by its modulatory effects on the expression of the apoptosis regulator gene Bax, the apoptotic executive protein gene Casp3, and genes critical for gastric mucosal integrity, including those encoding tight junction proteins Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-5, and that for lactate receptor GPR81. Conclusion Lactate mitigates ethanol-induced GMI by curtailing local gastric inflammatory response, down-regulating the expression of the apoptosis regulator and executor genes Bax and Casp3, and up-regulating the expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins Occludin, Claudin-1, and Claudin-5 and the lactate receptor GPR81.

33430874/Molecular, structural and biochemical characterization of a novel recombinant chlorophyllase from cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata PCC 6304 Background  Chlorophyllase catalyzes the hydrolysis of chlorophyll and produces chlorophyllide and phytol. Cyanobacterial chlorophyllases are likely to be more highly heterologously expressed than plant chlorophyllases. A novel recombinant chlorophyllase from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata PCC 6304 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Results The putative N-terminal 28-amino-acid signal peptide sequence of O. acuminata chlorophyllase (OaCLH) is essential for its activity, but may confer poor solubility on OaCLH. The C-terminal fusion of a 6 x His tag caused a partial loss of activity in recombinant OaCLH, but an N-terminal 6 x His tag did not destroy its activity. The optimal pH and temperature for recombinant OaCLH activity are 7.0 and 40  C, respectively. Recombinant OaCLH has hydrolysis activities against chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, bacteriochlorophyll a, and pheophytin a, but prefers chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a as substrates. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that the catalytic triad of OaCLH consists of Ser159, Asp226, and His258. Conclusions The high-level expression and broad substrate specificity of recombinant OaCLH make it suitable for genetically engineering and a promising biocatalyst for industrial production, with applications in vegetable oil refining and laundry detergents.
33435968/Alkaloid and benzopyran compounds of Melicope latifolia fruit exhibit anti-hepatitis C virus activities Background New agents for developing alternative or complementary medicine to treat the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still needed due to high rates of HCV infection globally and the current limitations of available treatments. Treatment of HCV with a combination of direct acting antivirals have been shown to be approximately 90% effective but will be limited in the future due to the emergence of drug resistance and high cost. The leaves of Melicope latifolia have previously been reported to have anti-HCV activity and are a potential source of bioactive compounds for future novel drug development. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the extract of M. latifolia fruit to treat HCV and to isolate its active compounds. Method M. latifolia fruit was extracted using methanol and purified using vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) and Radial Chromatography. The anti-HCV activity was analyzed using cell culture lines Huh7it-1 and JFH1 (genotype 2a). Time-of-addition and immunoblotting studies were performed to identify the mode of action of the isolated active compounds. The structures of the active compounds were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, UV, IR, and Mass Spectra. Results Six known compounds were isolated from M. latifolia fruit: O-methyloktadrenolon, alloevodionol, isopimpinellin, alloxanthoxyletin, methylevodionol, and N-methylflindersine. N-methylflidersine was the most active compound with IC50 value of 3.8 mug/ml while methylevodionol, isopimpinellin, and alloevodionol were less active. O-methyloktadrenolon and alloxanthoxyletin were moderately active with IC50 values of 10.9 and 21.72 mug/ml, respectively. N-methylflidersine decreased level of HCV NS3 protein expression in the cells. Conclusion The alkaloid compound, N-methylflindersine which was isolated from M. latifolia possesses anti-HCV activity through post-entry inhibition and suppressed NS3 protein expression.
33436015/Empagliflozin protects against atherosclerosis progression by modulating lipid profiles and sympathetic activity Background Several large clinical trials have confirmed the cardioprotective role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, whether empagliflozin, as an SGLT2i, could alleviate atherosclerosis progression in non-diabetic states remain unknown. Methods ApoE-/- mice were fed a Western diet for 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis. On the 7th week, a group of mice were treated with drinking water containing empagliflozin (10 mg/kg/day), while another group was given normal water. At the 12th week, the whole aortas of each group were harvested. Oil Red O, HE and Movat staining were performed for atherosclerotic lesion area and size. Mouse serum lipid profiles (total cholesterol [TC], triglyceride [TG], low-density lipoprotein-c [LDL], and high-density lipoprotein-c [HDL]), systemic inflammation levels (IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components and sympathetic activity (norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y) indicators were measured by ELISA. Results Empagliflozin reduced the atherosclerotic lesion burden (-8.6 %, P = 0.004) at aortic root in ApoE-/- mice. In addition, empagliflozin decreased body weight (-3.27 g, P = 0.002), lipid profiles (TC: [-15.3 mmol/L, P = 0.011]; TG: [-2.4 mmol/L, P < 0.001]; LDL: [-2.9 mmol/L, P = 0.010]), RAAS (renin [-9.3 ng/L, P = 0.047]; aldosterone [-16.7 ng/L, P < 0.001]) and sympathetic activity (norepinephrine [-8.9 ng/L, P = 0.019]; neuropeptide Y [-8.8 ng/L, P = 0.002]). However, the anti-inflammatory effect of empagliflozin was not significantly evident. Conclusions The early atherosclerotic lesion size was less visible in empagliflozin-treated mice. Empagliflozin could decrease lipid profiles and sympathetic activity in atherosclerosis.
33430854/Antitumor effect and molecular mechanism of fucoidan in NSCLC Background Fucoidan, a water-soluble polysaccharide, exerts anticoagulant and antiviral functions. It was recently reported that fucoidan also exerts an antitumor function. Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tumor,apoptosis and anti-metastasis effects of fucoidan in both cell-based assays and mouse xenograft model, as well as to clarify possible role of m-TOR pathway in the protection. Methods In vitro: Different concentrations of fucoidan were given to act on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 and H1650. The effects of fucoidan on cell proliferation were observed by detecting cyclin expression levels, CCK8 and EDU experiments and cloning experiments. The apoptotic level was detected by flow cytometry and the apoptotic protein level was detected by Westernblot. By detecting the expression of adhesion molecules, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, and Transwell cell invasion and migration experiment, the effect of fucoidan on cell adhesion, invasion and migration was observed. Meanwhile the effect of fucoidan on angiogenesis was observed by detecting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In vivo experiment: An animal model of NSCLC cell mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumor was established to analyze the correlation between the consumption of fucoidan and the size and volume of xenograft tumor through gross observation. Through immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence double staining, ki67 and cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and CD31) and VEGF-A in the tumor were detected, and the correlation between the amount of fucoidan and the above indexes was analyzed. Results Fucoidan inhibited the proliferation and angiogenesis of NSCLC cells via the mTOR pathway and promoted their apoptosis by increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Not only that, fucoidan inhibited NSCLC cell invasion via epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). The mice fed fucoidan exhibited significant reductions in tumor volumes and weights. These indicators (Ki67, VEGF-A,N-cadherin) were decreased and E-cadherin expression was up-regulated in A549 mice that treated with fucoidan. The results showed that fucoidan inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo by affecting the expression of related proteins. Conclusion Fucoidan conveys antitumor effects and our results represent an ideal therapeutic agent for NSCLC.

33488930/Preparation, Biosafety, and Cytotoxicity Studies of a Newly Tumor-Microenvironment-Responsive Biodegradable Mesoporous Silica Nanosystem Based on Multimodal and Synergistic Treatment Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) often suffer relapse, and clinical improvements offered by radiotherapy and chemotherapy are modest. Although targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been a topic of significant research in recent years, scientific developments have not yet translated to significant improvements for patients with TNBC. In view of these current clinical treatment shortcomings, we designed a silica nanosystem (SNS) with Nano-Ag as the core and a complex of MnO2 and doxorubicin (Dox) as the surrounding mesoporous silica shell. This system was coated with anti-PD-L1 to target the PD-L1 receptor, which is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells. MnO2 itself has been shown to act as chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and Dox is cytotoxic. Thus, the full SNS system presents a multimodal, potentially synergistic strategy for the treatment of TNBC. Given potential interest in the clinical translation of SNS, the biological safety and antitumor activity of SNS were evaluated in a series of studies that included physicochemical characterization, particle stability, blood compatibility, and cytotoxicity. We found that the particle size and zeta potential of SNS were 94.6 nm and -22.1 mV, respectively. Ultraviolet spectrum analysis showed that Nano-Ag, Dox, and MnO2 were successfully loaded into SNS, and the drug loading ratio of Dox was about 10.2%. Stability studies found that the particle size of SNS did not change in different solutions. Hemolysis tests showed that SNS, at levels far exceeding the anticipated physiologic concentrations, did not induce red blood cell lysis. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments found that SNS did not activate platelets or cause coagulopathy and had no significant effects on the total number of blood cells or hepatorenal function. Cytotoxicity experiments suggested that SNS significantly inhibited the growth of tumor cells by damaging cell membranes, increasing intracellular ROS levels, inhibiting the release of TGF-beta1 cytokines by macrophages, and inhibiting intracellular protein synthesis. In general, SNS appeared to have favorable biosafety and antitumor effects and may represent an attractive new therapeutic approach for the treatment of TNBC.
33488943/A Marine Terpenoid, Heteronemin, Induces Both the Apoptosis and Ferroptosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells and Involves the ROS and MAPK Pathways Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of death, resulting in over 700 thousand deaths annually worldwide. Chemotherapy is the primary therapeutic strategy for patients with late-stage HCC. Heteronemin is a marine natural product isolated from Hippospongia sp. that has been found to protect against carcinogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, heteronemin was found to inhibit the proliferation of the HCC cell lines HA22T and HA59T and induce apoptosis via the caspase pathway. Heteronemin treatment also induced the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are associated with heteronemin-induced cell death, and to trigger ROS removal by mitochondrial SOD2 rather than cytosolic SOD1. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was associated with ROS-induced cell death, and heteronemin downregulated the expression of ERK, a MAPK that is associated with cell proliferation. Inhibitors of JNK and p38, which are MAPKs associated with apoptosis, restored heteronemin-induced cell death. In addition, heteronemin treatment reduced the expression of GPX4, a protein that inhibits ferroptosis, which is a novel form of nonapoptotic programmed cell death. Ferroptosis inhibitor treatment also restored heteronemin-induced cell death. Thus, with appropriate structural modification, heteronemin can act as a potent therapeutic against HCC.
32935181/Pattern of treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and pain: evidence on pharmacoutilization from a large real-world sample and from a centre for cognitive disturbances and dementia Purpose Data concerning the number of diagnoses and of the drugs prescribed to patients affected by dementia are still scarce. Here we test whether or not (1) prescription of symptomatic drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) may approximate the number of patients affected by dementia in Italy and (2) adherence to this treatment affects the pattern of prescription of drugs (i.e. antipsychotics and antidepressants) for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and the previously reported limited prescription of analgesics. Methods This retrospective observational study concerns 84,235 subjects older than 60 years and registered in the provincial prescription database of the health district of Cosenza accounting for a population of 298,000 inhabitants. The prescribing pattern of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and analgesics has been investigated in patients receiving concurrent prescriptions of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) and/or memantine. Data from a single centre for cognitive disturbances and dementia (CDCD) in the same health district were used to explore at which stage dementia was diagnosed. The study was approved by Calabria Region Ethical Committee no. 31/2017 and registered on October 31, 2017. Results The data show that 859 patients are treated with AChEI and/or memantine; 420 patients (48.89%) receive at least 80% of the recommended medications. CDCD data indicate a delay in dementia diagnosis, which often was made when the patients were moderately to severely demented (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE <= 20). Adherence did not influence prescription of most of the drugs explored, but use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was higher in non-adherent patients. Antipsychotics and antidepressants are frequently used (20.61-20.71% and 42.37-51.43%, respectively), and this, at least in part, might stem from the observed under-treatment of chronic pain (opioids are prescribed in the 4.76% and 12.46% of adherent and non-adherent patients and gabapentin and pregabalin are used in the 4.29% and 4.07% of adherent and non-adherent patients respectively), resulting in more frequent BPSD. 16.43% of patients receive antipsychotics for longer than 6-12 weeks. Conclusion This 2-year period study, including a wide cohort of community demented patients, shows that dementia is diagnosed late and that prevalence of BPSD prescriptions is high and not impacted by adherence to anti-dementia drugs. The rate of prescription of potentially harmful antipsychotics and antidepressants appears to be high though whether the concomitantly observed limited prescription of analgesics might be a contributing factor needs to be further investigated. Our data support the development of strategies to improve the management of BPSD.
32901348/Serotonin syndrome by drug interactions with linezolid: clues from pharmacovigilance-pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis Purpose To characterize the post-marketing reporting of serotonin syndrome (SS) due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with linezolid and investigate the relationship with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of serotonergic agents. Methods We queried the worldwide FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to extract SS records due to DDIs where linezolid was reported as suspect. For each serotonergic agent concomitantly reported, proportion of SS reports and mean number of DDIs were calculated and three different "SS reporting zones" were created. Relevant PK (peak concentration, area under plasma concentration curve, volume of distribution (VD), and lipophilicity) and PD (values of binding affinity (Ki) and IC50 for serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A) parameters were extracted for each serotonergic agent, and relevant PK/PD indexes were calculated to assess correlation with mean number of DDIs (PV index). Results Six hundred sixty-nine reports of SS mentioning linezolid were found, being linezolid-citalopram (N = 69; 10.3%) the most frequently DDI reported. Citalopram and methadone showed respectively the highest proportion of SS reports (0.28%) and the lowest mean number of DDIs (1.41). Citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone emerged as red (i.e., alert)-zone medications: they exhibited high lipophilicity and large VD (proxies of excellent central nervous system penetration) coupled with high potency. Among PK/PD indexes, a significant correlation with PV index was found for VD/Ki SERT ratio (p = 0.05). Discussion Our integrated approach suggests that linezolid is more likely to cause SS when co-administered with citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone, as inferred from their pharmacological properties. Proper management of SS should be tailored on a case-by-case basis.

33319340/A real or apparent decrease in glomerular filtration rate in patients using olaparib? Purpose Olaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for ovarian and metastatic breast cancer. Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed in patients taking olaparib, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to investigate if patients receiving olaparib have increased creatinine levels during olaparib treatment and whether this actually relates to a declined glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Methods We retrospectively identified patients using olaparib at the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (NKI-AVL) from 2012 until 2020. Patients with at least one plasma or serum sample available at baseline/off treatment and during olaparib treatment were included. Cystatin C levels were measured, creatinine levels were available and renal function was determined by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Creatinine Equation (CKD-EPI 2009) and the Cystatin C Equation (CKD-EPI 2012). Results In total, 66 patients were included. Olaparib treatment was associated with a 14% increase in median creatinine from 72 (inter quartile range (IQR): 22) mumol/L before/off treatment to 82 (IQR: 20) mumol/L during treatment (p < 0.001) and a 13% decrease in median creatinine-derived eGFR from 86 (IQR: 26) mL/min/1.73 m2 before/off treatment to 75 (IQR: 29) mL/min/1.73 m2 during treatment (p < 0.001). Olaparib treatment had no significant effect on median cystatin C levels (p = 0.520) and the median cystatin C-derived eGFR (p = 0.918). Conclusions This study demonstrates that olaparib likely causes inhibition of renal transporters leading to a reversible and dose-dependent increase in creatinine and does not affect GFR, since the median cystatin C-derived eGFR was comparable before/off treatment and during treatment of olaparib. Using the creatinine-derived eGFR can give an underestimation of GFR in patients taking olaparib. Therefore, an alternative renal marker such as cystatin C should be used to accurately calculate eGFR in patients taking olaparib.
33505592/Astaxanthin Alleviates Ochratoxin A-Induced Cecum Injury and Inflammation in Mice by Regulating the Diversity of Cecal Microbiota and TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB Signaling Pathway Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a common environmental pollutant found in a variety of foods and grains, and excessive OTA consumption causes serious global health effects on animals and humans. Astaxanthin (AST) is a natural carotenoid that has anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, immunomodulatory, antitumor, antidiabetes, and other biological activities. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of AST on OTA-induced cecum injury and its mechanism of action. Eighty C57 mice were randomly divided into four groups, including the control group, OTA group (5 mg/kg body weight), AST group (100 mg/kg body weight), and AST intervention group (100 mg/kg body weight AST+5 mg/kg body weight OTA). It was found that AST decreased the endotoxin content, effectively prevented the shortening of mouse cecum villi, and increased the expression levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, consisting of occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). AST increased the number of goblet cells, the contents of mucin-2 (MUC2), and defensins (Defa5 and beta-pD2) significantly, while the expression of mucin-1 (MUC1) decreased significantly. The 16S rRNA sequencing showed that AST affected the richness and diversity of cecum flora, decreased the proportion of lactobacillus, and also decreased the contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetate and butyrate). In addition, AST significantly decreased the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and p-p65, while increasing the expression of p65. Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory factors including TNF-alpha and INF-gamma decreased, while the expression of IL-10 increased. In conclusion, AST reduced OTA-induced cecum injury by regulating the cecum barrier function and TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
33156400/Non-targeted screening workflows for gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis and identification of biomagnifying contaminants in biota samples The health of key species in the Baltic region has been impaired by exposure to anthropogenic hazardous substances (AHSs), which accumulate in organisms and are transferred through food chains. There is, thus, a need for comprehensive characterization of the occurrence and accumulation of AHSs in the ecosystem. In this study, we use a non-target screening (NTS) approach for this purpose. A major challenge in NTS of biological samples is the removal of matrix components such as lipids that may interfere with the detection and identification of compounds of interest. Here, we combine gel permeation chromatography with Florisil  column fractionation to achieve sufficient lipid removal for gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis using electron ionization (EI) and electron capture negative ion chemical ionization (ECNI). In addition, we present new data processing workflows designed to systematically find and identify frequently occurring and biomagnifying AHSs, including known, emerging, and new contaminants. Using these workflows, we discovered a wide range of contaminants in tissue samples from blue mussels, fish, and marine mammals, and calculated their biomagnification factors (BMFs). Compounds with BMFs above 1 for herring and at least one marine mammal included legacy chlorinated pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls, DDTs, chloro-benzenes/cyclohexanes, chlordanes, toxaphenes, dieldrin), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and brominated biphenyls. However, there were also several halogenated natural products (halogenated methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers, 1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrroles, 1,1'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyrroles, and the halogenated monoterpene mixed halogenated compound 1) as well as the novel flame retardant Dechlorane 602 and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, and steroids. The legacy pollutants exhibited the expected biomagnification behavior, demonstrating the utility of the unguided data processing workflow.

33130974/Correlated fluorescence microscopy and multi-ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging reveals phosphatidylethanolamine increases in the membrane of cancer cells over-expressing the molecular chaperone subunit CCTdelta Changes in the membrane composition of sub-populations of cells can influence different properties with importance to tumour growth, metastasis and treatment efficacy. In this study, we use correlated fluorescence microscopy and ToF-SIMS with C60+ and (CO2)6k+ ion beams to identify and characterise sub-populations of cells based on successful transfection leading to over-expression of CCTdelta, a component of the multi-subunit molecular chaperone named chaperonin-containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT). CCT has been linked to increased cell growth and proliferation and is known to affect cell morphology but corresponding changes in lipid composition of the membrane have not been measured until now. Multivariate analysis of the surface mass spectra from single cells, focused on the intact lipid ions, indicates an enrichment of phosphatidylethanolamine species in the transfected cells. While the lipid changes in this case are driven by the structural changes in the protein cytoskeleton, the consequence of phosphatidylethanolamine enrichment may have additional implications in cancer such as increased membrane fluidity, increased motility and an ability to adapt to a depletion of unsaturated lipids during cancer cell proliferation. This study demonstrates a successful fluorescence microscopy-guided cell by cell membrane lipid analysis with broad application to biological investigation.

33140127/Exploring extra dimensions to capture saliva metabolite fingerprints from metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese patients by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography featuring Tandem Ionization mass spectrometry This study examines the information potential of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF MS) and variable ionization energy (i.e., Tandem Ionization ) to study changes in saliva metabolic signatures from a small group of obese individuals. The study presents a proof of concept for an effective exploitation of the complementary nature of tandem ionization data. Samples are taken from two sub-populations of severely obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2) patients, named metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Untargeted fingerprinting, based on pattern recognition by template matching, is applied on single data streams and on fused data, obtained by combining raw signals from the two ionization energies (12 and 70 eV). Results indicate that at lower energy (i.e., 12 eV), the total signal intensity is one order of magnitude lower compared to the reference signal at 70 eV, but the ranges of variations for 2D peak responses is larger, extending the dynamic range. Fused data combine benefits from 70 eV and 12 eV resulting in more comprehensive coverage by sample fingerprints. Multivariate statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) show quite good patient clustering, with total explained variance by the first two principal components (PCs) that increases from 54% at 70 eV to 59% at 12 eV and up to 71% for fused data. With PLS-DA, discriminant components are highlighted and putatively identified by comparing retention data and 70 eV spectral signatures. Within the most informative analytes, lactose is present in higher relative amount in saliva from MHO patients, whereas N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, urea, glucuronic acid gamma-lactone, 2-deoxyribose, N-acetylneuraminic acid methyl ester, and 5-aminovaleric acid are more abundant in MUO patients. Visual feature fingerprinting is combined with pattern recognition algorithms to highlight metabolite variations between composite per-class images obtained by combining raw data from individuals belonging to different classes, i.e., MUO vs. MHO.

33123762/Adduct annotation in liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry to enhance compound identification Annotation and interpretation of full scan electrospray mass spectra of metabolites is complicated by the presence of a wide variety of ions. Not only protonated, deprotonated, and neutral loss ions but also sodium, potassium, and ammonium adducts as well as oligomers are frequently observed. This diversity challenges automatic annotation and is often poorly addressed by current annotation tools. In many cases, annotation is integrated in metabolomics workflows and is based on specific chromatographic peak-picking tools. We introduce mzAdan, a nonchromatography-based multipurpose standalone application that was developed for the annotation and exploration of convolved high-resolution ESI-MS spectra. The tool annotates single or multiple accurate mass spectra using a customizable adduct annotation list and outputs a list of [M+H]+ candidates. MzAdan was first tested with a collection of 408 analytes acquired with flow injection analysis. This resulted in 402 correct [M+H]+ identifications and, with combinations of sodium, ammonium, and potassium adducts and water and ammonia losses within a tolerance of 10 mmu, explained close to 50% of the total ion current. False positives were monitored with mass accuracy and bias as well as chromatographic behavior which led to the identification of adducts with calcium instead of the expected potassium. MzAdan was then integrated in a workflow with XCMS for the untargeted LC-MS data analysis of a 52 metabolite standard mix and a human urine sample. The results were benchmarked against three other annotation tools, CAMERA, findMAIN, and CliqueMS: findMAIN and mzAdan consistently produced higher numbers of [M+H]+ candidates compared with CliqueMS and CAMERA, especially with co-eluting metabolites. Detection of low-intensity ions and correct grouping were found to be essential for annotation performance.

33441158/The effect of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on exercise-induced muscle damage Background Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) results in transient muscle inflammation, strength loss, muscle soreness and may cause subsequent exercise avoidance. Omega-3 (n-3) supplementation may minimise EIMD via its anti-inflammatory properties, however, its efficacy remains unclear. Methods Healthy males (n = 14, 25.07 +- 4.05 years) were randomised to 3 g/day n-3 supplementation (N-3, n = 7) or placebo (PLA, n = 7). Following 4 weeks supplementation, a downhill running protocol (60 min, 65% VO2max, - 10% gradient) was performed. Creatine kinase (CK), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, perceived muscle soreness, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and peak power were quantified pre, post, and 24, 48 and 72 h post-EIMD. Results Muscle soreness was significantly lower in N-3 vs PLA group at 24 h post-EIMD (p = 0.034). IL-6 was increased in PLA (p = 0.009) but not in N-3 (p = 0.434) following EIMD, however, no significant differences were noted between groups. Peak power was significantly suppressed in PLA relative to pre-EIMD but not in N-3 group at 24 h post-EIMD. However, no significant difference in peak power output was observed between groups. MVIC, CK and TNF-alpha were altered by EIMD but did not differ between groups. Conclusion N-3 supplementation for 4 weeks may successfully attenuate minor aspects of EIMD. Whilst not improving performance, these findings may have relevance to soreness-associated exercise avoidance.

33446181/Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial Background Long-term antithyroid drug therapy has become one of the options for treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The aim of this study was to compare thyroid status in those who discontinued methimazole (MMI) treatment after 12.8 years with those who continued MMI as long as 24 years. Methods Fifty nine patients with Graves' disease on long-term MMI for 14.2 +- 2.9 years were recruited; 32 patients (54%) decided to discontinue MMI and 27 (46%) preferred additional years of MMI treatment. All patients were followed for a mean of 6 additional years. Results Of 27 patients who continued MMI up to 24 years, suppressed serum thyrotropin (TSH) was not observed in any patient after the seventh year of treatment. Serum free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, TSH and TSH receptor antibody concentrations remained normal up to the length of the study. Mean daily dose of MMI to maintain TSH in the reference range decreased gradually and reached to 2.8 +- 1.7 mg by 24 years of MMI treatment. No adverse reaction related to MMI occured during additional years of therapy. In 32 patients who discontinued MMI, hyperthyroidism relapsed in 6 patients (19%), one left follow-up and 25 (78%) remained euthyroid during the study. Conclusions Long-term low dose MMI treatment may be a lifelong effective and safe therapeutic modality in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism for prevention of relapse, if studies from other centers confirm findings of this research.

33446171/Luteolin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced microcirculatory disturbance through inhibiting leukocyte adhesion in rat mesenteric venules Background Microcirculatory disturbance is closely associated with multiple diseases such as ischemic and septic stroke. Luteolin (3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a vascular protective flavonoid present in several dietary foods. However, how luteolin plays a role in microcirculatory disturbance is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to find out the influence of luteolin on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microcirculatory disturbance, focusing on its effect on leukocyte adhesion and the underlying mechanism of this effect. Methods After injecting LPS into rats, we used an inverted intravital microscope to observe the velocity of red blood cells in venules, numbers of leukocytes adherent to and emigrated across the venular wall, hydrogen peroxide production in venular walls and mast cell degranulation. Intestinal microcirculation blood flow was measured by High-resolution Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging. Histological changes of small intestine and mesenteric arteries were evaluated. Additionally, cell adhesion stimulated by LPS was tested on EA.hy926 and THP-1 cells. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and the activation of TLR4/Myd88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway were determined. Results The results showed luteolin significantly inhibited LPS-induced leukocyte adhesion, hydrogen peroxide production and mast cell degranulation, and increased intestinal microcirculation blood flow and ameliorated pathological changes in the mesenteric artery and the small intestine. Furthermore, luteolin inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the expression of TLR4, Myd88, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and NF-kappaB/p65 in LPS stimulated EA.hy926. Conclusions Our findings revealed that it is likely that luteolin can ameliorate microcirculatory disturbance. The inhibitory effects of luteolin on the leukocyte adhesion stimulated by LPS, which participates in the development of microcirculatory disturbance, are mediated through the regulation of the TLR4/Myd88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

33417512/Berberine regulates the Notch1/PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and acts synergistically with 17-AAG and SAHA in SW480 colon cancer cells Abstract Context Berberine (BBR) is used to treat diarrhoea and gastroenteritis in the clinic. It was found to have anticolon cancer effects. Objective To study the anticolon cancer mechanism of BBR by connectivity map (CMAP) analysis. Materials and methods CMAP based mechanistic prediction was conducted by comparing gene expression profiles of 10 muM BBR treated MCF-7 cells with that of clinical drugs such as helveticoside, ianatoside C, pyrvinium, gossypol and trifluoperazine. The treatment time was 12 h and two biological replications were performed. The DMSO-treated cells were selected as a control. The interaction between 100 muM BBR and target protein was measured by cellular thermal shift assay. The protein expression of 1-9 muM BBR treated SW480 cells were measured by WB assay. Apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of 1-9 muM BBR treated SW480 cells were measured by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining methods. Results CMAP analysis found 14 Hsp90, HDAC, PI3K or mTOR protein inhibitors have similar functions with BBR. The experiments showed that BBR inhibited SW480 cells proliferation with IC50 of 3.436 muM, induced apoptosis, autophage, MMP depolarization and arrested G1 phase of cell cycle at 1.0 muM. BBR dose-dependently up-regulated PTEN, while inhibited Notch1, PI3K, Akt and mTOR proteins at 1.0-9.0 muM (p < 0.05). BBR also acted synergistically with Hsp90 and HDAC inhibitor (0.01 muM) in SW480 cells at 0.5 and 1.0 muM. Discussion and conclusions The integrative gene expression-based chemical genomic method using CMAP analysis may be applicable for mechanistic studies of other multi-targets drugs.
33427520/Anti-tumor effect of local injectable hydrogel-loaded endostatin alone and in combination with radiotherapy for lung cancer Abstract Endostatin (ES) can effectively inhibit neovascularization in most solid tumors and has the potential to make oxygen delivery more efficient and increase the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT). With a short half-life, ES is mainly administered systemically, which leads to low intake in tumor tissue and often toxic systemic side effects. In this study, we used hyaluronic acid-tyramine as a carrier to synthesize an ES-loaded hydrogel drug (ES/HA-Tyr) that can be injected locally. ES/HA-Tyr has a longer half-life and fewer systemic toxic side effects, and it exerts a better anti-angiogenic effect and anti-tumor effect with RT. In vitro, ES/HA-Tyr showed sustained release in the release assay and a stronger ability to inhibit the proliferation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the MTT assay; it exhibited a more potent effect against HUVEC invasion and a stronger anti-angiogenic effect on HUVECs in tube formation. In vivo, ES/HA-Tyr increased local drug concentration, decreased blood drug concentration, and caused less systemic toxicity. Further, ES/HA-Tyr effectively reduced tumor microvessel density, increased tumor pericyte coverage, decreased tumor hypoxia, and increased RT response. ES/HA-Tyr + RT also had increased anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects in Lewis lung cancer (LLC) xenograft models. In conclusion, ES/HA-Tyr showed sustained release, lower systemic toxicity, and better anti-tumor effects than ES. In addition, ES/HA-Tyr + RT enhanced anti-angiogenic effects, reduced tumor hypoxia, and increased the efficacy of RT in LLC-bearing mice.
33444365/Arachis hypogaea resveratrol synthase 3 alters the expression pattern of UDP-glycosyltransferase genes in developing rice seeds The resveratrol-producing rice (Oryza sativa L.) inbred lines, Iksan 515 (I.515) and Iksan 526 (I.526), developed by the expression of the groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) resveratrol synthase 3 (AhRS3) gene in the japonica rice cultivar Dongjin, accumulated both resveratrol and its glucoside, piceid, in seeds. Here, we investigated the effect of the AhRS3 transgene on the expression of endogenous piceid biosynthesis genes (UGTs) in the developing seeds of the resveratrol-producing rice inbred lines. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis revealed that I.526 accumulates significantly higher resveratrol and piceid in seeds than those in I.515 seeds and, in I.526 seeds, the biosynthesis of resveratrol and piceid reached peak levels at 41 days after heading (DAH) and 20 DAH, respectively. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression patterns of UGT genes differed significantly between the 20 DAH seeds of I.526 and those of Dongjin. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses confirmed the data from RNA-seq analysis in seeds of Dongjin, I.515 and I.526, respectively, at 9 DAH, and in seeds of Dongjin and I.526, respectively, at 20 DAH. A total of 245 UGTs, classified into 31 UGT families, showed differential expression between Dongjin and I.526 seeds at 20 DAH. Of these, 43 UGTs showed more than 2-fold higher expression in I.526 seeds than in Dongjin seeds. In addition, the expression of resveratrol biosynthesis genes (PAL, C4H and 4CL) was also differentially expressed between Dongjin and I.526 developing seeds. Collectively, these data suggest that AhRS3 altered the expression pattern of UGT genes, and PAL, C4H and 4CL in developing rice seeds.
33444342/PGE2 upregulates the Na+/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells via EP4 receptors and intracellular calcium The Na+/K+ ATPase is a key regulator of the hepatocytes ionic homeostasis, which when altered may lead to many liver disorders. We demonstrated recently, a significant stimulation of the Na+/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells treated with the S1P analogue FTY 720P, that was mediated through PGE2. The mechanism by which the prostaglandin exerts its effect was not investigated, and is the focus of this work. The type of receptors involved was determined using pharmacological inhibitors, while western blot analysis, fluorescence imaging of GFP-tagged Na+/K+ ATPase, and time-lapse imaging on live cells were used to detect changes in membrane abundance of the Na+/K+ ATPase. The activity of the ATPase was assayed by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated in the presence and absence of ouabain. The enhanced activity of the ATPase was not observed when EP4 receptors were blocked but still appeared in presence inhibitors of EP1, EP2 and EP3 receptors. The involvement of EP4 was confirmed by the stimulation observed with EP4 agonist. The stimulatory effect of PGE2 did not appear in presence of Rp-cAMP, an inhibitor of PKA, and was imitated by db-cAMP, a PKA activator. Chelating intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM abrogated the effect of db-cAMP as well as that of PGE2, but PGE2 treatment in a calcium-free PBS medium did not, suggesting an involvement of intracellular calcium, that was confirmed by the results obtained with 2-APB treatment. Live cell imaging showed movement of GFP-Na+/K+ ATPase-positive vesicles to the membrane and increased abundance of the ATPase at the membrane after PGE2 treatment. It was concluded that PGE2 acts via EP4, PKA, and intracellular calcium.
33427515/Berberine-10-hydroxy camptothecine-loaded lipid microsphere for the synergistic treatment of liver cancer by inhibiting topoisomerase and HIF-1alpha Abstract 10-HCPT is a topoisomerase I inhibitor effective in the treatment of liver cancer but its use is hampered by its resistance. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is reportedly upregulated in liver cancer tissues, which is directly linked to the resistance of 10-HCPT. While BBR can significantly decrease the level of HIF-1alpha according to the literature report. Thus, the aim of this study was to prepare a novel intravenous 10-HCPT-BBR-loaded lipid microsphere (LM) and evaluate their synergistic effect on liver cancer treatment. The optimal preparation mainly included 10.0% oil phase (medium-chain triglyceride:long-chain triglyceride = 1:1), emulsifier (egg lecithin E80 and pluronic F68), antioxidant (0.02% NaHSO3), and pH regulator (0.1 mol/L Hcl). Then, the behaviors of BBR-10-HCPT loaded LM in vitro and in vivo were systematically investigated. In vitro, it showed an obvious sustained-release effect in different release mediums, good physicochemical stability at accelerated and long-term storage conditions, and great anti-proliferative capability toward human liver cancer Hep-3B cells. In vivo, the prepared LM exhibited a longer half-life and higher AUC compared to BBR injection and 10-HCPT injection. More importantly, it was found that The LM was distributed more in the liver, spleen, and tumors, but less in the lungs and heart, especially in the lung. And then, it showed significant inhibition of tumor growth against nude mouse with Hep-3B tumor, and the tumor inhibition rate reached 91.55%. Thus, the data obtained in our study suggested that BBR combined with 10-HCPT can raise curative effect and reduce the toxicity of 10-HCPT.
33505584/An Impact of Psychological Stress on the Interplay between Salivary Oxidative Stress and the Classic Psychological Stress-Related Parameters Both oxidative and psychological (mental) stress are the likely culprits for several acute and chronic health disturbances, and adequate tests mimicking that are needed. Herein, in controlled laboratory surroundings, a PEBL (Psychology Experiment Building Language) test battery was used to evoke stress-related biological responses followed by tracking changes in saliva parameters. The study objectives were to determine the impact of psychological stress on selected salivatory parameters and to assess the correlation between the determined oxidative and stress parameters. The study was conducted on 36 healthy young subjects, mainly females (n = 24). Before and following the completion of a battery of four PEBL tests, subjects' saliva samples were collected. Stress-evoking changes in total antioxidant capacity and nitrite/nitrate levels, as oxidative stress parameters, and cortisol and immunoglobulin A (IgA), as parameters of psychological stress, were established and mutually correlated by comparing the values of the evaluated parameters pre- and post-PEBL test. The results showed that there is no change in the total salivary antioxidant capacity (p > 0.05); however, there was a significant increase in nitrites/nitrates levels after the PEBL test (p = 0.007). On the other hand, the determined cortisol levels after the test battery were found to be statistically significantly increased (p = 0.025) when compared to the values obtained before the test, while the levels of IgA were found to be statistically significantly decreased (p < 0.001). The only statistically significant correlation between the changes in the studied parameters was found to be the one between cortisol and IgA levels (Spearman's Ro = -0.4). These results suggest that the short-term stress induced by the PEBL test does evoke changes in the salivary mental stress-related parameters (an increase in cortisol and nitrite/nitrate levels, and a decrease in IgA), but not in the total antioxidant capacity. They also indicate that the constructed PEBL four-test battery might represent an adequate laboratory stress-inducing paradigm.
33446155/Polyphenolics and triterpenes presence in chloroform extract of Dicranopteris linearis leaves attenuated paracetamol-induced liver intoxication in rat Introduction Water-soluble, but not lipid-soluble, extract of Dicranopteris linearis leaves has been proven to possess hepatoprotective activity. The present study aimed to validate the hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities, and phytoconstituents of lipid-soluble (chloroform) extract of D. linearis leaves. Methods The extract of D. linearis leaves (CEDL; 50, 250 and 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to rats for 7 consecutive days followed by the oral administration of 3 g/kg PCM to induce liver injury. Blood was collected for liver function analysis while the liver was obtained for histopathological examination and endogenous antioxidant activity determination. The extract was also subjected to antioxidant evaluation and phytochemicals determination via phytochemical screening, HPLC and UPLC-HRMS analyses. Results CEDL exerted significant (p < 0.05) hepatoprotective activity at 250 and 500 mg/kg and significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the PCM-induced decrease in rat's liver endogenous antioxidant (catalase and superoxide dismutase) level. CEDL possessed a high antioxidant capacity when measured using the ORAC assay, but a low total phenolic content value and radical scavenging activity as confirmed via several radical scavenging assays, which might be attributed particularly to the presence of triterpenes. Phytochemicals screening demonstrated the presence of triterpenes and flavonoids, while UPLC-HRMS analysis showed the presence of polyphenols belonging to the hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinammates and flavonoid groups. Discussion and conclusion Lipid-soluble bioactive compounds of CEDL demonstrated hepatoprotective effect against PCM intoxication partly via the modulation of the endogenous antioxidant defense system, and exerted high antioxidant capacity. Further investigation is warranted to identify the potential hepatoprotective leads from CEDL for future drug development.
33446187/The pro-apoptosis effects of Echinacea purpurea and Cannabis sativa extracts in human lung cancer cells through caspase-dependent pathway Background Considering the advantages of using medicinal herbs as supplementary treatments to sensitize conventional anti-cancer drugs, studying functional mechanisms and regulatory effects of Echinacea purpurea (as a non-cannabinoid plant) and Cannabis sativa (as a cannabinoid plant) are timely and required. The potential effects of such herbs on lung cancer cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, caspase activity and their cannabinomimetic properties on the CB2 receptor are addressed in the current study. Methods The cytotoxic effect of both herb extracts on the growth of lung cancer cells (A549) was assessed using the MTT assay. The annexin-V-FITC staining and propidium iodide (PI) staining methods were applied for the detection of apoptosis and cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry. The cellular level of ROS was measured using 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) as a fluorescent probe in flow cytometry. The caspase 3 activity was assessed using a colorimetric assay Kit. Results Echinacea purpurea (EP) root extract induced a considerable decrease in A549 viable cells, showing a time and dose-dependent response. The cell toxicity of EP was accompanied by induction of early apoptosis and cell accumulation at the sub G1 phase of the cell cycle. The elevation of cellular ROS level and caspase 3 activity indicate ROS-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis following the treatment of A549 cells by EP extract. The observed effects of EP extract on A549 growth and death were abrogated following blockage of CB2 using AM630, a specific antagonist of the CB2 receptor. Increasing concentrations of Cannabis sativa (CS) induced A549 cell death in a time-dependent manner, followed by induction of early apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at sub G1 phase, elevation of ROS level, and activation of caspase 3. The CB2 blockage caused attenuation of CS effects on A549 cell death which revealed consistency with the effects of EP extract on A549 cells. Conclusions The pro-apoptotic effects of EP and CS extracts on A549 cells and their possible regulatory role of CB2 activity might be attributed to metabolites of both herbs. These effects deserve receiving more attention as alternative anti-cancer agents. Graphical abstract
33451293/Survival benefit of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD) over lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients in routine clinical practice Background We have performed a head to head comparison of all-oral triplet combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in the routine clinical practice. Methods A total of 344 patients treated with IRD (N = 127) or RD (N = 217) were selected for analysis from the Czech Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG). Descriptive statistics were used to assess patient's characteristics associated with the respective therapy. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), secondary end points included response rates and overall survival (OS). Survival endpoints were plotted using Kaplan-Meier methodology at 95% Greenwood confidence interval. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment regimens and the significance of uneven variables. Statistical tests were performed at significance level 0.05. Results In the whole cohort, median PFS for IRD was 17.5 and for RD was 11.5 months favoring the all-oral triplet, p = 0.005; in patients within relapse 1-3, the median PFS was 23.1 vs 11.6 months, p = 0.001. The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.89, p = 0.006). The PFS advantage translated into improved OS for patients treated with IRD, median 36.6 months vs 26.0 months (p = 0.008). The overall response rate (ORR) was 73.0% in the IRD group vs 66.2% in the RD group with a complete response rate (CR) of 11.1% vs 8.8%, and very good partial response (VGPR) 22.2% vs 13.9%, IRD vs RD respectively. The IRD regimen was most beneficial in patients <=75 years with ISS I, II, and in the first and second relapse. Patients with the presence of extramedullary disease did not benefit from IRD treatment (median PFS 6.5 months). Both regimens were well tolerated, and the incidence of total as well as grade 3/4 toxicities was comparable. Conclusions Our analysis confirms the results of the TOURMALINE-MM1 study and shows benefit of all-oral triplet IRD treatment versus RD doublet. It demonstrates that the addition of ixazomib to RD improves key survival endpoints in patients with RRMM in a routine clinical setting.
33505590/Cyclosporine A Promotes Bone Remodeling in LPS-Related Inflammation via Inhibiting ROS/ERK Signaling: Studies In Vivo and In Vitro In some inflammatory diseases of bone, osteogenesis and osteoclasis are uncoupled and the balance is usually tipped resulting in bone destruction. The underlying mechanism of osteogenic dysfunction in inflammation still needs further study. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of cyclosporine A (CsA) on bone remodeling in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) related inflammation. In vivo, an alveolar bone defect model was established using 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice. The mice were divided into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), LPS, and LPS+CsA groups. After 3 weeks, micro-CT analysis and histomorphometric evaluation were conducted. In vitro, murine osteoblasts were treated with vehicle medium, LPS, LPS+CsA, LPS+extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor (LPS+PD98059), and LPS+antioxidant (LPS+EUK134). Cell proliferation, osteogenic behaviors, oxidative stress, and ERK signaling were determined. By these approaches, LPS inhibited bone remodeling and promoted oxidative stress accumulation in alveolar bone defects. When animals were treated with CsA, all LPS-induced biochemical changes ameliorated with a marked protective effect. In vitro, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in mitochondria increased in LPS-treated osteoblasts, with decreased expression of osteogenic differentiation genes. The CsA, PD98059, and EUK134 presented remarkable protective effects against LPS treatment. CsA effectively enhanced bone remodeling and attenuated oxidative stress caused by LPS via inhibiting ROS/ERK signaling. Taken together, the protective effect of CsA and the inhibitory effect of ERK signaling on the maintenance of mitochondrial function and reduction of ROS levels hold promise as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory diseases in bones.
33451299/Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with carboplatin plus pemetrexed or carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients with lung cancer: a propensity score-matched analysis Background Patients with lung cancer who are treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens often experience chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). However, knowledge on the effect of regimen and cofactors on the risk of CINV is limited. This study aimed to analyze and compare the incidence of CINV between lung cancer patients undergoing carboplatin plus pemetrexed (CBDCA+PEM) and those undergoing carboplatin plus paclitaxel (CBDCA+PTX) chemotherapy. Methods Pooled data of 240 patients from two prospective observational studies were compared using propensity score matching. Separate multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. Results Delayed nausea was significantly more common in patients treated with CBDCA+PEM than in those treated with CBDCA+PTX (51.1% vs. 36.2%, P = 0.04), but the incidence of vomiting did not significantly differ between the two groups (23.4% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.14). The occurrence of CINV peaked on day 4 in the CBDCA+PTX group and on day 5 in the CBDCA+PEM group. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex, younger age, and CBDCA+PEM regimen were independent risk factors for delayed nausea, while female sex was an independent risk factor for delayed vomiting. Conclusions The CBDCA + PEM regimen has a higher risk of causing delayed nausea than the CBDCA + PTX regimen, and aggressive antiemetic prophylaxis should be offered to patients treated with CBDCA + PEM.

33451287/Effect of chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes on the leaf color in Hosta (Hosta plantaginea Aschers) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) Background 'Regal Splendour' (Hosta variety) is famous for its multi-color leaves, which are useful resources for exploring chloroplast development and color changes. The expressions of chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes (HrHEMA, HrPOR and HrCAO) in Hosta have been demonstrated to be associated with leaf color. Herein, we isolated, sequenced, and analyzed HrHEMA, HrPOR and HrCAO genes. Subcellular localization was also performed to determine the location of the corresponding enzymes. After plasmid construction, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was carried out to reduce the expressions of those genes. In addition, HrHEMA-, HrPOR- and HrCAO-overexpressing tobacco plants were made to verify the genes function. Changes of transgenic tobacco were recorded under 2000 lx, 6000 lx and 10,000 lx light intensity. Additionally, the contents of enzyme 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), chlorophyll a and b (Chla and Chlb), carotenoid (Cxc), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline (Pro) and catalase (CAT) under different light intensities were evaluated. Results The silencing of HrHEMA, HrPOR and HrCAO genes can induce leaf yellowing and chloroplast structure changes in Hosta. Specifically, leaves of Hosta with HrCAO silencing were the most affected, while those with HrPOR silencing were the least affected. Moreover, all three genes in tobacco were highly expressed, whereas no expression was detected in wild-type (WT). However, the sensitivities of the three genes to different light intensities were different. The highest expression level of HrHEMA and HrPOR was detected under 10,000 lx of illumination, while HrCAO showed the highest expression level under 6000 lx. Lastly, the 5-ALA, Chla, Cxc, SOD, POD, MDA, Pro and CAT contents in different transgenic tobaccos changed significantly under different light intensities. Conclusion The overexpression of these three genes in tobacco enhanced photosynthesis by accumulating chlorophyll content, but the influential level varied under different light intensities. Furthermore, HrHEMA-, HrPOR- and HrCAO- overexpressing in tobacco can enhance the antioxidant capacity of plants to cope with stress under higher light intensity. However, under lower light intensity, the antioxidant capacity was declined in HrHEMA-, HrPOR- and HrCAO- overexpressing tobaccos.

33505591/Velvet Antler Methanol Extracts Ameliorate Parkinson's Disease by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation: From C. elegans to Mice Velvet antler is the traditional tonic food or medicine used in East Asia for treating aging-related diseases. Herein, we try to dissect the pharmacology of methanol extracts (MEs) of velvet antler on Parkinson's disease (PD). Caenorhabditis elegans studies showed that MEs decreased the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and protected oxidative stress-induced DAergic neuron degeneration. In vitro cellular data indicated that MEs suppressed the LPS-induced MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation, therefore inhibiting overproduction of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6; blocking microglia activation; and protecting DAergic neurons from the microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. In vivo MPTP-induced PD mouse investigations found that MEs prevented MPTP-induced neuron loss in the substantia nigra and improved the behavioral rotating rod performance in MPTP-treated mice by increasing the expression level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and downregulating alpha-synuclein protein expression. In all, these results demonstrate that MEs ameliorate PD by inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.
33461570/Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels are not associated with severity of liver disease and are inversely related to cholesterol in a cohort of thirty eight patients with liver cirrhosis Background Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is of particular importance in cholesterol metabolism with high levels contributing to hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol and sphingolipids are low in patients with liver cirrhosis. Purpose of this study was to find associations of plasma PCSK9 with circulating cholesterol and sphingolipid species and measures of liver disease severity in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods PCSK9 protein levels were determined by ELISA in systemic vein (SVP), hepatic vein (HVP) and portal vein plasma of patients with mostly alcoholic liver cirrhosis. PCSK9 and LDL-receptor protein expression were analysed in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver tissues. Results Serum PCSK9 was reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis in comparison to non-cirrhotic patients. In liver cirrhosis, plasma PCSK9 was not correlated with Child-Pugh score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, bilirubin or aminotransferases. A negative association of SVP PCSK9 with albumin existed. PCSK9 protein in the liver did not change with fibrosis stage and was even positively correlated with LDL-receptor protein levels. Ascites volume and variceal size were not related to PCSK9 levels. Along the same line, transjugular intrahepatic shunt to lower portal pressure did not affect PCSK9 concentrations in the three blood compartments. Serum cholesterol, sphingomyelin and ceramide levels did not correlate with PCSK9. Stratifying patients by high versus low PCSK9 levels using the median as cut-off, several cholesteryl ester species were even low in the subgroup with high PCSK9 levels. A few sphingomyelin species were also reduced in the patients with PCSK9 levels above the median. PCSK9 is highly expressed in the liver but systemic, portal and hepatic vein levels were similar. PCSK9 was not correlated with the inflammatory proteins C-reactive protein, IL-6, galectin-3, resistin or pentraxin 3. Of note, HVP PCSK9 was positively associated with HVP chemerin and negatively with HVP adiponectin levels. Conclusions In the cohort of patients with liver cirrhosis mostly secondary to alcohol consumption high PCSK9 was associated with low levels of certain cholesteryl ester and sphingomyelin species. Positive correlations of PCSK9 and LDL-receptor protein in the liver of patients with chronic liver injury are consistent with these findings.
33468127/Metabolic engineering of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 for production of pyridine-dicarboxylic acids from lignin Genetic modification of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 was carried out in order to optimise the production of pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid bioproducts from lignin or lignocellulose breakdown, via insertion of either the Sphingobium SYK-6 ligAB genes or Paenibacillus praA gene respectively. Insertion of inducible plasmid pTipQC2 expression vector containing either ligAB or praA genes into a DeltapcaHG R. jostii RHA1 gene deletion strain gave 2-threefold higher titres of PDCA production from lignocellulose (200-287 mg/L), compared to plasmid expression in wild-type R. jostii RHA1. The ligAB genes were inserted in place of the chromosomal pcaHG genes encoding protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, under the control of inducible Picl or PnitA promoters, or a constitutive Ptpc5 promoter, producing 2,4-PDCA products using either wheat straw lignocellulose or commercial soda lignin as carbon source. Insertion of Amycolatopsis sp. 75iv2 dyp2 gene on a pTipQC2 expression plasmid led to enhanced titres of 2,4-PDCA products, due to enhanced rate of lignin degradation. Growth in minimal media containing wheat straw lignocellulose led to the production of 2,4-PDCA in 330 mg/L titre in 40 h, with > tenfold enhanced productivity, compared with plasmid-based expression of ligAB genes in wild-type R. jostii RHA1. Production of 2,4-PDCA was also observed using several different polymeric lignins as carbon sources, and a titre of 240 mg/L was observed using a commercially available soda lignin as feedstock.
33468064/Lipases of germinating jojoba seeds efficiently hydrolyze triacylglycerols and wax esters and display wax ester-synthesizing activity Background Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) is the only plant known to store wax esters instead of triacylglycerols in its seeds. Wax esters are composed of very-long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and fatty alcohols and constitute up to 60% of the jojoba seed weight. During jojoba germination, the first step of wax ester mobilization is catalyzed by lipases. To date, none of the jojoba lipase-encoding genes have been cloned and characterized. In this study, we monitored mobilization of storage reserves during germination of jojoba seeds and performed detailed characterization of the jojoba lipases using microsomal fractions isolated from germinating seeds. Results During 26 days of germination, we observed a 60-70% decrease in wax ester content in the seeds, which was accompanied by the reduction of oleosin amounts and increase in glucose content. The activity of jojoba lipases in the seed microsomal fractions increased in the first 50 days of germination. The enzymes showed higher activity towards triacylglycerols than towards wax esters. The maximum lipase activity was observed at 60  C and pH around 7 for triacylglycerols and 6.5-8 for wax esters. The enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed various wax esters containing saturated and unsaturated acyl and alcohol moieties. We also demonstrated that jojoba lipases possess wax ester-synthesizing activity when free fatty alcohols and different acyl donors, including triacylglycerols and free fatty acids, are used as substrates. For esterification reactions, the enzyme utilized both saturated and unsaturated fatty alcohols, with the preference towards long chain and very long chain compounds. Conclusions In in vitro assays, jojoba lipases catalyzed hydrolysis of triacylglycerols and different wax esters in a broad range of temperatures. In addition, the enzymes had the ability to synthesize wax esters in the backward reaction. Our data suggest that jojoba lipases may be more similar to other plant lipases than previously assumed.

33461504/Auxin is involved in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-promoted tomato growth and NADP-malic enzymes expression in continuous cropping substrates Background Despite significant limitations of growth medium reuse, a large amount of organic substrate is reused in soilless cultivation of horticultural crops in China. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote nutrient absorption and improve plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the mechanisms governing the effects of AMF on crop growth in organic continuous cropping substrates have not been elucidated. Results In this study, we showed that the inoculation of AMF in continuous cropping substrates promoted growth and root development, and increased the root and NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) activity of tomato seedlings. Root transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the plant hormone signal transduction pathway was highly enriched, and 109 genes that positively correlated with the AMF-inoculated plant phenotype were obtained by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which identified 9 genes related to indole acetic acid (IAA). Importantly, the levels of endogenous IAA in tomato seedlings significantly increased after AMF inoculation. Furthermore, the application of AMF significantly increased the expression levels of NADP-ME1 and NADP-ME2, as well as the activity of NADP-ME, and enhanced the root activity of tomato seedlings in comparison to that observed without inoculation of AMF. However, these effects were blocked in plants treated with 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), a polar transport inhibitor of IAA. Conclusions These results suggest that IAA mediates the AMF-promoted tomato growth and expression of NADP-MEs in continuous cropping substrates. The study provides convincing evidence for the reuse of continuous cropping substrates by adding AMF as an amendment.

33465153/Glutamine and cystine-enriched diets modulate aquaporins gene expression in the small intestine of piglets The regulation of glycerol permeability in the gastrointestinal tract is crucial to control fat deposition, lipolysis and gluconeogenesis. Knowing that the amino acid glutamine is a physiological regulator of gluconeogenesis, whereas cystine promotes adiposity, herein we investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with glutamine and cystine on the serum biochemical parameters of piglets fed on amino acid-enriched diets, as well as on the transcriptional profile of membrane water and glycerol channels aquaporins (AQPs) in the ileum portion of the small intestine and its impact on intestinal permeability. Twenty male piglets with an initial body weight of 8.8 +- 0.89 kg were allocated to four dietary treatments (n = 5) and received, during a four week-period, a basal diet without supplementation (control) or supplemented with 8 kg/ton of glutamine (Gln), cystine (Cys) or the combination of the two amino acids in equal proportions (Gln + Cys). Most biochemical parameters were found improved in piglets fed Gln and Cys diet. mRNA levels of AQP3 were found predominant over the others. Both amino acids, individually or combined, were responsible for a consistent downregulation of AQP1, AQP7 and AQP10, without impacting on water permeability. Conversely, Cys enriched diet upregulated AQP3 enhancing basolateral membranes glycerol permeability and downregulating glycerol kinase (GK) of intestinal cells. Altogether, our data reveal that amino acids dietary supplementation can modulate intestinal AQPs expression and unveil AQP3 as a promising target for adipogenesis regulation.
33465130/The efficacy of different seed priming agents for promoting sorghum germination under salt stress Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] seed germination is sensitive to salinity, and seed priming is an effective method for alleviating the negative effects of salt stress on seed germination. However, few studies have compared the effects of different priming agents on sorghum germination under salt stress. In this study, we quantified the effects of priming with distilled water (HP), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on sorghum seed germination under 150 mM NaCl stress. The germination potential, germination rate, germination index, vigor index, root length, shoot length, root fresh weight, shoot fresh weight, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight were significantly reduced by salt stress. Different priming treatments alleviated the germination inhibition caused by salt stress to varying degrees, and 50 mM CaCl2 was the most effective treatment. In addition, the mitigation effect of priming was stronger on root traits than on shoot traits. Mitigation efficacy was closely related to both the type of agent and the concentration of the solution. Principal component analysis showed that all concentrations of CaCl2 had higher scores and were clearly distinguished from other treatments based on their positive effects on all germination traits. The effects of the other agents varied with concentration. The priming treatments were divided into three categories based on their priming efficacy, and the 50, 100, and 150 mM CaCl2 treatments were placed in the first category. The 150 mM KCl, 10% PEG, HP, 150 mM NaCl, 30% PEG, and 50 mM KCl treatments were placed in the second category, and the 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 20% PEG, and 50 mM NaCl treatments were least effective and were placed in the third category. Choosing appropriate priming agents and methods for future research and applications can ensure that crop seeds germinate healthily under saline conditions.
33469781/Human cardiomyocyte-derived exosomes induce cardiac gene expressions in mesenchymal stromal cells within 3D hyaluronic acid hydrogels and in dose-dependent manner Accomplishing a reliable lineage-specific differentiation of stem cells is vital in tissue engineering applications, however, this need remained unmet. Extracellular nanovesicles (particularly exosomes) have previously been shown to have this potential owing to their rich biochemical content including proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites. In this work, the potential of human cardiomyocytes-derived exosomes to induce in vitro cardiac gene expressions in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was evaluated. Cardiac exosomes (CExo) were integrated with hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel, which was functionalized with tyramine (HA-Tyr) to enable the development of 3D (three dimensional), robust and bioactive hybrid cell culture construct through oxidative coupling. In HA-Tyr/CExo 3D hybrid hydrogels, hMSCs exhibited good viability and proliferation behaviours. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results demonstrated that cells incubated within HA-Tyr/CExo expressed early cardiac progenitor cell markers (GATA4, Nkx2.5 and Tbx5), but not cTnT, which is expressed in the late stages of cardiac differentiation and development. The expressions of cardiac genes were remarkably increased with increasing CExo concentration, signifying a dose-dependent induction of hMSCs. This report, to some extent, explains the potential of tissue-specific exosomes to induce lineage-specific differentiation. However, the strategy requires further mechanistic explanations so that it can be utilized in translational medicine.
33469820/Effect of dexamethasone as osteogenic supplementation in in vitro osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth In in vitro culture systems, dexamethasone (DEX) has been applied with ascorbic acid (ASC) and beta-glycerophosphate (betaGLY) as culture media supplementation to induce osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. However, there are some inconsistencies regarding the role of DEX as osteogenic media supplementation. Therefore, this study verified the influence of DEX culture media supplementation on the osteogenic differentiation, especially the capacity to mineralize the extracellular matrix of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). Five groups were established: G1:SHED + Dulbecco's Modified Eagles' Medium (DMEM) + fetal bovine serum (FBS); G2:SHED + DMEM + FBS + DEX; G3:SHED + DMEM + FBS + ASC + betaGLY; G4:SHED + DMEM + FBS + ASC + betaGLY + DEX; G5:MC3T3-E1 + alpha Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) + FBS + ASC + betaGLY. DNA content, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, free calcium quantification in the extracellular medium, and extracellular matrix mineralization quantification through staining with von Kossa, alizarin red, and tetracycline were performed on days 7 and 21. Osteogenic media supplemented with ASC and beta-GLY demonstrated similar effects on SHED in the presence or absence of DEX for DNA content (day 21) and capacity to mineralize the extracellular matrix according to alizarin red and tetracycline quantifications (day 21). In addition, the presence of DEX in the osteogenic medium promoted less ALP activity (day 7) and extracellular matrix mineralization according to the von Kossa assay (day 21), and more free calcium quantification at extracellular medium (day 21). In summary, the presence of DEX in the osteogenic media supplementation did not interfere with SHED commitment into mineral matrix depositor cells. We suggest that DEX may be omitted from culture media supplementation for SHED osteogenic differentiation in vitro studies.
33468149/Contemporary analysis of ETEST for antibiotic susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration agreement against Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis Objectives Cystic fibrosis (CF) acute pulmonary exacerbations are often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including multi-drug resistant strains. Optimal antibiotic therapy is required to return lung function and should be guided by in vitro susceptibility results. There are sparse data describing ETEST performance for CF isolates using contemporary isolates, methods and interpretation, as well as novel antibiotics, such as ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam. Methods Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 105) isolated during pulmonary exacerbation from patients with CF were acquired from 3 US hospitals. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were assessed by reference broth microdilution (BMD) and ETEST for aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tobramycin. Broth microdilution was conducted in concordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M100. ETEST methodology reflected package insert recommendations. Performance of ETEST strips was evaluated using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Susceptibility Testing Manufacturers Association (STMA) guidance. Results Of the 105 P. aeruginosa included, 46% had a mucoid phenotype. ETEST MICs typically read 0-1 dilution higher than BMD for all drugs. Categorical agreement and essential agreement ranged from 64 to 93% and 63 to 86%, respectively. The majority of observed errors were minor. A single very major error occurred with ceftazidime (4.2%). For ceftazidime-vibactam, 2 very major errors were observed and both were within essential agreement. Major errors occurred for aztreonam (3.3%), cefepime (9.4%), ceftazidime-avibactam (5.3%, adjusted 2.1%), ceftolozane-tazobactam (1%), meropenem (3.3%), piperacillin-tazobactam (2.9%), and tobramycin (1.5%). Conclusions ETEST methods performed conservatively for most antibiotics against this challenging collection of P. aeruginosa from patients with CF.
33468049/Exogenous application of xanthine and uric acid and nucleobase-ascorbate transporter MdNAT7 expression regulate salinity tolerance in apple Background Soil salinity is a critical threat to global agriculture. In plants, the accumulation of xanthine activates xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which catalyses the oxidation/conversion of xanthine to uric acid to remove excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). The nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) family is also known as the nucleobase-cation symporter (NCS) or AzgA-like family. NAT is known to transport xanthine and uric acid in plants. The expression of MdNAT is influenced by salinity stress in apple. Results In this study, we discovered that exogenous application of xanthine and uric acid enhanced the resistance of apple plants to salinity stress. In addition, MdNAT7 overexpression transgenic apple plants showed enhanced xanthine and uric acid concentrations and improved tolerance to salinity stress compared with nontransgenic plants, while opposite phenotypes were observed for MdNAT7 RNAi plants. These differences were probably due to the enhancement or impairment of ROS scavenging and ion homeostasis abilities. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that xanthine and uric acid have potential uses in salt stress alleviation, and MdNAT7 can be utilized as a candidate gene to engineer resistance to salt stress in plants.

33468136/Efficient whole-cell oxidation of alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohols to alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes through the cascade biocatalysis of alcohol dehydrogenase, NADPH oxidase and hemoglobin Background alpha,beta-Unsaturated aldehydes are widely used in the organic synthesis of fine chemicals for application in products such as flavoring agents, fragrances and pharmaceuticals. In the selective oxidation of alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohols to the corresponding alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes, it remains challenging to overcome poor selectivity, overoxidation and a low atom efficiency in chemical routes. Results An E. coli strain coexpressing the NADP+-specific alcohol dehydrogenase YsADH and the oxygen-dependent NADPH oxidase TkNOX was constructed; these components enabled the NADP+ regeneration and catalyzed the oxidation of 100 mM 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol to 3-methyl-2-butenal with a yield of 21.3%. The oxygen supply was strengthened by introducing the hemoglobin protein VsHGB into recombinant E. coli cells and replacing the atmosphere of the reactor with pure oxygen, which increased the yield to 51.3%. To further improve catalytic performance, the E. coli cells expressing the multifunctional fusion enzyme YsADH-(GSG)-TkNOX-(GSG)-VsHGB were generated, which completely converted 250 mM 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol to 3-methyl-2-butenal after 8 h of whole-cell oxidation. The reaction conditions for the cascade biocatalysis were optimized, in which supplementation with 0.2 mM FAD and 0.4 mM NADP+ was essential for maintaining high catalytic activity. Finally, the established whole-cell system could serve as a platform for the synthesis of valuable alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes through the selective oxidation of various alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohols. Conclusions The construction of a strain expressing the fusion enzyme YsADH-(GSG)-TkNOX-(GSG)-VsHGB achieved efficient NADP+ regeneration and the selective oxidation of various alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohols to the corresponding alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes. Among the available redox enzymes, the fusion enzyme YsADH-(GSG)-TkNOX-(GSG)-VsHGB has become the most recent successful example to improve catalytic performance in comparison with its separate components.
33468046/Comparative proteomic analysis of Nicotiana benthamiana plants under Chinese wheat mosaic virus infection Background Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) is a severe threat to winter wheat and is transmitted by Polymyxa graminis. The mechanisms of interactions between CWMV and plants are poorly understood. In this study, a comparative proteomics analysis based on nanoliquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS)/MS was conducted to characterize proteomic changes in plants responding to CWMV infection. Results In total, 2751 host proteins were identified, 1496 of which were quantified and 146 up-regulated and 244 down-regulated proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that DEPs were most strongly associated with photosynthesis antenna proteins, MAPK signaling plant and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways. Subcellular localization analysis predicted that more than half of the DEPs were localized in the chloroplast, an organelle indispensable for abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis. Our results suggest that CWMV infection interrupts normal chloroplast functions and decreases ABA concentrations in Nicotiana benthamiana. Further analysis showed that the ABA pathway was suppressed during CWMV infection and that ABA treatment induced plant hosts defenses against CWMV. Conclusions We identified several candidate proteins expressed during CWMV infection, and the ABA pathway was strongly associated with responses to CWMV infection in N. benthamiana.

33468087/The role of capecitabine-based neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background The role of capecitabine in neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly controversial. Our meta-analysis was designed to further elucidate the effects of capecitabine on survival in early-stage TNBC patients and its safety. Methods PubMed, Embase, and papers presented at several main conferences were searched up to December 19, 2019, to investigate capecitabine-based versus capecitabine-free neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 test, combined with hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed for disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and over grade 3 adverse events (AEs). Results A total of 9 randomized clinical trials and 3842 TNBC patients were included. Overall, the combined capecitabine regimens in neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly improved DFS (HR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.86; P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.77; P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, there were improvements in DFS in the groups with addition of capecitabine (HR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78; P < 0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.85; P < 0.001), and lymph node positivity (HR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.86; P = 0.005). Capecitabine regimens were related to higher risks of diarrhea (OR = 2.88, 95% CI 2.23-3.74, P < 0.001), stomatitis (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.53-2.64, P < 0.001) and hand-foot syndrome (OR = 8.67, 95% CI 6.70-11.22, P < 0.001). Conclusion This meta-analysis showed that neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy combined with capecitabine significantly improved both DFS and OS in early-stage TNBC patients with tolerable AEs. There were benefits to DFS in the groups with the addition of capecitabine, adjuvant chemotherapy, and lymph node positivity.

33468084/Comparative analysis of patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma in black-foot disease endemic and non-endemic area Background A high incidence of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma has been reported in the southwestern area of Taiwan, where arsenic water contamination was considered the main cause. However, there is no definite proof to show a correlation between arsenic water contamination and upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. To investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma between arsenic water endemic and non-endemic areas, we analyzed patients in terms of characteristics, stratified overall survival, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival. Methods The records of a total of 1194 patients diagnosed with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data and current medical status were collected from the medical records. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical variables and stratified survival curves between endemic and non-endemic groups. Results Female predominance was revealed in both endemic and non-endemic groups (male:female ratio = 1:1.2-1.4). No statistical differences were found in histological types, staging, and tumor size between the two groups. Nonetheless, patients with characteristics of aging and having end-stage renal disease were outnumbered in the non-endemic group, while a higher prevalence of previous bladder tumors and more ureteral tumors were found in the endemic group. Adjusted stratified cumulative survival curves suggested a poorer prognosis in endemic patients, especially in disease-free survival of early stage disease. Conclusions A higher mortality rate with more previous bladder cancer history and ureteral tumors was seen in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma residing in the arsenic water contamination area. This may be attributed to the long-term carcinogenic effect of arsenic underground water.
33520087/Berbamine Suppresses the Progression of Bladder Cancer by Modulating the ROS/NF-kappaB Axis Berbamine (BBM), one of the bioactive ingredients extracted from Berberis plants, has attracted intensive attention because of its significant antitumor activity against various malignancies. However, the exact role and potential molecular mechanism of berbamine in bladder cancer (BCa) remain unclear. In the present study, our results showed that berbamine inhibited cell viability, colony formation, and proliferation. Additionally, berbamine induced cell cycle arrest at S phase by a synergistic mechanism involving stimulation of P21 and P27 protein expression as well as downregulation of CyclinD, CyclinA2, and CDK2 protein expression. In addition to suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), berbamine rearranged the cytoskeleton to inhibit cell metastasis. Mechanistically, the expression of P65, P-P65, and P-IkappaBalpha was decreased upon berbamine treatment, yet P65 overexpression abrogated the effects of berbamine on the proliferative and metastatic potential of BCa cells, which indicated that berbamine attenuated the malignant biological activities of BCa cells by inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway. More importantly, berbamine increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level through the downregulation of antioxidative genes such as Nrf2, HO-1, SOD2, and GPX-1. Following ROS accumulation, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was triggered by an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Furthermore, berbamine-mediated ROS accumulation negatively regulated the NF-kappaB pathway to a certain degree. Consistent with our in vitro results, berbamine successfully inhibited tumor growth and blocked the NF-kappaB pathway in our xenograft model. To summarize, our data demonstrated that berbamine exerts antitumor effects via the ROS/NF-kappaB signaling axis in bladder cancer, which provides a basis for further comprehensive study and presents a potential candidate for clinical treatment strategies against bladder cancer.
33520086/ Polygonatum sibiricum Polysaccharides Protect against MPP-Induced Neurotoxicity via the Akt/mTOR and Nrf2 Pathways  Polygonatum sibiricum, a well-known life-prolonging tonic in Chinese medicine, has been widely used for nourishing nerves in the orient, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that P. sibiricum polysaccharides (PSP) ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2.3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced locomotor activity deficiency and dopaminergic neuronal loss in an in vivo Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model. Additionally, PSP pretreatment inhibited N-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+) induced the production of reactive oxygen species, increasing the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione. In vitro experiments showed that PSP promoted the proliferation of N2a cells in a dose-dependent manner, while exhibiting effects against oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis elicited by MPP+. These effects were found to be associated with the activation of Akt/mTOR-mediated p70S6K and 4E-BP1 signaling pathways, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2- (Nrf2-) mediated NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (Gclm), resulting in antiapoptotic and antioxidative effects. Meanwhile, PSP exhibited no chronic toxicity in C57BJ/6 mice. Together, our results suggest that PSP can serve as a promising therapeutic candidate with neuroprotective properties in preventing PD.
33471227/Tribological, biocompatibility, and antibiofilm properties of tungsten-germanium coating using magnetron sputtering In this study, borosilicate glass and 316 L stainless steel were coated with germanium (Ge) and tungsten (W) metals using the Magnetron Sputtering System. Surface structural, mechanical, and tribological properties of uncoated and coated samples were examined using SEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and tribometer. The XRD results showed that WGe2 chemical compound observed in (110) crystalline phase and exhibited a dense structure. According to the tribological analyses, the adhesion strength of the coated deposition on 316 L was obtained 32.8 N, and the mean coefficient of friction was around 0.3. Biocompatibility studies of coated metallic biomaterials were analyzed on fibroblast cell culture (Primary Dermal Fibroblast; Normal, Human, Adult (HDFa)) in vitro. Hoescht 33258 fluorescent staining was performed to investigate the cellular density and chromosomal abnormalities of the HDFa cell line on the borosilicate glasses coated with germanium-tungsten (W-Ge). Cell viabilities of HDFa cell line on each surface (W-Ge coated borosilicate glass, uncoated borosilicate glass, and cell culture plate surface) were analyzed by using (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cytotoxicity assay. The antibiofilm activity of W-Ge coated borosilicate glass showed a significant reduction effect on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) adherence compared to control groups. In the light of findings, tungsten and germanium, which are some of the most common industrial materials, were investigated as biocompatible and antimicrobial surface coatings and recommended as bio-implant materials for the first time.
33471210/An alginate-PHMB-AgNPs based wound dressing polyamide nanocomposite with improved antibacterial and hemostatic properties Wound dressing should be impenetrable against microorganisms and it should keep the wound wet. Gauze and polyamide (PA) substrate were treated with various concentrations of AgNPs (25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm), PHMB (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1% w/v), and constant concentration of alginate (0.5% W/V) using a simple dipping method. Prepared samples were characterized by various techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the particles were successfully applied onto both substrates with an average diameter of particle size of 78 nm on gauze and 172 nm on the PA substrate surface (based on 50 nanoparticles). Antibacterial activity of the prepared nanocomposite against Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) bacteria on PA substrate and gauze were evaluated using the disc diffusion method. The results indicated that the prepared nanocomposites offer favorable antibacterial properties and bacteria would not grow in culture media. The water uptake capacity test of the treated samples was assessed and the data demonstrated that the water absorption rate significantly increases on both treated substrates (gauze and PA substrate) due to the presence of alginate polymer. Also, observing the results of the coagulation test showed that treated samples caused blood clots on the dressing. This is due to the presence of alginate polymer. The present work demonstrates that the prepared samples offer excellent antibacterial properties and good water uptake capacity that capable of being a potential candidate for wound dressings. Due to the results, the produced PA substrate could be an appropriate replacement for the cotton gauze as a wound dressing.
33471255/Sol-gel based synthesis and biological properties of zinc integrated nano bioglass ceramics for bone tissue regeneration Bone is a flexible and electro active tissue that is vulnerable to various traumatic injuries. The self-healing of damaged bone tissue towards reconstruction is limited due to the lack of proper niche compliances. Nevertheless, the classical grafting techniques like autograft/allograft for bone repair pose challenges like bacterial infections and donor-site morbidity with unsatisfactory outcomes. The use of appropriate biomaterial with osteogenic potential can meet these challenges. In this regard, bioactive glass ceramics is widely used as a bone filler or graft material because of its bonding affinity to bone leading towards bone reconstruction applications without the challenge of post implant infections. Hence, the current study is aimed at addressing this potentiality of zinc (Zn) for doped the bioglass at nano-scale advantages for bone tissue repair. Since, Zn has been demonstrated to have not only antibacterial property but also the stimulatory effect on osteoblasts differentiation, mineralization by enhancing the osteogenic genes expression. In view of these, the present study is focused on sol-gel synthesis and pysico-chemical characterization of Zinc-doped bioglass nanoparticles (Zn-nBGC) and also analyzing its biological implications. The surface morphological and physiochemical characterizations using SEM, EDX, FT-IR and XRD analysis has shown the increased surface area of Zn-nBGC particles providing a great platform for biomolecular interaction, cytocompatibility, cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. The obtaining hydroxy apatite groups have initiated in vitro mineralization towards osteogenic lineage formation. Zn has not only involved in enhancing cellular actions but also strengthen the ceramic nanoparticles towards antibacterial application. Hence the finding suggests a biomaterial synthesis of better biomaterial for bone tissue engineering application by preventing post-operative bacterial infection.
33478380/Heterologous expression of Arabidopsis thaliana rty gene in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) improves drought tolerance Background Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) is an important fruit crop worldwide. It was particularly sensitive to drought stress because of their fibrous and shallow root systems. Mutant rty of Arabidopsis thaliana ROOTY (RTY) results in increased endogenous auxin levels, more roots, and shoot growth. It is still unclear whether the rty gene improves stress tolerance in strawberry. Results rty gene was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in the pBI121-rty binary vector carrying the selectable marker of neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II). Seven transgenic lines were confirmed by PCR and western blot analysis. Accumulations of IAA and ABA were significantly increased in the transgenic plants. The endogenous IAA contents were 46.5 ng g- 1 and 66.0 ng g- 1in control and transgenic plants respectively. The endogenous ABA contents in the control plant were 236.3 ng g- 1 and in transgenic plants were 543.8 ng g- 1. The production of adventitious roots and trichomes were enhanced in the transgenic plants. Furthermore, transcript levels of the genes including IAA and ABA biosynthetic, and stress-responsive genes, were higher in the transgenic plants than in the control plants under drought conditions. Water use efficiency and a reduced water loss rate were enhanced in the transgenic strawberry plants. Additionally, peroxidase and catalase activities were significantly higher in the transgenic plants than in the control plants. The experiment results revealed a novel function for rty related to ABA and drought responses. Conclusions The rty gene improved hormone-mediated drought tolerance in transgenic strawberry. The heterologous expression of rty in strawberry improved drought tolerance by promoting auxin and ABA accumulation. These phytohormones together brought about various physiological changes that improved drought tolerance via increased root production, trichome density, and stomatal closure. Our results suggested that a transgenic approach can be used to overcome the inherent trade-off between plant growth and drought tolerance by enhancing water use efficiency and reducing water loss rate under water shortage conditions.

33478482/Efficacy of a curcumin extract (Curcugen ) on gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal microbiota in adults with self-reported digestive complaints: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study Background There is preliminary evidence to suggest curcumin can alleviate digestive symptoms in adults with self-reported digestive complaints and irritable bowel syndrome. However, in all these trials, curcumin was used as a component of a multi-herbal combination and there were consistent concerns associated with risk of bias in most studies. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of a curcumin extract (Curcugen ) on gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, and overall quality of life in adults presenting with self-reported digestive complaints. Moreover, to determine the potential therapeutic mechanisms of action associated with curcumin, its effects on intestinal microbiota and small intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) were examined. Methods In this 8-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 79 adults with self-reported digestive complaints were recruited and randomised to receive either a placebo or 500 mg of the curcumin extract, Curcugen . Outcome measures included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), intestinal microbial profile (16S rRNA), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and SIBO breath test. Results Based on self-report data collected from 77 participants, curcumin was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the GSRS total score compared to the placebo. There was also a greater reduction in the DASS-21 anxiety score. No other significant between-group changes in self-report data were identified. An examination of changes in the intestinal microbial profile and SIBO test revealed curcumin had no significant effect on these parameters. Curcumin was well-tolerated with no significant adverse events. Conclusions The curcumin extract, Curcugen , administered for 8 weeks at a dose of 500 mg once daily was associated with greater improvements in digestive complaints and anxiety levels in adults with self-reported digestive complaints. Compared to the placebo, there were no significant changes in intestinal microbiota or SIBO; however, further research using larger samples and testing methods that allow more detailed microbial analyses will be important.

33478498/Anti-inflammatory effect of different curcumin preparations on adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats Background Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic substance, has been known for more than two millennia as having strong anti-inflammatory activity towards multiple ailments, including arthritis. The main drawback of curcumin is its poor solubility in water, which leads to low intestinal absorption and minimal bioavailability. In this study, we aimed to compare the anti-arthritic in vivo effect of different curcumin preparations - basic curcumin extract, micellar curcumin, curcumin mixture with piperine, and microencapsulated curcumin. Methods Arthritis was induced in Wistar rats by complete Freund's adjuvant, and the severity of arthritis was evaluated daily using the arthritis score system. Curcumin preparations were given to animals per os daily for 20 consecutive days, starting at 6th day after arthritis induction. To determine the inflammatory background, pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined using the ELISA test. In addition, hematologic test, weight change, and limb swelling were tracked. Results Our results indicate that curcumin had a rather weak effect on arthritis progression in the Wistar rat model, microencapsulated curcumin effectively prevented the progression of arthritis - the disease stabilized after 10 days of supplementation. It also reduced the levels of immune cells (neutrophils and leukocytes), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNFalpha, IL-1, and IL-6, which levels were close to arthritis-free control. Other formulations of curcumin had lower or no effect on arthritis progression. Conclusion Our study shows that the same concentrations of curcumin had a distinctly expressed positive anti-inflammatory effect depending on the form of its delivery. Specifically, we found that microencapsulated curcumin had the most promising effect for treatment.

33478522/Short-term co-ingestion of creatine and sodium bicarbonate improves anaerobic performance in trained taekwondo athletes Background Creatine (CR) and sodium bicarbonate (SB) alone improve anaerobic performance. However, the ergogenic effects of CR and SB co-ingestion on taekwondo anaerobic performance remains unknown. Methods Forty trained taekwondo athletes (21 +- 1 y.; 180.5 +- 7.3 cm; 72.7 +- 8.6 kg) were randomized to: (i) CR and SB (CR + SB; 20 g of CR+ 0.5 g kg- 1 d- 1 of SB), (ii) CR, (iii) SB, (iv) placebo (PLA), or (v) control (CON) for 5 days. Before and after supplementation, participants completed 3 bouts of a Taekwondo Anaerobic Intermittent Kick Test (TAIKT) to determine changes in peak power (PP), mean power (MP), and fatigue index (FI). Blood lactate (BL) was measured before, immediately following, and 3 min post-TAIKT. Results PP and MP increased over time (P < 0.05) following CR + SB, CR, and SB ingestion, with no changes in the PLA or CON groups. There was a greater increase over time in MP following CR + SB (Absolute Delta: 1.15 +- 0.28 W kg67) compared to CR (Absolute Delta: 0.43 +- 0.33 W kg67; P < 0.001) and SB (Absolute Delta: 0.73 +- 0.24 W kg67; P = 0.03). There were no significant time and condition effect for FI (P > 0.05). BL increased following exercise across all groups; however, CR + SB and SB post-exercise BL was lower compared to CR, PLA, and CON (P < 0.05). Conclusion Short-term CR and SB alone enhance TAIKT performance in trained taekwondo athletes. Co-ingestion of CR and SB augments MP compared to CR and SB alone, with similar PP improvements. 
33475850/Long-term in vitro degradation and in vivo evaluation of resorbable bioceramics An essential criterion for the selection of resorbable bioceramics is their ability to degrade inside human body within a reasonable time frame. Furthermore, if the bioceramic can release beneficial ions, such as strontium, as it degrades, recovery time might be shortened. The present study demonstrates that strontium-containing calcium sulfate (Sr,Ca)SO4 can fulfill these criteria. A long-term in vitro degradation analysis for 12 weeks using sintered (Sr,Ca)SO4 discs in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) was conducted. The sintered (Sr,Ca)SO4 disc was then implanted into defects in the distal femur of rats. The degradation rate of (Sr,Ca)SO4 discs showed a strong dependence on the Sr content. Similar results were observed between the long-term in vitro degradation analysis and the in vivo evaluation. The sintered (3.8%Sr,Ca)SO4 disc lost more than 80% of its initial weight after soaking in PBS with shaking at 37  C for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks in vivo, the remaining volume of the (3.8%Sr,Ca)SO4 disc within the bone defect was ~25%. Over the same time period, new bone was formed at a relative volume of 40%. This study demonstrates the potential of (Sr,Ca)SO4 bioceramic, and the benefits of using a long-term degradation test during the evaluation of resorbable bioceramics.
33482812/Engineering Escherichia coli for the utilization of ethylene glycol Background A considerable challenge in the development of bioprocesses for producing chemicals and fuels has been the high cost of feedstocks relative to oil prices, making it difficult for these processes to compete with their conventional petrochemical counterparts. Hence, in the absence of high oil prices in the near future, there has been a shift in the industry to produce higher value compounds such as fragrances for cosmetics. Yet, there is still a need to address climate change and develop biotechnological approaches for producing large market, lower value chemicals and fuels. Results In this work, we study ethylene glycol (EG), a novel feedstock that we believe has promise to address this challenge. We engineer Escherichia coli (E. coli) to consume EG and examine glycolate production as a case study for chemical production. Using a combination of modeling and experimental studies, we identify oxygen concentration as an important metabolic valve in the assimilation and use of EG as a substrate. Two oxygen-based strategies are thus developed and tested in fed-batch bioreactors. Ultimately, the best glycolate production strategy employed a target respiratory quotient leading to the highest observed fermentation performance. With this strategy, a glycolate titer of 10.4 g/L was reached after 112 h of production time in a fed-batch bioreactor. Correspondingly, a yield of 0.8 g/g from EG and productivity of 0.1 g/L h were measured during the production stage. Our modeling and experimental results clearly suggest that oxygen concentration is an important factor in the assimilation and use of EG as a substrate. Finally, our use of metabolic modeling also sheds light on the intracellular distribution through central metabolism, implicating flux to 2-phosphoglycerate as the primary route for EG assimilation. Conclusion Overall, our work suggests that EG could provide a renewable starting material for commercial biosynthesis of fuels and chemicals that may achieve economic parity with petrochemical feedstocks while sequestering carbon dioxide.
33482833/Brewers' spent grain as substrate for dextran biosynthesis by Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM20193 and Weissella confusa A16 Background Lactic acid bacteria can synthesize dextran and oligosaccharides with different functionality, depending on the strain and fermentation conditions. As natural structure-forming agent, dextran has proven useful as food additive, improving the properties of several raw materials with poor technological quality, such as cereal by-products, fiber-and protein-rich matrices, enabling their use in food applications. In this study, we assessed dextran biosynthesis in situ during fermentation of brewers  spent grain (BSG), the main by-product of beer brewing industry, with Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM20193 and Weissella confusa A16. The starters performance and the primary metabolites formed during 24 h of fermentation with and without 4% sucrose (w/w) were followed. Results The starters showed similar growth and acidification kinetics, but different sugar utilization, especially in presence of sucrose. Viscosity increase in fermented BSG containing sucrose occurred first after 10 h, and it kept increasing until 24 h concomitantly with dextran formation. Dextran content after 24 h was approximately 1% on the total weight of the BSG. Oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization were formed together with dextran from 10 to 24 h. Three dextransucrase genes were identified in L. pseudomesenteroides DSM20193, one of which was significantly upregulated and remained active throughout the fermentation time. One dextransucrase gene was identified in W. confusa A16 also showing a typical induction profile, with highest upregulation at 10 h. Conclusions Selected lactic acid bacteria starters produced significant amount of dextran in brewers' spent grain while forming oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization. Putative dextransucrase genes identified in the starters showed a typical induction profile. Formation of dextran and oligosaccharides in BSG during lactic acid bacteria fermentation can be tailored to achieve specific technological properties of this raw material, contributing to its reintegration into the food chain.
33481851/Individual differences in rat sensitivity to CO2 Feelings of fear, anxiety, dyspnea and panic when inhaling carbon dioxide (CO2) are variable among humans, in part due to differences in CO2 sensitivity. Rat aversion to CO2 consistently varies between individuals; this variation in aversion may reflect CO2 sensitivity, but other personality traits could also account for individual differences in aversion. The aims of this study were to 1) assess the stability of individual differences in rat aversion to CO2, 2) determine if individual differences in sweet reward motivation are associated with variation in aversion to CO2, and 3) assess whether variation in aversion to CO2 is related to individual differences in motivation to approach gains (promotion focus) or maintain safety (prevention focus). Twelve female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed multiple times at three different ages (3, 9 and 16 months old) to CO2 in approach-avoidance testing to assess motivation to avoid CO2 against motivation to gain sweet rewards. Rats were also tested for motivation to find hidden sweet rewards, and for their motivation to approach rewards or darkness. Tolerance to CO2 increased with repeated exposures and was higher at older ages. Individual differences in aversion to CO2 were highly repeatable but unrelated to motivation for sweet rewards or the strength of promotion and prevention focus. These results indicate that individual differences in aversion to CO2 reflect variation in CO2 sensitivity.
33481815/Integrated transcriptome, small RNA and degradome sequencing approaches proffer insights into chlorogenic acid biosynthesis in leafy sweet potato Leafy sweet potato is rich in total phenolics (TP) which play key roles in health protection, the chlorogenic acid (CGA) constitutes the major components of phenolic compounds in leafy sweet potato. Unfortunately, the mechanism of CGA biosynthesis in leafy sweet potato is unclear. To dissect the mechanisms of CGA biosynthesis, we performed transcriptome, small RNA (sRNA) and degradome sequencing of one low-CGA content and one high-CGA content genotype at two stages. A total of 2,333 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and the enriched DEGs were related to photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The functional genes, such as CCR, CCoAOMT and HCT in the CGA biosynthetic pathway were down-regulated, indicating that the way to lignin was altered, and two possible CGA biosynthetic routes were hypothesized. A total of 38 DE miRNAs were identified, and 1,799 targets were predicated for 38 DE miRNAs by using in silico approaches. The target genes were enriched in lignin and phenylpropanoid catabolic processes. Transcription factors (TFs) such as apetala2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) and Squamosa promoter binding protein-like (SPL) predicated in silico were validated by degradome sequencing. Association analysis of the DE miRNAs and transcriptome datasets identified that miR156 family negatively targeted AP2/ERF and SPL. Six mRNAs and six miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the expression levels of the mRNAs and miRNAs were consistent with the sequencing data. This study established comprehensive functional genomic resources for the CGA biosynthesis, and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms involving in this process. The results also enabled the first perceptions of the regulatory roles of mRNAs and miRNAs, and offered candidate genes for leafy sweet potato improvements.
33481792/Real-time monitoring of extracellular ATP in bacterial cultures using thermostable luciferase Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the most important indicators of cell viability. Extracellular ATP (eATP) is commonly detected in cultures of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells but is not the focus of current scientific research. Although ATP release has traditionally been considered to mainly occur as a consequence of cell destruction, current evidence indicates that ATP leakage also occurs during the growth phase of diverse bacterial species and may play an important role in bacterial physiology. ATP can be conveniently measured with high sensitivity in luciferase-based bioluminescence assays. However, wild-type luciferases suffer from low stability, which limit their use. Here we demonstrate that an engineered, thermostable luciferase is suitable for real-time monitoring of ATP release by bacteria, both in broth culture and on agar surfaces. Different bacterial species show distinct patterns of eATP accumulation and decline. Real-time monitoring of eATP allows for the estimation of viable cell number by relating luminescence onset time to initial cell concentration. Furthermore, the method is able to rapidly detect the effect of antibiotics on bacterial cultures as Ampicillin sensitive strains challenged with beta lactam antibiotics showed strongly increased accumulation of eATP even in the absence of growth, as determined by optical density. Patterns of eATP determined by real-time luminescence measurement could be used to infer the minimal inhibitory concentration of Ampicillin. Compared to conventional antibiotic susceptibility testing, the method presented here is faster and more sensitive, which is essential for better treatment outcomes and reducing the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance. Real-time eATP bioluminescence assays are suitable for different cell types, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, thus, permitting their application in diverse fields of research. It can be used for example in the study of the role of eATP in physiology and pathophysiology, for monitoring microbial contamination or for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical diagnostics.
33481866/A randomized, open-label, parallel, multi-center Phase IV study to compare the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg in high-risk Asian patients with hypercholesterolemia Background Although accumulating evidence suggests a more extensive reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), it is unclear whether a higher statin dose is more effective and cost-effective in the Asian population. This study compared the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin 20 and 10 mg in high-risk Asian patients with hypercholesterolemia. Methods A 12-week, open-label, parallel, multicenter, Phase IV randomized controlled trial was conducted at ten hospitals in the Republic of Korea between October 2017 and May 2019. High-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia, defined according to 2015 Korean guidelines for dyslipidemia management, were eligible to participate. We randomly assigned 250 patients at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to receive 20 mg (n = 124) or 10 mg (n = 126) of atorvastatin. The primary endpoint was the difference in the mean percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline after 12 weeks. Cost-effectiveness was measured as an exploratory endpoint. Results LDL-C levels were reduced more significantly by atorvastatin 20 mg than by 10 mg after 12 weeks (42.4% vs. 33.5%, p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients achieved target LDL-C levels (<100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, <70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients) with atorvastatin 20 mg than with 10 mg (40.3% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.05). Apolipoprotein B decreased significantly with atorvastatin 20mg versus 10 mg (-36.2% vs. -29.9%, p < 0.05). Lipid ratios also showed greater improvement with atorvastatin 20 mg than with 10 mg (total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, -33.3% vs. -29.4%, p < 0.05; apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio, -36.7% vs. -31.4%, p < 0.05). Atorvastatin 20 mg was more cost-effective than atorvastatin 10 mg in terms of both the average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Safety and tolerability of atorvastatin 20 mg were comparable to those of atorvastatin 10 mg. Conclusion In high-risk Asian patients with hypercholesterolemia, atorvastatin 20 mg was both efficacious in reducing LDL-C and cost-effective compared with atorvastatin 10 mg.
33374662/Prevalence and Impact of Vitamin D Deficiency in Critically Ill Cancer Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit Vitamin D deficiency is frequent in cancer patients and a risk factor for morbidity and mortality during critical illness. This single-center retrospective study analyzed 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in critically ill cancer patients (n = 178; hematologic, n = 108; solid, n = 70) enrolled in a prospective ICU registry. The primary analysis was the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and the severe deficiency (<=12 ng/mL). Secondary analyses included risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and its impact on ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and severe deficiency was 74% (95% CI: 67-80%) and 54% (95% CI: 47-61%). Younger age, relapsed/refractory disease, and a higher sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency (p < 0.05). After adjusting for relapsed/refractory disease, infection, the SOFA score, and the early need for life-supporting interventions, severe vitamin D deficiency was an independent predictor of hospital mortality (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.03-4.72, p = 0.04) and 1-year mortality (OR: 3.40, 95% CI: 1.50-7.71, p < 0.01), but not of ICU mortality. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill cancer patients requiring ICU admission, but its impact on short-term mortality in this group is uncertain. The observed association of severe vitamin D deficiency with the post-ICU outcome warrants clinical consideration and further study.
33374667/Maternal Dietary Selenium Intake during Pregnancy Is Associated with Higher Birth Weight and Lower Risk of Small for Gestational Age Births in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study Selenium is an essential trace element involved in the body's redox reactions. Low selenium intake during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight and an increased risk of children being born small for gestational age (SGA). Based on data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), we studied the association of maternal selenium intake from diet and supplements during the first half of pregnancy (n = 71,728 women) and selenium status in mid-pregnancy (n = 2628 women) with birth weight and SGA status, according to population-based, ultrasound-based and customized growth standards. An increase of one standard deviation of maternal dietary selenium intake was associated with increased birth weight z-scores (ss = 0.027, 95% CI: 0.007, 0.041) and lower SGA risk (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.86, 0.97) after adjusting for confounders. Maternal organic and inorganic selenium intake from supplements as well as whole blood selenium concentration were not associated with birth weight or SGA. Our results suggest that a maternal diet rich in selenium during pregnancy may be beneficial for foetal growth. However, the effect estimates were small and further studies are needed to elucidate the potential impact of selenium on foetal growth.
33374554/Calorie-Restricted Mediterranean and Low-Fat Diets Affect Fatty Acid Status in Individuals with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Lifestyle modifications are the main support of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapy. Weight loss is one of the primary goals in NAFLD, but the effects of different calorie-restricted diets remain unclear. Thus, we evaluated the effects of two calorie-restricted diets:the Mediterranean diet (Med diet) and low-fat diet:on liver status, cardiometabolic markers, and fatty acid profiles in patients with NAFLD. Twenty-four overweight/moderately obese men were randomly assigned to consume one of these diets. Lipid levels, glucose, insulin, liver enzymes, steatosis, and fatty acid profiles of serum and erythrocytes phospholipids were assessed. After 3 months, all participants had a significant weight loss (>9%), with improvements in waist circumference, body fat %, index of visceral adiposity (VAI), lipid accumulation product, fatty liver (FLI), and hepatic steatosis (HSI) index (p < 0.001). Both diets significantly lowered triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol, liver enzymes, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index. Fatty acid profiles were enhanced after both diets, with a significantly decreased n-6/n-3 ratio. Participants on the Med diet had higher levels of HDL-cholesterol and monounsaturated and n-3 docosahexaenoic acids in serum phospholipids and lower levels of saturated fatty acids, triglycerides, TG/HDL ratio, and FLI when compared to participants on the low-fat diet. Our results indicate that dietary patterns and calorie restriction represent central therapeutic issues in the improvement of obesity-related cardiometabolic alterations that are involved in the mechanism of hepatic steatosis. The Med diet may contribute to disease treatment even more than the low-fat diet since it leads to decreased saturated and increased monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid status and improved FLI in NAFLD patients.
33374696/An Examination of Serum Acylcarnitine and Amino Acid Profiles at Different Time Point of Ketogenic Diet Therapy and Their Association of Ketogenic Diet Effectiveness Background: This study aimed to identify metabolic parameters at different time points of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) and investigate their association with response to KDT in pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Methods: Prospectively, twenty-nine patients (0.67~20 years old) with DRE received classic ketogenic diet with non-fasting, gradual KD initiation protocol (GRAD-KD) for 1 year were enrolled. A total of 22 patients remaining in study received blood examinations at baseline, 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th months of KDT. beta-hydroxybutyrate, free carnitine, acylcarnitines, and amino acids were compared between responders (seizure reduction rate >= 50%) and non-responders (seizure reduction rate < 50%) to identify the effectiveness of KDT. Results: The 12-month retention rate was 76%. The responders after 12 months of KDT were 59% (13/22). The free carnitine level decreased significantly at 9th months (p < 0.001) but increased toward baseline without symptoms. Propionyl carnitine (C3), Isovaleryl carnitine (C5), 3-Hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5:OH) and methylmalonyl carnitine (C4-DC) decreased but 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4:OH) increased significantly at 12th months of KDT. The glycine level was persistently higher than baseline after KDT. KDT responders had lower baseline C3 and long-chain acylcarnitines, C14 and C18, as well as lower C5, C18, and leucine/isoleucine. Conclusions: KDT should be avoided in patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemia. Routine carnitine supplementation is not recommended because hypocarnitinemia was transient and asymptomatic during KDT. Better mitochondrial betaoxidation function associates with greater KDT response.
33510583/Activation of Opioid Receptors Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Skeletal Muscle Induced by Tourniquet Placement Method  Mice were randomly assigned to the sham, I/R, Oxy, and I/R with Oxy groups. Oxy was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before tourniquet placement. Morphological changes of the gastrocnemius muscle in these mice were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and electron microscopy. Expression levels of TLR4, NF-kappaB, SIRT1, and PGC-1alpha in the skeletal muscles were detected by western blot. Blood TNF-alpha levels, gastrocnemius muscle contractile force, and ATP concentration were examined.  Results  Compared with the I/R group, Oxy pretreatment attenuated skeletal muscle damage, decreased serum TNF-alpha levels, and inhibited the expression levels of TLR4/NF-kappaB in the gastrocnemius muscle. Furthermore, Oxy treatment significantly increased serum ATP levels and the contractility of the skeletal muscles. SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha levels were significantly reduced in gastrocnemius muscle after I/R. Oxy pretreatment recovered these protein expression levels.  Conclusion  Tourniquet-induced acute limb I/R results in morphological and functional impairment in skeletal muscle. Pretreatment with Oxy attenuates skeletal muscle from acute I/R injury through inhibition of TLR4/NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory response and protects SIRT1/PGC-1alpha-dependent mitochondrial function.
33510837/Ehretiquinone from Onosma bracteatum Wall Exhibits Antiaging Effect on Yeasts and Mammals through Antioxidative Stress and Autophagy Induction The antiaging benzoquinone-type molecule ehretiquinone was isolated in a previous study as a leading compound from the herbal medicine Onosma bracteatum wall. This paper reports the antiaging effect and mechanism of ehretiquinone by using yeasts, mammal cells, and mice. Ehretiquinone extends not only the replicative lifespan but also the chronological lifespan of yeast and the yeast-like chronological lifespan of mammal cells. Moreover, ehretiquinone increases glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activity and reduces reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, contributing to the lifespan extension of the yeasts. Furthermore, ehretiquinone does not extend the replicative lifespan of Deltasod1, Deltasod2, Deltauth1, Deltaskn7, Deltagpx, Deltacat, Deltaatg2, and Deltaatg32 mutants of yeast. Crucially, ehretiquinone induces autophagy in yeasts and mice, thereby providing significant evidence on the antiaging effects of the molecule in the mammalian level. Concomitantly, the silent information regulator 2 gene, which is known for its contributions in prolonging replicative lifespan, was confirmed to be involved in the chronological lifespan of yeasts and participates in the antiaging activity of ehretiquinone. These findings suggest that ehretiquinone shows an antiaging effect through antioxidative stress, autophagy, and histone deacetylase Sir2 regulation. Therefore, ehretiquinone is a promising molecule that could be developed as an antiaging drug or healthcare product.
33510839/D-Limonene Alleviates Acute Kidney Injury Following Gentamicin Administration in Rats: Role of NF-kappaB Pathway, Mitochondrial Apoptosis, Oxidative Stress, and PCNA Clinical application of gentamicin (GM) is well known to be associated with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study was the first to investigate the possible protective effects of D-limonene (D-lim) on AKI following GM administration in rats. 32 rats arranged in four groups (n = 8): (1) the control group received saline intraperitoneally (0.5 ml/day) and orally (0.5 ml/day), (2) the D-lim group received D-lim (100 mg/kg) orally and saline (0.5 ml/day) intraperitoneally, (3) the GM group received GM (100 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally and saline (0.5 ml/day) orally, and (4) the treated group received intraperitoneal GM (100 mg/kg) and oral D-lim (100 mg/kg). All treatments were performed daily for 12 consecutive days. Results revealed that D-lim ameliorated GM-induced AKI, oxidative stress, mitochondrial apoptosis, and inflammation. D-lim showed nephroprotective effects as reflected by the decrease in serum urea and creatinine and improvement of renal histopathological changes. D-lim alleviated GM-induced oxidative stress by increasing the activities of renal catalase, serum and renal glutathione peroxidase, and renal superoxide dismutase and decreasing renal malondialdehyde and serum nitric oxide levels. Intriguingly, D-lim suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis by considerably downregulating Bax and caspase-3 (Casp-3) mRNA and protein expressions and markedly enhancing Bcl2 mRNA and protein expressions. Furthermore, D-lim significantly decreases GM-induced inflammatory response through downregulation of NF-kappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA and/or protein expressions and decrease in renal myeloperoxidase activity. Finally, D-lim remarkably downregulated PCNA protein expression in the treated group compared with the GM group. In brief, this study showed that D-lim alleviated AKI following GM administration in rats, partially through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities as well as downregulation of PCNA expression.
33510844/Phloroglucinol Strengthens the Antioxidant Barrier and Reduces Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most commonly occurring diseases within western dietary patterns. Usually untreated, it may lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Besides its severe aftermath, up to now, there is no known therapeutic approach to this disease in everyday clinical practice. Most NAFLD patients are encouraged to do physical activities or diet change and remain without pharmacological treatment. In this study, we present phloroglucinol (PHG) as a novel and promising compound in NAFLD treatment. PHG significantly increased the level of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants both in palmitate and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress models. Strengthened antioxidative defense reduced the oxidative/nitrosative damage to cell proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, PHG treatment reduced hepatic steatosis; lowered inflammatory markers, such as NF-kappaB or HIF-1alpha; and inhibited cell apoptosis. Moreover, PHG had a more comprehensive effect than other commonly used antioxidants: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), suggesting its clinical usability. Therefore, our paper supports the benefits of natural compounds as a therapeutical approach to NAFLD.
33383956/Prophylactic Treatment with Vitamins C and B2 for Methotrexate-Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis Mucositis is a common side-effect of chemotherapy treatment, inducing alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Redox active compounds, such as vitamins B2 and C, have been shown to reduce inflammation and enhance the growth of anaerobic bacteria in the gut. We therefore aimed to (1) validate the ability of these compounds to promote bacterial cell growth in vitro, and (2) determine their prophylactic efficacy in a rat model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis. Bacterial growth curves were performed to assess the growth kinetics of bacteria exposed to Vitamins C and B2 (0.5 mM). Male wistar rats (150-200 g) received vitamins B2 (12 mg/day) and C (50 mg/day) via daily oral gavage (from day -1 to day 10). MTX (45 mg/Kg) was administrated via I.V. injection (N = 4-8/group) on day 0. Body weight, water/food consumption and diarrhea were assessed daily. Blood and faecal samples were collected longitudinally to assess citrulline levels (mucositis biomarker) and gut microbiota composition. Vitamins C/B2 enhanced the in vitro growth of anaerobic bacteria Blautia coccoides and Roseburia intestinalis. Contrarily to vitamin B2, in vivo administration of Vitamin C significantly attenuated clinical symptoms of mucositis. Despite their influence on the composition of the gut microbiota, both vitamins did not modulate the course of MTX-induced mucositis, as accessed by plasma citrulline. Vitamins B2 and C enhanced anaerobic bacterial growth in vitro, however their ability to mitigate MTX-induced mucositis was limited.
33396905/Steviol Glycosides Supplementation Affects Lipid Metabolism in High-Fat Fed STZ-Induced Diabetic Rats A number of health-promoting properties of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni and its glycosides, including the antihyperglycemic activity, have been found. The mechanisms of the antidiabetic action of stevia have not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementary steviol glycosides on high-fat fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with particular attention to lipid metabolism. The experiment was conducted on 70 male Wistar rats, of which 60 were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, to induce type 2 diabetes. Afterwards, rats were divided into six groups and fed a high-fat diet supplemented with pure stevioside or rebaudioside A, at two levels (500 or 2500 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)) for 5 weeks. Three additional groups: diabetic untreated, diabetic treated with metformin, and healthy, served as respective controls. Blood and dissected internal organs were collected for hematological, biochemical, and histopathological tests. It was found that dietary supplementation with steviol glycosides did not affect blood glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance indices, antioxidant biomarkers, but normalized hyperlipidemia and affected the appetite, as well as attenuated blood liver and kidney function indices, and reduced tissular damage in diabetic rats. Steviol glycosides normalize lipid metabolism and attenuate internal organs damage in diabetes.
33375730/[6S]-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid and Folic Acid Pregnancy Diets Differentially Program Metabolic Phenotype and Hypothalamic Gene Expression of Wistar Rat Dams Post-Birth [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (MTHF) is a proposed replacement for folic acid (FA) in diets and prenatal supplements. This study compared the effects of these two forms on maternal metabolism and hypothalamic gene expression. Pregnant Wistar rats received an AIN-93G diet with recommended FA (1X, 2 mg/kg, control), 5X-FA or equimolar levels of MTHF. During lactation they received the control diet and then a high fat diet for 19-weeks post-weaning. Body weight, adiposity, food intake, energy expenditure, plasma hormones, folate, and 1-carbon metabolites were measured. RNA-sequencing of the hypothalamus was conducted at parturition. Weight-loss from weaning to 1-week post-weaning was less in dams fed either form of the 5X vs. 1X folate diets, but final weight-gain was higher in 5X-MTHF vs. 5X-FA dams. Both doses of the MTHF diets led to 8% higher food intake and associated with lower plasma leptin at parturition, but higher leptin at 19-weeks and insulin resistance at 1-week post-weaning. RNA-sequencing revealed 279 differentially expressed genes in the hypothalamus in 5X-MTHF vs. 5X-FA dams. These findings indicate that MTHF and FA differ in their programing effects on maternal phenotype, and a potential adverse role of either form when given at the higher doses.
33396831/Relationship between Down-Regulation of Copper-Related Genes and Decreased Ferroportin Protein Level in the Duodenum of Iron-Deficient Piglets In mammals, 2 x 1012 red blood cells (RBCs) are produced every day in the bone marrow to ensure a constant supply of iron to maintain effective erythropoiesis. Impaired iron absorption in the duodenum and inefficient iron reutilization from senescent RBCs by macrophages contribute to the development of anemia. Ferroportin (Fpn), the only known cellular iron exporter, as well as hephaestin (Heph) and ceruloplasmin, two copper-dependent ferroxidases involved in the above-mentioned processes, are key elements of the interaction between copper and iron metabolisms. Crosslinks between these metals have been known for many years, but metabolic effects of one on the other have not been elucidated to date. Neonatal iron deficiency anemia in piglets provides an interesting model for studying this interplay. In duodenal enterocytes of young anemic piglets, we identified iron deposits and demonstrated increased expression of ferritin with a concomitant decline in both Fpn and Heph expression. We postulated that the underlying mechanism involves changes in copper distribution within enterocytes as a result of decreased expression of the copper transporter:Atp7b. Obtained results strongly suggest that regulation of iron absorption within enterocytes is based on the interaction between proteins of copper and iron metabolisms and outcompetes systemic regulation.
33401625/An Electrochemical Strategy for the Simultaneous Detection of Doxorubicin and Simvastatin for Their Potential Use in the Treatment of Cancer The aim of this study was to develop a disposable, simple, fast, and sensitive sensor for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of doxorubicin (DOX) and simvastatin (SMV), which could be used in preclinical studies for the development of new pharmaceutical formulations for drug delivery. Firstly, the electrochemical behavior of each molecule was analyzed regarding the influence of electrode material, electrolyte solution, and scan rate. After this, the proper electrode material, electrolyte solution, and scan rate for both active substances were chosen, and a linear sweep voltammetry procedure was optimized for simultaneous detection. Two chronoamperometry procedures were tested, one for the detection of DOX in the presence of SMV, and the other one for the detection of DOX and SMV together. Finally, calibration curves for DOX and SMV in the presence of each other were obtained using both electrochemical methods and the results were compared. The use of amperometry allowed for a better limit of detection (DOX: 0.1 mug/mL; SMV: 0.7 mug/mL) than the one obtained in voltammetry (1.5 mug/mL for both drugs). The limits of quantification using amperometry were 0.5 mug/mL for DOX (dynamic range: 0.5-65 mug/mL) and 2 mug/mL for SMV (dynamic range: 2-65 mug/mL), while using voltammetry 1 mug/mL was obtained for DOX (dynamic range: 1-100 mug/mL) and 5 mug/mL for SMV (dynamic range: 5-100 mug/mL). This detection strategy represents a promising tool for the analysis of new pharmaceutical formulations for targeted drug delivery containing both drugs, whose association was proven to bring benefits in the treatment of cancer.
33396618/Serum Vitamin D Affected Type 2 Diabetes though Altering Lipid Profile and Modified the Effects of Testosterone on Diabetes Status Numerous studies have investigated the associations between serum vitamin D or testosterone and diabetes; however, inconsistencies are observed. Whether there is an interaction between vitamin D and testosterone and whether the lipid profile (total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)) mediates the association between vitamin D and diabetes is unclear. To investigate the effect of vitamin D and testosterone on impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 2659 participants from the Henan Rural Cohort were included in the case-control study. Generalized linear models were utilized to estimate associations of vitamin D with IFG or T2DM and interactive effects of vitamin D and testosterone on IFG or T2DM. Principal component analysis (PCA) and mediation analysis were used to estimate whether the lipid profile mediated the association of vitamin D with IFG or T2DM. Serum 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, and total 25(OH)D levels were negatively correlated with IFG (odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals (CIs)): 0.99 (0.97, 1.00), 0.85 (0.82, 0.88), and 0.97 (0.96, 0.98), respectively). Similarity results for associations between serum 25(OH)D2 and total 25(OH)D with T2DM (ORs (95%CIs): 0.84 (0.81, 0.88) and 0.97 (0.96, 0.99)) were observed, whereas serum 25(OH)D3 was negatively correlated to T2DM only in the quartile 2 (Q2) and Q3 groups (both p < 0.05). The lipid profile, mainly TC and TG, partly mediated the relationship between 25(OH)D2 or total 25(OH)D and IFG or T2DM and the proportion explained was from 2.74 to 17.46%. Furthermore, interactive effects of serum 25(OH)D2, total 25(OH)D, and testosterone on T2DM were observed in females (both p for interactive <0.05), implying that the positive association between serum testosterone and T2DM was vanished when 25(OH)D2 was higher than 10.04 ng/mL or total 25(OH)D was higher than 40.04 ng/mL. Therefore, ensuring adequate vitamin D levels could reduce the prevalence of IFG and T2DM, especially in females with high levels of testosterone.
33383906/Synthesis and Antiplasmodial Activity of Novel Bioinspired Imidazolidinedione Derivatives Malaria is an enormous threat to public health, due to the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to widely-used antimalarials, such as chloroquine (CQ). Current antimalarial drugs are aromatic heterocyclic derivatives, most often containing a basic component with an added alkyl chain in their chemical structure. While these drugs are effective, they have many side effects. This paper presents the synthesis and preliminary physicochemical characterisation of novel bioinspired imidazolidinedione derivatives, where the imidazolidinedione core was linked via the alkylene chain and the basic piperazine component to the bicyclic system. These compounds were tested against the asexual stages of two strains of P. falciparum:the chloroquine-sensitive (D10) and chloroquine-resistant (W2) strains. In parallel, in vitro cytotoxicity was investigated on a human keratinocyte cell line, as well as their hemolytic activity. The results demonstrated that the antiplasmodial effects were stronger against the W2 strain (IC50 between 2424.15-5648.07 ng/mL (4.98-11.95 microM)), compared to the D10 strain (6202.00-9659.70 ng/mL (12.75-19.85 microM)). These molecules were also non-hemolytic to human erythrocytes at a concentration active towards the parasite, but with low toxicity to mammalian cell line. The synthetized derivatives, possessing enhanced antimalarial activity against the CQ-resistant strain of P. falciparum, appear to be interesting antimalarial drug candidates.
33396447/Low Molecular Weight Barley beta-Glucan Affects Glucose and Lipid Metabolism by Prebiotic Effects We investigated the effect of low molecular weight barley beta-glucan (LMW-BG) on cecal fermentation, glucose, and lipid metabolism through comparisons to high molecular weight beta-glucan (HMW-BG). C57BL/6J male mice were fed a moderate-fat diet for 61 days. LMW-BG or HMW-BG was added to the diet corresponding to 4% beta-glucan. We measured the apparent absorption of fat, serum biomarkers, the expression levels of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and ileum, and bacterial counts of the major microbiota groups using real time PCR. The concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecum was analyzed by GC/MS. Significant reductions in serum leptin, total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, and mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) were observed in both BG groups. HMW-BG specific effects were observed in inhibiting fat absorption and reducing abdominal deposit fat, whereas LMW-BG specific effects were observed in increasing bacterial counts of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and cecal total SCFAs, acetate, and propionate. mRNA expression of neurogenin 3 was increased in the LMW-BG group. We report that LMW-BG affects glucose and lipid metabolism via a prebiotic effect, whereas the high viscosity of HMW-BG in the digestive tract is responsible for its specific effects.
33396478/Comparison of alpha-Tocopherol, alpha-Tocopherol Acetate, and alpha-Tocopheryl Polyethylene Glycol Succinate 1000 Absorption by Caco-2 TC7 Intestinal Cells (1) Background: vitamin E is often supplemented in the form of tocopherol acetate, but it has poor bioavailability and can fail to correct blood tocopherol concentrations in some patients with severe cholestasis. In this context, alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate 1000 (TPGS) has been of value, but very little is known about the mechanisms of its absorption. The aim of our work was to evaluate the mechanisms of absorption/secretion of TPGS compared to tocopherol acetate (TAC) and alpha-tocopherol by human enterocyte-like Caco-2 TC7 cells. (2) Methods: two weeks post-confluence Caco-2 cells were incubated with tocopherol- or TAC- or TPGS-rich mixed micelles up to 24 h and, following lipid extraction, TAC and tocopherol amounts were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in apical, cellular, and basolateral compartments. (3) Results: at equivalent concentrations of tocopherol in the apical side, the amounts of tocopherol secreted at the basolateral pole of Caco-2 cells are (i) significantly greater when the tocopherol is in the free form in the micelles; (ii) intermediate when it is in the TAC form in the micelles (p < 0.001); and (iii) significantly lower with the TPGS form (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, our results show, for the first time, that Caco-2 cells secrete one or more esterified forms of the vitamin contained in TPGS at the basolateral side.
33396969/Title Changes in the Mineral Composition of Rat Femoral Bones Induced by Implantation of LNCaP Prostate Cancer Cells and Dietary Supplementation Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequent cancer in men and the fifth most common cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 378,553 deaths in 2020. Prostate cancer shows a strong tendency to form metastatic foci in the bones. A number of interactions between cancer cells attacking bones and cells of the bone matrix lead to destruction of the bone and growth of the tumour. The last few decades have seen increased interest in the precise role of minerals in human health and disease. Tumour cells accumulate various minerals that promote their intensive growth. Bone, as a storehouse of elements, can be a valuable source of them for the growing tumour. There are also reports suggesting that the presence of some tumours, e.g., of the breast, can adversely affect bone structure even in the absence of metastasis to this organ. This paper presents the effect of chronic dietary intake of calcium, iron and zinc, administered in doses corresponding maximally to twice their level in a standard diet, on homeostasis of selected elements (Ca, K, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sr, Ni, Co, Mn and Mo) in the femoral bones of healthy rats and rats with implanted cancer cells of the LNCaP line. The experiment was conducted over 90 days. After the adaptation period, the animals were randomly divided into four dietary groups: standard diet and supplementation with Zn, Fe and Ca. Every dietary group was divided into experimental group (with implanted cancer cells) and control group (without implanted cancer cells). The cancer cells (LnCaP) were implanted intraperitoneally in the amount 1 x 106 to the rats at day 90 of their lifetime. Bone tissue was dried and treated with microwave-assisted mineral digestation. Total elemental content was quantified by ICP-MS. Student's t-test and Anova or Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied in order to compare treatment and dietary groups. In the case of most of the diets, especially the standard diet, the femoral bones of rats with implanted LNCaP cells showed a clear downward trend in the content of the elements tested, which may be indicative of slow osteolysis taking place in the bone tissue. In the group of rats receiving the standard diet, there were significant reductions in the content of Mo (by 83%), Ca (25%), Co (22%), Mn (13%), K (13%) and Sr (9%) in the bone tissue of rats with implanted LNCaP cells in comparison with the control group receiving the same diet but without LNCaP implantation. Supplementation of the rat diet with calcium, zinc and iron decreased the frequency of these changes relative to the standard diet, which may indicate that the diet had an inhibitory effect on bone resorption in conditions of LNCaP implantation. The principal component analysis (PCA) score plot confirms the pronounced effect of implanted LNCaP cells and the standard diet on bone composition. At the same time, supplementation with calcium, zinc and iron seems to improve bone composition. The microelements that most often underwent quantitative changes in the experimental conditions were cobalt, manganese and molybdenum.
33396570/Magnesium and Hypertension in Old Age Hypertension is a complex condition in which various actors and mechanisms combine, resulting in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications that today represent the most frequent causes of mortality, morbidity, disability, and health expenses worldwide. In the last decades, there has been an exceptional amount of experimental, epidemiological, and clinical studies confirming a close relationship between magnesium deficit and high blood pressure. Multiple mechanisms may help to explain the bulk of evidence supporting a protective effect of magnesium against hypertension and its complications. Hypertension increases sharply with advancing age, hence older persons are those most affected by its negative consequences. They are also more frequently at risk of magnesium deficiency by multiple mechanisms, which may, at least in part, explain the higher frequency of hypertension and its long-term complications. The evidence for a favorable effect of magnesium on hypertension risk emphasizes the importance of broadly encouraging the intake of foods such as vegetables, nuts, whole cereals and legumes, optimal dietary sources of magnesium, avoiding processed food, which are very poor in magnesium and other fundamental nutrients, in order to prevent hypertension. In some cases, when diet is not enough to maintain an adequate magnesium status, magnesium supplementation may be of benefit and has been shown to be well tolerated.
33396887/Relationship between Serum 25(OH)D and Depression: Causal Evidence from a Bi-Directional Mendelian Randomization Study The relationship between depression and vitamin D deficiency is complex, with evidence mostly from studies affected by confounding and reverse causality. We examined the causality and direction of the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and depression in bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using information from up to 307,618 white British participants from the UK Biobank and summary results from the SUNLIGHT (n = 79,366) and Psychiatric Genomics consortia (PGC 113,154 cases and 218,523 controls). In observational analysis, the odds of depression decreased with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (adjusted odds ratio (OR) per 50% increase 0.95, 95%CI 0.94-0.96). In MR inverse variance weighted (IVW) using the UK Biobank, there was no association between genetically determined serum 25(OH)D and depression (OR per 50% higher 0.97, 95%CI 0.90-1.05) with consistent null association across all MR approaches and in data from PGC consortium. In contrast, genetic liability to depression was associated with lower 25(OH)D concentrations (MR IVW -3.26%, -4.94%--1.55%), with the estimates remaining generally consistent after meta-analysing with the consortia. In conclusion, we found genetic evidence for a causal effect of depression on lower 25(OH)D concentrations, however we could not confirm a beneficial effect of nutritional vitamin D status on depression risk.
33396346/Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Is Inversely Associated with Monocyte Percentage to HDL Cholesterol Ratio among Young Healthy Adults in Qatar Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is linked to an altered lipid profile. Monocytes play an important role in inflammation and lipid metabolism. Recently, monocyte percentage to HDL-cholesterol ratio (MHR) has emerged as a novel marker of inflammation. We investigated the association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and MHR and serum lipids in young healthy adults. Data from the Qatar Biobank were utilized to investigate the relation between serum 25(OH)D and inflammation and serum lipid concentrations in healthy Qatari adults using multivariate regression analysis. Prevalence of serum 25(OH)D concentrations <12 ng/mL (deficiency), 12-20 ng/mL (insufficiency), and >=20 ng/mL (sufficiency) were 55.8%, 29.9%, and 14.3%, respectively. Serum 25(OH)D was significantly inversely associated with monocyte percentage, MHR, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triacylglycerol in multivariable adjusted analysis. MHR could be a potential biomarker to predict cardiometabolic diseases among young healthy Qataris.
33396230/Providing Comprehensive Dietary Fatty Acid Profiling from Saturates to Polyunsaturates with the Malaysia Lipid Study-Food Frequency Questionnaire: Validation Using the Triads Approach To address limited food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) capacity in public health monitoring in Malaysia, we aimed to develop a semi-quantitative FFQ for an adult multiethnic population for comprehensive fatty acid (FA) profiling inclusive of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), PUFA:SFA ratio, trans fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 FAs. A 240-food itemed FFQ used diet records (DR) of Malaysia Lipid Study (MLS) participants and fatty acid composition database from laboratory analyzed foods. The developed MLS-FFQ underwent face and content validation before relative validation in a free-living population (n = 114). Validation was facilitated for macronutrient data comparisons between DR and FFQ via Spearman's correlation coefficient analyses; and for fatty acid composition data by independent pairing of DR, FFQ and plasma triglyceride using the triads method. Moderate correlation between dietary methods was obtained for macronutrients and FAs (r = 0.225-0.457, p < 0.05) except for omega-3 FAs, presenting good agreement with grossly misclassified nutrients <10%. For fatty acid composition data, the magnitude of validity coefficients (z) for SFA, PUFA, PUFA:SFA ratios and omega-6 FAs by all 3 methods were not significantly different (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the MLS-FFQ was shown to be a valid tool to assess population dietary intakes.
33375432/Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG Reduces beta-conglycinin-Allergy-Induced Apoptotic Cells by Regulating Bacteroides and Bile Secretion Pathway in Intestinal Contents of BALB/c Mice Allergy can cause intestinal damage, including through cell apoptosis. In this study, intestinal cell apoptosis was first observed in the beta-conglycinin (beta-CG) allergy model, and the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on reducing apoptosis of cells in the intestine and its underlying mechanisms were further investigated. Allergic mice received oral LGG daily, and intestinal tissue apoptotic cells, gut microbiota, and metabolites were evaluated six and nine days after intervention. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis revealed that LGG intervention could reduce the incidence of cell apoptosis more effectively than natural recovery (NR). The results of 16S rRNA analysis indicated that LGG intervention led to an increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroides. Metabolite analysis of intestinal contents indicated that histamine, N-acetylhistamine, N(alpha)-gamma-glutamylhistamine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, arachidonic acid malate, and xanthine were significantly decreased, and deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid were significantly increased after the LGG intervention on beta-CG allergy; the decreases in histamine and N(alpha)-gamma-glutamylhistamine were significant compared with those of NR. In conclusion, LGG reduces apoptosis of cells induced by beta-CG allergy, which may be related to regulation of Bacteroides and the bile secretion pathway.
33396520/Hepatorenal Tyrosinaemia: Impact of a Simplified Diet on Metabolic Control and Clinical Outcome Background: Tyrosinaemia type 1 is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by an enzyme defect in the tyrosine degradation pathway. It is treated using nitisinone and a low-protein diet. In a workshop in 2013, a group of nutritional specialists from Germany, Switzerland and Austria agreed to advocate a simplified low-protein diet and to allow more natural protein intake in patients with tyrosinaemia type 1. This retrospective study evaluates the recommendations made at different treatment centers and their impact on clinical symptoms and metabolic control. Methods: For this multicenter study, questionnaires were sent to nine participating treatment centers to collect data on the general therapeutic approach and data of 47 individual patients treated by those centers. Results: Dietary simplification allocating food to 3 categories led to increased tyrosine and phenylalanine blood concentrations without weighing food. Phenylalanine levels were significantly higher in comparison to a strict dietary regimen whereas tyrosine levels in plasma did not change. Non-inferiority was shown for the simplification and liberalization of the diet. Compliance with dietary recommendations was higher using the simplified diet in comparison to the stricter approach. Age correlates negatively with compliance. Conclusions: Simplification of the diet with increased natural protein intake based on three categories of food may be implemented in the diet of patients with tyrosinaemia type 1 without significantly altering metabolic control. Patient compliance is strongly influencing tyrosine blood concentrations. A subsequent prospective study with a larger sample size is necessary to get a better insight into the effect of dietary recommendations on metabolic control.
33396458/Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Homocysteine at Birth and Fatty Acid Desaturase Gene Cluster Polymorphisms Are Associated with Children's Processing Speed up to Age 9 Years Both pre- and early postnatal supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA) and folate have been related to neural development, but their long-term effects on later neural function remain unclear. We evaluated the long-term effects of maternal prenatal supplementation with fish-oil (FO), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), placebo or FO + 5-MTHF, as well as the role of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster polymorphisms, on their offspring's processing speed at later school age. This study was conducted in NUHEAL children at 7.5 (n = 143) and 9 years of age (n = 127). Processing speed tasks were assessed using Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Children Color Trails Test (CCTT) and Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT). Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, folate and total homocysteine (tHcy) levels were determined at delivery from maternal and cord blood samples. FADS and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C > T genetic polymorphisms were analyzed. Mixed models (linear and logistic) were performed. There were significant differences in processing speed performance among children at different ages (p < 0.001). The type of prenatal supplementation had no effect on processing speed in children up to 9 years. Secondary exploratory analyses indicated that children born to mothers with higher AA/DHA ratio at delivery (p < 0.001) and heterozygotes for FADS1 rs174556 (p < 0.05) showed better performance in processing speed at 9 years. Negative associations between processing speed scores and maternal tHcy levels at delivery were found. Our findings suggest speed processing development in children up to 9 years could be related to maternal factors, including AA/DHA and tHcy levels, and their genetic background, mainly FADS polymorphism. These considerations support that maternal prenatal supplementation should be quantitatively adequate and individualized to obtain better brain development and mental performance in the offspring.
33396265/Modulatory Effects of Osthole on Lipopolysaccharides-Induced Inflammation in Caco-2 Cell Monolayer and Co-Cultures with THP-1 and THP-1-Derived Macrophages Lipopolysaccharydes (LPS) are responsible for the intestinal inflammatory reaction, as they may disrupt tight junctions and induce cytokines (CKs) secretion. Osthole has a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, thus its anti-inflammatory potential in the LPS-treated Caco-2 cell line as well as in Caco-2/THP-1 and Caco-2/macrophages co-cultures was investigated. In brief, Caco-2 cells and co-cultures were incubated with LPS to induce an inflammatory reaction, after which osthole (150-450 ng/mL) was applied to reduce this effect. After 24 h, the level of secreted CKs and changes in gene expression were examined. LPS significantly increased the levels of IL-1beta, -6, -8, and TNF-alpha, while osthole reduced this effect in a concentration-dependent manner, with the most significant decrease when a 450 ng/mL dose was applied (p < 0.0001). A similar trend was observed in changes in gene expression, with the significant osthole efficiency at a concentration of 450 ng/muL for IL1R1 and COX-2 (p < 0.01) and 300 ng/muL for NF-kappaB (p < 0.001). Osthole increased Caco-2 monolayer permeability, thus if it would ever be considered as a potential drug for minimizing intestinal inflammatory symptoms, its safety should be confirmed in extended in vitro and in vivo studies.
33396948/Eight Days of Water-Only Fasting Promotes Favorable Changes in the Functioning of the Urogenital System of Middle-Aged Healthy Men The aim of this study was to determine whether, after 8 days of water-only fasting, there are changes in the efficiency of the lower urinary tract, the concentration of sex hormones, and the symptoms of prostate diseases in a group of middle-aged men (n = 14). For this purpose, before and after 8 days of water-only fasting (subjects drank ad libitum moderately mineralized water), and the following somatic and blood concentration measurements were made: total prostate specific antigen (PSA-T), free prostate specific antigen (PSA-F), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteotropic hormone (LH), prolactin (Pr), total testosterone (T-T), free testosterone (T-F), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), sex hormone globulin binding (SHGB), total cholesterol (Ch-T), beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB). In addition, prostate volume (PV), volume of each testis (TV), total volume of both testes (TTV), maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax), and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) values were determined. The results showed that after 8 days of water-only fasting, Qmax and IPSS improved but PV and TTV decreased significantly. There was also a decrease in blood levels of PSA-T, FSH, P, T-T, T-F, and DHEA, but SHGB concentration increased significantly. These results indicate that 8 days of water-only fasting improved lower urinary tract functions without negative health effects.
33374784/Niacin and Butyrate: Nutraceuticals Targeting Dysbiosis and Intestinal Permeability in Parkinson's Disease Dysbiosis is implicated by many studies in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Advances in sequencing technology and computing have resulted in confounding data regarding pathogenic bacterial profiles in conditions such as PD. Changes in the microbiome with reductions in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and increases in endotoxin-producing bacteria likely contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. GPR109A, a G-protein coupled receptor found on the surface of the intestinal epithelium and immune cells, plays a key role in controlling intestinal permeability and the inflammatory cascade. The absence of GPR109A receptors is associated with decreased concentration of tight junction proteins, leading to increased intestinal permeability and susceptibility to inflammation. In inflammatory states, butyrate acts via GPR109A to increase concentrations of tight junction proteins and improve intestinal permeability. Niacin deficiency is exacerbated in PD by dopaminergic medications. Niacin supplementation has been shown to shift macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile. Niacin and butyrate, promising nutrients and unique ligands for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A, are reviewed in this paper in detail.
33396889/Low-Carbohydrate High-Fat Diet and Exercise: Effect of a 10-Week Intervention on Body Composition and CVD Risk Factors in Overweight and Obese Women:A Randomized Controlled Trial We assessed the effect of weight-loss induced with a low-carbohydrate-high-fat diet with and without exercise, on body-composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 57 overweight and obese women (age 40 +- 3.5 years, body mass index 31.1 +- 2.6 kg m-2) completed a 10-week intervention using a low-carbohydrate-high-fat diet, with or without interval exercise. An equal deficit of 700 kcal day-1 was prescribed, restricting diet only, or moderately restricting diet and adding exercise, producing four groups; normal diet (NORM); low-carbohydrate-high-fat diet (LCHF); normal diet and exercise (NORM-EX); and low-carbohydrate-high-fat diet and exercise (LCHF-EX). Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group differences. The intervention resulted in an average 6.7 +- 2.5% weight-loss (p < 0.001). Post-intervention % fat was lower in NORM-EX than NORM (40.0 +- 4.2 vs. 43.5 +- 3.5%, p = 0.024). NORM-EX reached lower values in total cholesterol than NORM (3.9 +- 0.6 vs. 4.7 +- 0.7 mmol/L, p = 0.003), and LCHF-EX (3.9 +- 0.6 vs. 4.9 +- 1.1 mmol/L, p = 0.004). Post intervention triglycerides levels were lower in NORM-EX than NORM (0.87 +- 0.21 vs. 1.11 +- 0.34 mmol/L, p = 0.030). The low-carbohydrate-high-fat diet had no superior effect on body composition, O2peak or cardiovascular risk factors compared to a normal diet, with or without exercise. In conclusion, the intervention decreased fat mass, but exercise improved body composition and caused the most favorable changes in total cholesterol and triglycerides in the NORM-EX. Exercise increased cardiorespiratory fitness, regardless of diet.
33396781/Temporal Changes in Breast Milk Fatty Acids Contents: A Case Study of Malay Breastfeeding Women The composition of human breast milk changes in the first two months of life, adapting itself to the evolving needs of the growing new-born. Lipids in milk are a source of energy, essential fatty acids (FA), fat-soluble vitamins, and vital bioactive components. Information on breast milk FA of Malaysian lactating women is scarce. Based on convenience sampling, a total of 20 Malay breastfeeding women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited. Breast milk was collected three times from each subject at consecutive intervals of 2-3 weeks apart. A total of 60 breast milk samples were collected and classified into "transitional milk" (n = 8), "early milk" (n = 26) and "mature milk" (n = 26). All milk samples were air freighted to University of Groningen, Netherlands for analysis. The dominant breast milk FA were oleic acid, constituting 33% of total fatty acids, followed by palmitic acid (26%). Both these FA and the essential FA, linoleic acid (10%) and alpha-linolenic acid (0.4%), showed no significant changes from transitional to mature milk. Breast milk ratio of n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was comparatively high, exceeding 10 throughout the lactation period, suggesting a healthier balance of PUFA intake is needed in pregnancy and at postpartum.
33375477/Serum and Whole Blood Cu and Zn Status in Predicting Mortality in Lung Cancer Patients Alterations in circulating Cu and Zn are negative predictors of survival in neoplastic patients and are known during lung cancer. However, no data on predicting mortality of lung cancer patients based on the level of these elements in the blood have been presented to date. The aims of this prospective cohort study were as follows: (i) To evaluate the disturbances in serum and whole blood Cu and Zn, (ii) to assess the relationships between serum and whole blood Cu and Zn status and clinical, sociodemographic, and nutritional data, and (iii) to investigate the association of Cu and Zn status with all-cause mortality in lung cancer. Naive-treatment lung cancer patients (n = 167) were characterized in terms of sociodemographic, clinical, and anthropometric data and dietary intake and compared with sex-matched control subjects (n = 48). Whole blood and serum Cu and Zn status was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for multiple confounders/mediators were used to estimate the association between all-cause death and Cu and Zn status. Sex, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, clinical stage, and hemoglobin, platelet, and glucose concentrations significantly differentiated Cu and Zn status. All-cause mortality in lung cancer patients was positively associated with serum Cu levels, Cu:Zn ratio, and whole blood Zn levels. However, an advanced clinical stage of disease was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Circulatory status of Cu and Zn might be included in routine clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer patients as additional prognostic variables, but only after further more detail studies.
33375244/Cordyceps militaris Fruit Body Extract Decreases Testosterone Catabolism and Testosterone-Stimulated Prostate Hypertrophy The androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are essential for a variety of systemic functions in mature males. Alteration of these hormones results in late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The fruit bodies of fungi of the genus Cordyceps have been regarded as folk medicine or health food with tonic and antifatigue effects. The extract from the fruit body of Cordyceps militaris parasitizing Samia cynthia ricini (CM) was evaluated as a novel-candidate natural product for ameliorating male andropause symptoms. To explore the effects of CM on LOH and BPH, CM was applied to rat models and cultured testicular cells and prostate cells. The concentrations of androgens in the serum and culture media were determined by ELISA. Expression of steroidogenic enzymes and androgen-related genes was evaluated by qPCR, and prostatic cell proliferation was assessed with the cell-viability assay. CM maintained the serum levels of testosterone and DHT, but inhibited testosterone-induced prostate hypertrophy. CM also increased the secretion of testosterone and DHT by primary testicular cells, with no changes in the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes, but decreased the growth of prostatic cell lines. Our data suggest that CM could improve both LOH and BPH in males.
33383796/Anti-Inflammatory, Antioxidant, and Wound-Healing Properties of Cyanobacteria from Thermal Mud of Balaruc-Les-Bains, France: A Multi-Approach Study Background: The Balaruc-les-Bains' thermal mud was found to be colonized predominantly by microorganisms, with cyanobacteria constituting the primary organism in the microbial biofilm observed on the mud surface. The success of cyanobacteria in colonizing this specific ecological niche can be explained in part by their taxa-specific adaptation capacities, and also the diversity of bioactive natural products that they synthesize. This array of components has physiological and ecological properties that may be exploited for various applications. Methods: Nine cyanobacterial strains were isolated from Balaruc thermal mud and maintained in the Paris Museum Collection (PMC). Full genome sequencing was performed coupled with targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses (HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS). Bioassays were performed to determine antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties. Results: Biosynthetic pathways for phycobiliproteins, scytonemin, and carotenoid pigments and 124 metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were characterized. Several compounds with known antioxidant or anti-inflammatory properties, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, mycosporine-like amino acids, and aeruginosins, and other bioactive metabolites like microginins, microviridins, and anabaenolysins were identified. Secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 appeared to be inhibited by crude extracts of Planktothricoides raciborskii PMC 877.14, Nostoc sp. PMC 881.14, and Pseudo-chroococcus couteii PMC 885.14. The extract of the Aliinostoc sp. PMC 882.14 strain was able to slightly enhance migration of HaCat cells that may be helpful in wound healing. Several antioxidant compounds were detected, but no significant effects on nitric oxide secretion were observed. There was no cytotoxicity on the three cell types tested, indicating that cyanobacterial extracts may have anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential without harming body cells. These data open up promising uses for these extracts and their respective molecules in drugs or thermal therapies.
33396718/A Novel Dietary Intervention Reduces Circulatory Branched-Chain Amino Acids by 50%: A Pilot Study of Relevance for Obesity and Diabetes Elevated circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; isoleucine, leucine, and valine) are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Reducing circulatory BCAAs by dietary restriction was suggested to mitigate these risks in rodent models, but this is a challenging paradigm to deliver in humans. We aimed to design and assess the feasibility of a diet aimed at reducing circulating BCAA concentrations in humans, while maintaining energy balance and overall energy/protein intake. Twelve healthy individuals were assigned to either a 7-day BCAA-restricted diet or a 7-day control diet. Diets were iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric, with only BCAA levels differing between the two. The BCAA-restricted diet significantly reduced circulating BCAA concentrations by ~50% i.e., baseline 437 +- 60 to 217 +- 40 micromol/L (p < 0.005). Individually, both valine (245 +- 33 to 105 +- 23 micromol/L; p < 0.0001), and leucine (130 +- 20 to 75 +- 13 micromol/L; p < 0.05), decreased significantly in response to the BCAA-restricted diet. The BCAA-restricted diet marginally lowered Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) levels: baseline 1.5 +- 0.2 to 1.0 +- 0.1; (p = 0.096). We successfully lowered circulating BCAAs by 50% while maintaining iso-nitrogenous, iso-caloric dietary intakes, and while meeting the recommended daily allowances (RDA) for protein requirements. The present pilot study represents a novel dietary means by which to reduce BCAA, and as such, provides a blueprint for a potential dietary therapeutic in obesity/diabetes.
33466274/The Combined Effects of Magnesium Oxide and Inulin on Intestinal Microbiota and Cecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Constipation is a common condition that occurs in many people worldwide. While magnesium oxide (MgO) is often used as the first-line drug for chronic constipation in Japan, dietary fiber intake is also recommended. Dietary fiber is fermented by microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs are involved in regulating systemic physiological functions and circadian rhythm. We examined the effect of combining MgO and the water-soluble dietary fiber, inulin, on cecal SCFA concentration and microbiota in mice. We also examined the MgO administration timing effect on cecal SCFAs. The cecal SCFA concentrations were measured by gas chromatography, and the microbiota was determined using next-generation sequencing. Inulin intake decreased cecal pH and increased cecal SCFA concentrations while combining MgO increased the cecal pH lowered by inulin and decreased the cecal SCFA concentrations elevated by inulin. When inulin and MgO were combined, significant changes in the microbiota composition were observed compared with inulin alone. The MgO effect on the cecal acetic acid concentration was less when administered at ZT12 than at ZT0. In conclusion, this study suggests that MgO affects cecal SCFA and microbiota during inulin feeding, and the effect on acetic acid concentration is time-dependent.
33466262/Physicochemical Properties and Effects of Honeys on Key Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress and Cholesterol Homeostasis in HepG2 Cells Manuka honey and newly developed honeys (arjuna, guggul, jiaogulan and olive) were examined for their physicochemical, biochemical properties and effects on oxidative stress and cholesterol homeostasis in fatty acid-induced HepG2 cells. The honeys exhibited standard moisture content (<20%), electrical conductivity (<0.8 mS/cm), acidic pH, and monosaccharides (>60%), except olive honey (<60% total monosaccharides). They all expressed non-Newtonian behavior and 05 typical regions of the FTIR spectra as those of natural ones. Guggul and arjuna, manuka honeys showed the highest phenolic contents, correlating with their significant antioxidant activities. Arjuna, guggul and manuka honeys demonstrated the agreement of total cholesterol reduction and the transcriptional levels of AMPK, SREBP2, HCMGR, LDLR, LXRalpha. Jiaogulan honey showed the least antioxidant content and activity, but it was the most cytotoxic. Both jiaogulan and olive honeys modulated the tested gene in the pattern that should lead to a lower TC content, but this reduction did not occur after 24 h. All 2% concentrations of tested honeys elicited a clearer effect on NQO1 gene expression. In conclusion, the new honeys complied with international norms for natural honeys and we provide partial evidence for the protective effects of manuka, arjuna and guggul honeys amongst the tested ones on key biomarkers of oxidative stress and cholesterol homeostasis, pending further studies to better understand their modes of action.
33485352/Baicalein inhibits inflammatory response and promotes osteogenic activity in periodontal ligament cells challenged with lipopolysaccharides Background Periodontitis is a chronic infection initiated by oral bacterial and their virulence factors, yet the severity of periodontitis is largely determined by the dysregulated host immuno-inflammatory response. Baicalein is a flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis with promising anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to clarify the anti-inflammatory and osteogenic effects of baicalein in periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Methods Human PDLCs were incubated with baicalein (0-100 muM) for 2 h prior to LPS challenge for 24 h. MTT analysis was adopted to assess the cytoxicity of baicalein. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory and osteogenic markers were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as appropriate. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were performed to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of PDLCs. The expression of Wnt/beta-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling related proteins was assessed by western blot. Results MTT results showed that baicalein up to 100 muM had no cytotoxicity on PDLCs. Baicalein significantly attenuated the inflammatory factors induced by LPS, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), MMP-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) at both mRNA and protein level. Moreover, MAPK signaling (ERK, JNK and p38) was significantly inhibited by baicalein, which may account for the mitigated inflammatory response. Next, we found that baicalein effectively restored the osteogenic differentiation of LPS-treated PDLCs, as shown by the increased ALP and ARS staining. Accordingly, the protein and gene expression of osteogenic markers, namely runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), collagen-I, and osterix were markedly upregulated. Importantly, baicalein could function as the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activator, which may lead to the increased osteoblastic differentiation of PDLCs. Conclusions With the limitation of the study, we provide in vitro evidence that baicalein ameliorates inflammatory response and restores osteogenesis in PDLCs challenged with LPS, indicating its potential use as the host response modulator for the management of periodontitis.

33418931/Camphor and Eucalyptol:Anticandidal Spectrum, Antivirulence Effect, Efflux Pumps Interference and Cytotoxicity Candidaalbicans represents one of the most common fungal pathogens. Due to its increasing incidence and the poor efficacy of available antifungals, finding novel antifungal molecules is of great importance. Camphor and eucalyptol are bioactive terpenoid plant constituents and their antifungal properties have been explored previously. In this study, we examined their ability to inhibit the growth of different Candida species in suspension and biofilm, to block hyphal transition along with their impact on genes encoding for efflux pumps (CDR1 and CDR2), ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG11), and cytotoxicity to primary liver cells. Camphor showed excellent antifungal activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.125-0.35 mg/mL while eucalyptol was active in the range of 2-23 mg/mL. The results showed camphor's potential to reduce fungal virulence traits, that is, biofilm establishment and hyphae formation. On the other hand, camphor and eucalyptol treatments upregulated CDR1; CDR2 was positively regulated after eucalyptol application while camphor downregulated it. Neither had an impact on ERG11 expression. The beneficial antifungal activities of camphor were achieved with an amount that was non-toxic to porcine liver cells, making it a promising antifungal compound for future development. The antifungal concentration of eucalyptol caused cytotoxic effects and increased expression of efflux pump genes, which suggests that it is an unsuitable antifungal candidate.
33418865/Osteogenic Properties of 3D-Printed Silica-Carbon-Calcite Composite Scaffolds: Novel Approach for Personalized Bone Tissue Regeneration Carbon enriched bioceramic (C-Bio) scaffolds have recently shown exceptional results in terms of their biological and mechanical properties. The present study aims at assessing the ability of the C-Bio scaffolds to affect the commitment of canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cAD-MSCs) and investigating the influence of carbon on cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of cAD-MSCs in vitro. The commitment of cAD-MSCs to an osteoblastic phenotype has been evaluated by expression of several osteogenic markers using real-time PCR. Biocompatibility analyses through 3-(4,5-dimethyl- thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, hemolysis assay, and Ames test demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of both materials. A significant increase in the extracellular alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression of runt-related transcription factor (RUNX), ALP, osterix (OSX), and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Beta ligand (RANKL) genes was observed in C-Bio scaffolds compared to those without carbon (Bio). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated excellent cell attachment on both material surfaces; however, the cellular layer on C-Bio fibers exhibited an apparent secretome activity. Based on our findings, graphene can improve cell adhesion, growth, and osteogenic differentiation of cAD-MSCs in vitro. This study proposed carbon as an additive for a novel three-dimensional (3D)-printable biocompatible scaffold which could become the key structural material for bone tissue reconstruction.
33482727/Transcriptional and proteomic insights into phytotoxic activity of interspecific potato hybrids with low glycoalkaloid contents Background Glycoalkaloids are bioactive compounds that contribute to the defence response of plants against herbivore attack and during pathogenesis. Solanaceous plants, including cultivated and wild potato species, are sources of steroidal glycoalkaloids. Solanum plants differ in the content and composition of glycoalkaloids in organs. In wild and cultivated potato species, more than 50 steroidal glycoalkaloids were recognized. Steroidal glycoalkaloids are recognized as potential allelopathic/phytotoxic compounds that may modify the growth of target plants. There are limited data on the impact of the composition of glycoalkaloids on their phytotoxic potential. Results The presence of alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine in potato leaf extracts corresponded to the high phytotoxic potential of the extracts. Among the differentially expressed genes between potato leaf bulks with high and low phytotoxic potential, the most upregulated transcripts in sample of high phytotoxic potential were anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase-like and subtilisin-like protease SBT1.7-transcript variant X2. The most downregulated genes were carbonic anhydrase chloroplastic-like and miraculin-like. An analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed that the most abundant group of proteins were those related to stress and defence, including glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase acidic isoform, whose expression level was 47.96x higher in potato leaf extract with low phytotoxic. Conclusions The phytotoxic potential of potato leaf extract possessing low glycoalkaloid content is determined by the specific composition of these compounds in leaf extract, where alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine may play significant roles. Differentially expressed gene and protein profiles did not correspond to the glycoalkaloid biosynthesis pathway in the expression of phytotoxic potential. We cannot exclude the possibility that the phytotoxic potential is influenced by other compounds that act antagonistically or may diminish the glycoalkaloids effect.

33485357/A comparison of glycemic parameters and their relationship with C-peptide and Proinsulin levels during partial remission and non-remission periods in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus - a cross-sectional study Background Currently, there is a lack of data relating to glycemic parameters and their relationship with C-peptide (CP) and proinsulin (PI) during the partial remission period (PRP) in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). The aim of this study was to evaluate glycemic parameters in children with T1D who are in the PRP using intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring systems (isCGMS) and to investigate any relationships between CP and PI levels. Methods The study included 21 children who were in the PRP and 31 children who were not. A cross-sectional, non-randomized study was performed. Demographic, clinical data were collected and 2 week- isCGMS data were retrieved. Results The Serum CP showed a positive correlation with time-in-range in the PRP (p:0.03), however PI showed no correlations with glycemic parameters in both periods. The Serum CP and PI levels and the PI:CP ratio were significantly higher in the PRP group than in the non-PRP group. In the non-PRP group, the PI level was below 0.1 pmol/L (which is the detectable limit) in only 2 of the 17 cases as compared with none in the PRP group. Similarly, only 2 of the 17 children in the non-PRP group had CP levels of less than 0.2 nmol / L, although both had detectable PI levels. Overall time-in-range (3. 9-1.0 mmol/L) was significantly high in the PRP group. In contrast, the mean sensor glucose levels, time spent in hyperglycemia, and coefficient of variation levels (32.2vs 40.5%) were significantly lower in the PRP group. Conclusions Although the mean glucose and time in range during the PRP was better than that in the non-PRP group, the glycemic variability during this period was not as low as expected. While the CP levels showed an association with TIR during the PRP, there was no correlation between PI levels and glycemic parameters. Further studies are needed to determine if PI might prove to be a useful parameter in clinical follow-up.
33482728/Transcriptomic and chemical analyses to identify candidate genes involved in color variation of sainfoin flowers Background Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop) is not only a high-quality legume forage, but also a nectar-producing plant. Therefore, the flower color of sainfoin is an important agronomic trait, but the factors affecting its flower phenotype are still unclear. To gain insights into the regulatory networks associated with metabolic pathways of coloration compounds (flavonoids or anthocyanins) and identify the key genes, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, metabolome and transcriptome of WF and AF of sainfoin. Results Delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin derivatives were the main anthocyanin compounds in the AF of sainfoin. These substances were not detected in the WF of sainfoin. The transcriptomes of WF and AF in sainfoin at the S1 and S3 stages were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. Overall, 10,166 (4273 upregulated and 5893 downregulated) and 15,334 (8174 upregulated and 7160 downregulated) DEGs were identified in flowers at S1 and S3 stages, respectively (WF-VS-AF). KEGG pathway annotations showed that 6396 unigenes were annotated to 120 pathways and contained 866 DEGs at S1 stages, and 6396 unigenes were annotated to 131 pathways and included 1546 DEGs at the S3 stage. Nine DEGs belonging to the "flavonoid biosynthesis"and "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis" pathways involved in flower color formation were identified and verified by RT-qPCR analyses. Among these DEGs, 4CL3, FLS, ANS, CHS, DFR and CHI2 exhibited downregulated expression, and F3H exhibited upregulated expression in the WF compared to the AF, resulting in a decrease in anthocyanin synthesis and the formation of WF in sainfoin. Conclusions This study is the first to use transcriptome technology to study the mechanism of white flower formation in sainfoin. Our transcriptome data will be a great enrichment of the genetic information for sainfoin. In addition, the data presented herein will provide valuable molecular information for genetic breeding and provide insight into the future study of flower color polymorphisms in sainfoin.

33419017/Tetraoctylammonium, a Long Chain Quaternary Ammonium Blocker, Promotes a Noncollapsed, Resting-Like Inactivated State in KcsA Alkylammonium salts have been used extensively to study the structure and function of potassium channels. Here, we use the hydrophobic tetraoctylammonium (TOA+) to shed light on the structure of the inactivated state of KcsA, a tetrameric prokaryotic potassium channel that serves as a model to its homologous eukaryotic counterparts. By the combined use of a thermal denaturation assay and the analysis of homo-Forster resonance energy transfer in a mutant channel containing a single tryptophan (W67) per subunit, we found that TOA+ binds the channel cavity with high affinity, either with the inner gate open or closed. Moreover, TOA+ bound at the cavity allosterically shifts the equilibrium of the channel's selectivity filter conformation from conductive to an inactivated-like form. The inactivated TOA+-KcsA complex exhibits a loss in the affinity towards permeant K+ at pH 7.0, when the channel is in its closed state, but maintains the two sets of K+ binding sites and the W67-W67 intersubunit distances characteristic of the selectivity filter in the channel resting state. Thus, the TOA+-bound state differs clearly from the collapsed channel state described by X-ray crystallography and claimed to represent the inactivated form of KcsA.
33418975/Flavonoids: Nutraceuticals for Rheumatic Diseases via Targeting of Inflammasome Activation Inflammation, an innate immune response that prevents cellular damage caused by pathogens, consists of two successive mechanisms, namely priming and triggering. While priming is an inflammation-preparation step, triggering is an inflammation-activation step, and the central feature of triggering is the activation of inflammasomes and intracellular inflammatory protein complexes. Flavonoids are natural phenolic compounds predominantly present in plants, fruits, and vegetables and are known to possess strong anti-inflammatory activities. The anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids has long been demonstrated, with the main focus on the priming mechanisms, while increasing numbers of recent studies have redirected the research focus on the triggering step, and studies have reported that flavonoids inhibit inflammatory responses and diseases by targeting inflammasome activation. Rheumatic diseases are systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that primarily affect joints and connective tissues, and they are associated with numerous deleterious effects. Here, we discuss the emerging literature on the ameliorative role of flavonoids targeting inflammasome activation in inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
33418978/Steroidogenesis in Peripheral and Transition Zones of Human Prostate Cancer Tissue The peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) represent about 70% of the human prostate gland with each zone having differential ability to develop prostate cancer. Androgens and their receptor are the primary driving cause of prostate cancer growth and eventually castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). De novo steroidogenesis has been identified as a key mechanism that develops during CRPC. Currently, there is very limited information available on human prostate tissue steroidogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate steroid metabolism in human prostate cancer tissues with comparison between PZ and TZ. Human prostate cancer tumors were procured from the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy without any neoadjuvant therapy. Human prostate homogenates were used to quantify steroid levels intrinsically present in the tissues as well as formed after incubation with 2 microg/mL of 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OH-pregnenolone) or progesterone. A Waters Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to a Quattro Premier XE tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer using a C18 column was used to measure thirteen steroids from the classical and backdoor steroidogenesis pathways. The intrinsic prostate tissue steroid levels were similar between PZ and TZ with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), pregnenolone and 17-OH-pregnenolone levels higher than the other steroids measured. Interestingly, 5-pregnan-3,20-dione, 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one, and 5-pregnan-17-ol-3,20-dione formation was significantly higher in both the zones of prostate tissues, whereas, androstenedione, testosterone, DHT, and progesterone levels were significantly lower after 60 min incubation compared to the 0 min control incubations. The incubations with progesterone had a similar outcome with 5-pregnan-3,20-dione and 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one levels were elevated and the levels of DHT were lower in both PZ and TZ tissues. The net changes in steroid formation after the incubation were more observable with 17-OH-pregnenolone than with progesterone. In our knowledge, this is the first report of comprehensive analyses of intrinsic prostate tissue steroids and precursor-driven steroid metabolism using a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In summary, the PZ and TZ of human prostate exhibited similar steroidogenic ability with distinction in the manner each zone utilizes the steroid precursors to divert the activity towards backdoor pathway through a complex matrix of steroidogenic mechanisms.
33419064/Down-Regulation of Claudin-2 Expression by Cyanidin-3-Glucoside Enhances Sensitivity to Anticancer Drugs in the Spheroid of Human Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells Claudin-2 (CLDN2), an integral membrane protein located at tight junctions, is abnormally expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues, and is linked to drug resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. CLDN2 may be a target for the prevention of lung adenocarcinoma, but there are few compounds which can reduce CLDN2 expression. We found that cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), the anthocyanin with two hydroxyl groups on the B-ring, and cyanidin significantly reduce the protein level of CLDN2 in A549 cells. In contrast, pelargonidin-3-glucoside (P3G), the anthocyanin with one hydroxyl group on the B-ring, had no effect. These results suggest that cyanidin and the hydroxyl group at the 3-position on the B-ring play an important role in the reduction of CLDN2 expression. The phosphorylation of Akt, an activator of CLDN2 expression at the transcriptional level, was inhibited by C3G, but not by P3G. The endocytosis and lysosomal degradation are suggested to be involved in the C3G-induced decrease in CLDN2 protein expression. C3G increased the phosphorylation of p38 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 rescued the C3G-induced decrease in CLDN2 expression. In addition, SB203580 rescued the protein stability of CLDN2. C3G may reduce CLDN2 expression at the transcriptional and post-translational steps mediated by inhibiting Akt and activating p38, respectively. C3G enhanced the accumulation and cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (DXR) in the spheroid models. The percentages of apoptotic and necrotic cells induced by DXR were increased by C3G. Our data suggest that C3G-rich foods can prevent the chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells through the reduction of CLDN2 expression.
33419052/Annexin 1 Is a Component of eATP-Induced Cytosolic Calcium Elevation in Arabidopsis thaliana Roots Extracellular ATP (eATP) has long been established in animals as an important signalling molecule but this is less understood in plants. The identification of Arabidopsis thaliana DORN1 (Does Not Respond to Nucleotides) as the first plant eATP receptor has shown that it is fundamental to the elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) as a possible second messenger. eATP causes other downstream responses such as increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide, plus changes in gene expression. The plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels involved in eATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase remain unknown at the genetic level. Arabidopsis thaliana Annexin 1 has been found to mediate ROS-activated Ca2+ influx in root epidermis, consistent with its operating as a transport pathway. In this study, the loss of function Annexin 1 mutant was found to have impaired [Ca2+]cyt elevation in roots in response to eATP or eADP. Additionally, this annexin was implicated in modulating eATP-induced intracellular ROS accumulation in roots as well as expression of eATP-responsive genes. 
33419098/Green Synthesis of Chromium Oxide Nanoparticles for Antibacterial, Antioxidant Anticancer, and Biocompatibility Activities This study deals with the green synthesis of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) nanoparticles using a leaf extract of Abutilon indicum (L.) Sweet as a reducing and capping agent. Different characterization techniques were used to characterize the synthesized nanoparticles such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction technique confirmed the purity and crystallinity of the Cr2O3 nanoparticles. The average size of the nanoparticles ranged from 17 to 42 nm. The antibacterial activity of the green synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated against four different bacterial strains, E. coli, S. aureus, B. bronchiseptica, and B. subtilis using agar well diffusion and a live/dead staining assay. The anticancer activities were determined against Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cancer cells using MTT and a live/dead staining assay. Antioxidant activity was investigated in the linoleic acid system. Moreover, the cytobiocompatibility was analyzed against the Vero cell lines using MTT and a live/dead staining assay. The results demonstrated that the green synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles exhibited superior antibacterial activity in terms of zones of inhibition (ZOIs) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria compared to plant extracts and chemically synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles (commercial), but comparable to the standard drug (Leflox). The green synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles exhibited significant anticancer and antioxidant activities against MCF-7 cancerous cells and the linoleic acid system, respectively, compared to chemically synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles. Moreover, cytobiocompatibility analysis displayed that they presented excellent biocompatibility with Vero cell lines than that of chemically synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles. These results suggest that the green synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles' enhanced biological activities might be attributed to a synergetic effect. Hence, green synthesized Cr2O3 nanoparticles could prove to be promising candidates for future biomedical applications.
33419066/Effects of Rifaximin on Luminal and Wall-Adhered Gut Commensal Microbiota in Mice Rifaximin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that ameliorates symptomatology in inflammatory/functional gastrointestinal disorders. We assessed changes in gut commensal microbiota (GCM) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) associated to rifaximin treatment in mice. Adult C57BL/6NCrl mice were treated (7/14 days) with rifaximin (50/150 mg/mouse/day, PO). Luminal and wall-adhered ceco-colonic GCM were characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and microbial profiles determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Colonic expression of TLR2/3/4/5/7 and immune-related markers was assessed (RT-qPCR). Regardless the period of treatment or the dose, rifaximin did not alter total bacterial counts or bacterial biodiversity. Only a modest increase in Bacteroides spp. (150 mg/1-week treatment) was detected. In control conditions, only Clostridium spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were found attached to the colonic epithelium. Rifaximin showed a tendency to favour their adherence after a 1-week, but not 2-week, treatment period. Minor up-regulation in TLRs expression was observed. Only the 50 mg dose for 1-week led to a significant increase (by 3-fold) in TLR-4 expression. No changes in the expression of immune-related markers were observed. Rifaximin, although its antibacterial properties, induces minor changes in luminal and wall-adhered GCM in healthy mice. Moreover, no modulation of TLRs or local immune systems was observed. These findings, in normal conditions, do not rule out a modulatory role of rifaximin in inflammatory and or dysbiotic states of the gut.
33419163/Key Properties of a Bioactive Ag-SiO2/TiO2 Coating on NiTi Shape Memory Alloy as Necessary at the Development of a New Class of Biomedical Materials Recent years have seen the dynamic development of methods for functionalizing the surface of implants using biomaterials that can mimic the physical and mechanical nature of native tissue, prevent the formation of bacterial biofilm, promote osteoconduction, and have the ability to sustain cell proliferation. One of the concepts for achieving this goal, which is presented in this work, is to functionalize the surface of NiTi shape memory alloy by an atypical glass-like nanocomposite that consists of SiO2-TiO2 with silver nanoparticles. However, determining the potential medical uses of bio(nano)coating prepared in this way requires an analysis of its surface roughness, tribology, or wettability, especially in the context of the commonly used reference coat-forming hydroxyapatite (HAp). According to our results, the surface roughness ranged between (112 +- 3) nm (Ag-SiO2):(141 +- 5) nm (HAp), the water contact angle was in the range (74.8 +- 1.6)  (Ag-SiO2):(70.6 +- 1.2)  (HAp), while the surface free energy was in the range of 45.4 mJ/m2 (Ag-SiO2):46.8 mJ/m2 (HAp). The adhesive force and friction coefficient were determined to be 1.04 (Ag-SiO2):1.14 (HAp) and 0.247 +- 0.012 (Ag-SiO2) and 0.397 +- 0.034 (HAp), respectively. The chemical data showed that the release of the metal, mainly Ni from the covered NiTi substrate or Ag from Ag-SiO2 coating had a negligible effect. It was revealed that the NiTi alloy that was coated with Ag-SiO2 did not favor the formation of E. coli or S. aureus biofilm compared to the HAp-coated alloy. Moreover, both approaches to surface functionalization indicated good viability of the normal human dermal fibroblast and osteoblast cells and confirmed the high osteoconductive features of the biomaterial. The similarities of both types of coat-forming materials indicate an excellent potential of the silver-silica composite as a new material for the functionalization of the surface of a biomaterial and the development of a new type of functionalized implants.
33419132/Cudratricusxanthone A Inhibits Lipid Accumulation and Expression of Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes Cudratricusxanthone A (CTXA) is a natural bioactive compound extracted from the roots of Cudrania tricuspidata Bureau and has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and hepatoprotective activities. However, at present, anti-adipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of CTXA on adipocytes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of CTXA on lipid accumulation and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, two known inflammatory enzymes, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Strikingly, CTXA at 10 microM markedly inhibited lipid accumulation and reduced triglyceride (TG) content during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation with no cytotoxicity. On mechanistic levels, CTXA at 10 microM suppressed not only expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and perilipin A, but also phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) and STAT-5 during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. In addition, CTXA at 10 microM up-regulated phosphorylation levels of cAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) while down-regulating expression and phosphorylation levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Moreover, CTXA at 10 microM greatly attenuated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced expression of iNOS, but not COX-2, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These results collectively demonstrate that CTXA has strong anti-adipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects on 3T3-L1 cells through control of the expression and phosphorylation levels of C/EBP-alpha, PPAR-gamma, FAS, ACC, perilipin A, STAT-3/5, AMPK, and iNOS.
33419226/Reduced Graphene Oxides Modulate the Expression of Cell Receptors and Voltage-Dependent Ion Channel Genes of Glioblastoma Multiforme The development of nanotechnology based on graphene and its derivatives has aroused great scientific interest because of their unusual properties. Graphene (GN) and its derivatives, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), exhibit antitumor effects on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells in vitro. The antitumor activity of rGO with different contents of oxygen-containing functional groups and GN was compared. Using FTIR (fourier transform infrared) analysis, the content of individual functional groups (GN/exfoliation (ExF), rGO/thermal (Term), rGO/ammonium thiosulphate (ATS), and rGO/ thiourea dioxide (TUD)) was determined. Cell membrane damage, as well as changes in the cell membrane potential, was analyzed. Additionally, the gene expression of voltage-dependent ion channels (clcn3, clcn6, cacna1b, cacna1d, nalcn, kcne4, kcnj10, and kcnb1) and extracellular receptors was determined. A reduction in the potential of the U87 glioma cell membrane was observed after treatment with rGO/ATS and rGO/TUD flakes. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that major changes in the expression of voltage-dependent ion channel genes were observed in clcn3, nalcn, and kcne4 after treatment with rGO/ATS and rGO/TUD flakes. Furthermore, the GN/ExF, rGO/ATS, and rGO/TUD flakes significantly reduced the expression of extracellular receptors (uPar, CD105) in U87 glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, the cytotoxic mechanism of rGO flakes may depend on the presence and types of oxygen-containing functional groups, which are more abundant in rGO compared to GN.
33419225/Transcriptome Analysis and Identification of Lipid Genes in Physaria lindheimeri, a Genetic Resource for Hydroxy Fatty Acids in Seed Oil Hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) have numerous industrial applications but are absent in most vegetable oils. Physaria lindheimeri accumulating 85% HFA in its seed oil makes it a valuable resource for engineering oilseed crops for HFA production. To discover lipid genes involved in HFA synthesis in P. lindheimeri, transcripts from developing seeds at various stages, as well as leaf and flower buds, were sequenced. Ninety-seven percent clean reads from 552,614,582 raw reads were assembled to 129,633 contigs (or transcripts) which represented 85,948 unique genes. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that 60% of the contigs matched proteins involved in biological process, cellular component or molecular function, while the remaining matched unknown proteins. We identified 42 P. lindheimeri genes involved in fatty acid and seed oil biosynthesis, and 39 of them shared 78-100% nucleotide identity with Arabidopsis orthologs. We manually annotated 16 key genes and 14 of them contained full-length protein sequences, indicating high coverage of clean reads to the assembled contigs. A detailed profiling of the 16 genes revealed various spatial and temporal expression patterns. The further comparison of their protein sequences uncovered amino acids conserved among HFA-producing species, but these varied among non-HFA-producing species. Our findings provide essential information for basic and applied research on HFA biosynthesis.
33430194/Development of a Sensitive Self-Powered Glucose Biosensor Based on an Enzymatic Biofuel Cell Biofuel cells allow for constructing sensors that leverage the specificity of enzymes without the need for an external power source. In this work, we design a self-powered glucose sensor based on a biofuel cell. The redox enzymes glucose dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH), glucose oxidase (GOx), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were immobilized as biocatalysts on the electrodes, which were previously engineered using carbon nanostructures, including multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Additional polymers were also introduced to improve biocatalyst immobilization. The reported design offers three main advantages: (i) by using glucose as the substrate for the both anode and cathode, a more compact and robust design is enabled, (ii) the system operates under air-saturating conditions, with no need for gas purge, and (iii) the combination of carbon nanostructures and a multi-enzyme cascade maximizes the sensitivity of the biosensor. Our design allows the reliable detection of glucose in the range of 0.1-7.0 mM, which is perfectly suited for common biofluids and industrial food samples.
33430287/Lectin and E. coli Binding to Carbohydrate-Functionalized Oligo(ethylene glycol)-Based Microgels: Effect of Elastic Modulus, Crosslinker and Carbohydrate Density The synthesis of carbohydrate-functionalized biocompatible poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate microgels and the analysis of the specific binding to concanavalin A (ConA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) is shown. By using different crosslinkers, the microgels' size, density and elastic modulus were varied. Given similar mannose (Man) functionalization degrees, the softer microgels show increased ConA uptake, possibly due to increased ConA diffusion in the less dense microgel network. Furthermore, although the microgels did not form clusters with E. coli in solution, surfaces coated with mannose-functionalized microgels are shown to bind the bacteria whereas galactose (Gal) and unfunctionalized microgels show no binding. While ConA binding depends on the overall microgels' density and Man functionalization degree, E. coli binding to microgels' surfaces appears to be largely unresponsive to changes of these parameters, indicating a rather promiscuous surface recognition and sufficiently strong anchoring to few surface-exposed Man units. Overall, these results indicate that carbohydrate-functionalized biocompatible oligo(ethylene glycol)-based microgels are able to immobilize carbohydrate binding pathogens specifically and that the binding of free lectins can be controlled by the network density.
33510841/Catalpol-Induced AMPK Activation Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity through the Mitochondrial-Dependent Pathway without Compromising Its Anticancer Properties Nephrotoxicity is a common complication of cisplatin chemotherapy and, thus, limits the clinical application of cisplatin. In this work, the effects of catalpol (CAT), a bioactive ingredient extracted from Rehmannia glutinosa, on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and antitumor efficacy were comprehensively investigated. Specifically, the protective effect of CAT on cisplatin-induced injury was explored in mice and HK-2 cells. In vivo, CAT administration strikingly suppressed cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction, morphology damage, apoptosis, and inflammation. In vitro, CAT induced activation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate- (AMP-) activated protein kinase (AMPK), improved mitochondrial function, and decreased generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to a reduction in inflammation and apoptosis, which ultimately protected from cisplatin-induced injury. However, the beneficial effects of CAT were mostly blocked by coincubation with compound C. Furthermore, molecular docking results indicated that CAT had a higher affinity for AMPK than other AMPK activators such as danthron, phenformin, and metformin. Importantly, CAT possessed the ability to reverse drug resistance without compromising the antitumor properties of cisplatin. These findings suggest that CAT exerts positive effects against cisplatin-induced renal injury through reversing drug resistance via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway without affecting the anticancer activity of cisplatin.
33510843/Cardiac Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, Nrf2 Expression, and Coagulation Events in Mice with Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with cardiovascular dysfunction. Dietary adenine intake in mice is also known to induce CKD. However, in this experimental model, the mechanisms underlying the cardiotoxicity and coagulation disturbances are not fully understood. Here, we evaluated cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and coagulation events in mice with adenine (0.2% w/w in feed for 4 weeks)-induced CKD. Control mice were fed with normal chow for the same duration. Adenine increased water intake, urine output, relative kidney weight, the plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine, and the urinary concentrations of kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. It also decreased the body weight and creatinine clearance, and caused kidney DNA damage. Renal histological analysis showed tubular dilation and damage and neutrophilic influx. Adenine induced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure and the concentrations of troponin I, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1beta in heart homogenates. It also augmented the levels of markers of lipid peroxidation measured by malondialdehyde production and 8-isoprostane, as well as the antioxidants superoxide dismutase and catalase. Immunohistochemical analysis of the hearts showed that adenine increased the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 by cardiomyocytes. It also caused cardiac DNA damage. Moreover, compared with the control group, adenine induced a significant increase in the number of circulating platelet and shortened the thrombotic occlusion time in pial arterioles and venules in vivo, and induced a significant reduction in the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. In conclusion, the administration of adenine in mice induced CKD-associated cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, Nrf2 expression, and DNA damage. It also induced prothrombotic events in vivo. Therefore, this model can be satisfactorily used to study the cardiac pathophysiological events in subjects with CKD and the effect of drug treatment thereon.
33440910/Nanoindentation of Graphene/Phospholipid Nanocomposite: A Molecular Dynamics Study Graphene and phospholipids are widely used in biosensing and drug delivery. This paper studies the mechanical and electronic properties of a composite based on two graphene flakes and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipid molecules located between them via combination of various mathematical modeling methods. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that an adhesion between bilayer graphene and DPCC increases during nanoindentation of the composite by a carbon nanotube (CNT). Herewith, the DPPC molecule located under a nanotip takes the form of graphene and is not destroyed. By the Mulliken procedure, it was shown that the phospholipid molecules act as a "buffer" of charge between two graphene sheets and CNT. The highest values of electron transfer in the graphene/DPPC system were observed at the lower indentation point, when the deflection reached its maximum value.
33435538/Application of Octanohydroxamic Acid for Salting out Liquid-Liquid Extraction of Materials for Energy Storage in Supercapacitors Abstract The ability to achieve high areal capacitance for oxide-based supercapacitor electrodes with high active mass loadings is critical for practical applications. This paper reports the feasibility of the fabrication of Mn3O4-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites by the new salting-out method, which allows direct particle transfer from an aqueous synthesis medium to a 2-propanol suspension for the fabrication of advanced Mn3O4-MWCNT electrodes for supercapacitors. The electrodes show enhanced capacitive performance at high active mass loading due to reduced particle agglomeration and enhanced mixing of the Mn3O4 particles and conductive MWCNT additives. The strategy is based on the multifunctional properties of octanohydroxamic acid, which is used as a capping and dispersing agent for Mn3O4 synthesis and an extractor for particle transfer to the electrode processing medium. Electrochemical studies show that high areal capacitance is achieved at low electrode resistance. The electrodes with an active mass of 40.1 mg cm-2 show a capacitance of 4.3 F cm-2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. Electron microscopy studies reveal changes in electrode microstructure during charge-discharge cycling, which can explain the increase in capacitance. The salting-out method is promising for the development of advanced nanocomposites for energy storage in supercapacitors.
33435353/Biochemical Characterization and Function of Eight Microbial Type Terpene Synthases from Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii Selaginella moellendorffii is a lycophyte, a member of an ancient vascular plant lineage. Two distinct types of terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified from this species, including S. moellendorffii TPS genes (SmTPSs) and S. moellendorffii microbial TPS-like genes (SmMTPSLs). The goal of this study was to investigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-length SmMTPSL genes (SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46, and -47) were functionally characterized from S. moellendorffii. Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant SmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthase activities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when provided with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Meanwhile, SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin (ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plants response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that the terpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect on Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together, these results provide more information about the catalytic and biochemical function of SmMTPSLs in S. moellendorffii plants.
33435366/Antioxidative Effects of Chrysoeriol via Activation of the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway and Modulation of Mitochondrial Function Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell dysfunction caused by excessive oxidative damage is partly involved in age-related macular degeneration, which is among the leading causes of visual impairment in elderly people. Here, we investigated the protective role of chrysoeriol against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in RPE cells. The cellular viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial function of retinal ARPE-19 cells were monitored under oxidative stress or pre-treatment with chrysoeriol. The expression levels of mitochondrial-related genes and associated transcription factors were assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the protein expression of antioxidant signal molecules was characterized by Western blot analysis. Chrysoeriol significantly increased cell viability, reduced ROS generation, and increased the occurrence of antioxidant molecules in H2O2-treated ARPE-19 cells. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2O2-induced oxidative stress was also considerably diminished by chrysoeriol treatment, which reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and upregulated mitochondrial-associated genes and proteins. Chrysoeriol also markedly enhanced key transcription factors (Nrf2) and antioxidant-associated genes (particularly HO-1 and NQO-1). Therefore, our study confirms the protective effect of chrysoeriol against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in RPE cells, thus confirming that it may prevent mitochondrial dysfunction by upregulating antioxidant-related molecules.
33435517/GPR55 Receptor Activation by the N-Acyl Dopamine Family Lipids Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells via the Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Over-Stimulation GPR55 is a GPCR of the non-CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptor family, which is activated by lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and stimulates the proliferation of cancer cells. Anandamide, a bioactive lipid endocannabinoid, acts as a biased agonist of GPR55 and induces cancer cell death, but is unstable and psychoactive. We hypothesized that other endocannabinoids and structurally similar compounds, which are more hydrolytically stable, could also induce cancer cell death via GPR55 activation. We chemically synthesized and tested a set of fatty acid amides and esters for cell death induction via GPR55 activation. The most active compounds appeared to be N-acyl dopamines, especially N-docosahexaenoyl dopamine (DHA-DA). Using a panel of cancer cell lines and a set of receptor and intracellular signal transduction machinery inhibitors together with cell viability, Ca2+, NO, ROS (reactive oxygen species) and gene expression measurement, we showed for the first time that for these compounds, the mechanism of cell death induction differed from that published for anandamide and included neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) overstimulation with concomitant oxidative stress induction. The combination of DHA-DA with LPI, which normally stimulates cancer proliferation and is increased in cancer setting, had an increased cytotoxicity for the cancer cells indicating a therapeutic potential.
33440778/Construction of Charring-Functional Polyheptanazine towards Improvements in Flame Retardants of Polyurethane Nitrogen-containing flame retardants have been extensively applied due to their low toxicity and smoke-suppression properties; however, their poor charring ability restricts their applications. Herein, a representative nitrogen-containing flame retardant, polyheptanazine, was investigated. Two novel, cost-effective phosphorus-doped polyheptazine (PCN) and cobalt-anchored PCN (Co@PCN) flame retardants were synthesized via a thermal condensation method. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated effective doping of P into triazine. Then, flame-retardant particles were introduced into thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) using a melt-blending approach. The introduction of 3 wt% PCN and Co@PCN could remarkably suppress peak heat release rate (pHRR) (48.5% and 40.0%), peak smoke production rate (pSPR) (25.5% and 21.8%), and increasing residues (10.18 wt% 17.04 wt% and 14.08 wt%). Improvements in charring stability and flame retardancy were ascribed to the formation of P-N bonds and P=N bonds in triazine rings, which promoted the retention of P in the condensed phase, which produced additional high-quality residues.
33445584/Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase from Trypanosomes: Selectivity for Steroids and Chemical Validation in Bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) fulfills an essential role in cell physiology by catalyzing the production of NADPH+ and of a precursor for the de novo synthesis of ribose 5-phosphate. In trypanosomatids, G6PDH is essential for in vitro proliferation, antioxidant defense and, thereby, drug resistance mechanisms. So far, 16alpha-brominated epiandrosterone represents the most potent hit targeting trypanosomal G6PDH. Here, we extended the investigations on this important drug target and its inhibition by using a small subset of androstane derivatives. In Trypanosoma cruzi, immunofluorescence revealed a cytoplasmic distribution of G6PDH and the absence of signal in major organelles. Cytochemical assays confirmed parasitic G6PDH as the molecular target of epiandrosterone. Structure-activity analysis for a set of new (dehydro)epiandrosterone derivatives revealed that bromination at position 16alpha of the cyclopentane moiety yielded more potent T. cruzi G6PDH inhibitors than the corresponding beta-substituted analogues. For the 16alpha brominated compounds, the inclusion of an acetoxy group at position 3 either proved detrimental or enhanced the activity of the epiandrosterone or the dehydroepiandrosterone derivatives, respectively. Most derivatives presented single digit muM EC50 against infective T. brucei and the killing mechanism involved an early thiol-redox unbalance. This data suggests that infective African trypanosomes lack efficient NADPH+-synthesizing pathways, beyond the Pentose Phosphate, to maintain thiol-redox homeostasis.
33435516/Caffeoylquinic Acid Derivatives of Purple Sweet Potato as Modulators of Mitochondrial Function in Mouse Primary Hepatocytes Owing to their antioxidant properties, caffeoylquinic acid (CQA)-derivatives could potentially improve the impaired metabolism in hepatic cells, however, their effect on mitochondrial function has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we evaluated the impact of three CQA-derivatives extracted from purple sweet potato, namely 5-CQA, 3,4- and 4,5-diCQA, on mitochondrial activity in primary hepatocytes using an extracellular flux analyzer. Notably, an increase of maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity were observed when 5-CQA and 3,4-diCQA were added to the system indicating the improved mitochondrial function. Moreover, 3,4-diCQA was shown to considerably increase glycolytic reserve which is a measure of cell capability to respond to an energy demand through glycolysis. Conversely, 4,5-diCQA did not modify mitochondrial activity but increased glycolysis at low concentration in primary hepatocytes. All compounds tested improved cellular capacity to oxidize fatty acids. Overall, our results demonstrated the potential of test CQA-derivatives to modify mitochondrial function in hepatic cells. It is especially relevant in case of dysfunctional mitochondria in hepatocytes linked to hepatic steatosis during obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
33435504/Obacunone Attenuates Liver Fibrosis with Enhancing Anti-Oxidant Effects of GPx-4 and Inhibition of EMT Obacunone, a limonin triterpenoid extracted from Phellodendronchinense Schneid or Dictamnus dasycarpusb Turcz plant, elicits a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-oxidation, and anti-lung-fibrosis ones. However, the anti-fibrotic effect of obacunone and the detailed underlying mechanism in liver fibrosis remain unclear. Liver fibrosis is a debilitating disease threatening human health. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/P-Smad is a major pathway of fibrosis featured with epithelia mesenchymal transformations (EMT) and collagen depositions, accompanying with excessive oxygen-free radicals. Nrf-2 acts as a key anti-oxidative regulator driving the expressions of various antioxidant-related genes. Glutathionperoxidase-4 (GPx-4) is a member of the glutathione peroxidase family that directly inhibits phospholipid oxidation to alleviate oxidative stress. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role of obacunone in mouse liver fibrosis model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and in hepatic stellate cells (LX2 cell line) challenging with TGF-beta. Obacunone demonstrated potent ameliorative effects on liver fibrosis both in activated LX2 and in mice liver tissues with reduced levels of alpha-SMA, collagen1, and vimentin. Obacunone also remarkably suppressed the TGF-beta/P-Smad signals and EMT process. Meanwhile, obacunone exerted a potent anti-oxidation effect by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both models. The antioxidant effect of obacunone was attributed to the activation of GPx-4 and Nrf-2. In addition, the therapeutic effect of obacunone on LX2 cells was significantly removed in vitro plus with GPx-4 antagonist RSL3, in parallel with the re-elevated levels of ROS. Thus, we demonstrate that obacunone is able to attenuate liver fibrosis via enhancing GPx-4 signal and inhibition of the TGF-beta/P-Smad pathway and EMT process.
33435162/Bioactive Lipids of Marine Microalga Chlorococcum sp. SABC 012504 with Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Thrombotic Activities Microalgae are at the start of the food chain, and many are known producers of a significant amount of lipids with essential fatty acids. However, the bioactivity of microalgal lipids for anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities have rarely been investigated. Therefore, for a sustainable source of the above bioactive lipids, the present study was undertaken. The total lipids of microalga Chlorococcum sp., isolated from the Irish coast, were fractionated into neutral-, glyco-, and phospho-lipids, and were tested in vitro for their anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities. All tested lipid fractions showed strong anti-platelet-activating factor (PAF) and antithrombin activities in human platelets (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging ~25-200 mug of lipid) with the highest activities in glyco- and phospho-lipid fractions. The structural analysis of the bioactive lipid fraction-2 revealed the presence of specific sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SQDG) bioactive molecules and the HexCer-t36:2 (t18:1/18:1 and 18:2/18:0) cerebrosides with a phytosphingosine (4-hydrosphinganine) base, while fraction-3 contained bioactive phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules. These novel bioactive lipids of Chlorococcum sp. with putative health benefits may indicate that marine microalgae can be a sustainable alternative source for bioactive lipids production for food supplements and nutraceutical applications. However, further studies are required towards the commercial technology pathways development and biosafety analysis for the use of the microalga.
33440689/Chemosensitization of HT29 and HT29-5FU Cell Lines by a Combination of a Multi-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor and 5FU Downregulates ABCC1 and Inhibits PIK3CA in Light of Their Importance in Saudi Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the main causes of death worldwide and in Saudi Arabia. The toxicity and the development of resistance against 5 fluorouracil 5FU pose increasing therapeutic difficulties, which necessitates the development of personalized drugs and drug combinations. Objectives: First, to determine the most important kinases and kinase pathways, and the amount of ABC transporters and KRAS in samples taken from Saudi CRC patients. Second, to investigate the chemosensitizing effect of LY294002 and HAA2020 and their combinations with 5FU on HT29, HT29-5FU, HCT116, and HCT116-5FU CRC cells, their effect on the three ABC transporters, cell cycle, and apoptosis, in light of the important kinase pathways resulting from the first part of this study. Methods: The PamChip  peptide micro-array profiling was used to determine the level of kinase and targets in the Saudi CRC samples. Next, RT-PCR, MTT cytotoxicity, Western blotting, perturbation of cell cycle, annexin V, and immunofluorescence assays were used to investigate the effect on CRC, MRC5, and HUVEC cells. Results: The kinase activity profiling highlighted the importance of the PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and the growth factors pathways in the Saudi CRC samples. PIK3CA was the most overexpressed, and it was associated with increased level of mutated KRAS and the three ABC transporters, especially ABCC1 in the Saudi samples. Next, combining HAA2020 with 5FU exhibited the best synergistic and resistance-reversal effect in the four CRC cells, and the highest selectivity indices compared to MRC5 and HUVEC normal cells. Additionally, HAA2020 with 5FU exerted significant inhibition of ABCC1 in the four CRC cells, and inhibition of PIK3CA/AKT/MAPK7/ERK in HT29 and HT29-5FU cells. The combination also inhibited EGFR, increased the preG1/S cell cycle phases, apoptosis, and caspase 8 in HT29 cells, while it increased the G1 phase, p21/p27, and apoptosis in HT29-5FU cells. Conclusion: We have combined the PamChip kinase profiling of Saudi CRC samples with in vitro drug combination studies in four CRC cells, highlighting the importance of targeting PIK3CA and ABCC1 for Saudi CRC patients, especially given that the overexpression of PIK3CA mutations was previously linked with the lack of activity for the anti-EGFRs as first line treatment for CRC patients. The combination of HAA2020 and 5FU has selectively sensitized the four CRC cells to 5FU and could be further studied.
33435325/Superior Properties of N-Acetylcysteine Ethyl Ester over N-Acetyl Cysteine to Prevent Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Oxidative Damage Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathophysiology of retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy, which are the major causes of irreversible blindness in developed countries. An excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can directly cause functional and morphological impairments in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), endothelial cells, and retinal ganglion cells. Antioxidants may represent a preventive/therapeutic strategy and reduce the risk of progression of AMD. Among antioxidants, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is widely studied and has been proposed to have therapeutic benefit in treating AMD by mitigating oxidative damage in RPE. Here, we demonstrate that N-acetyl-L-cysteine ethyl ester (NACET), a lipophilic cell-permeable cysteine derivative, increases the viability in oxidative stressed RPE cells more efficiently than NAC by reacting directly and more rapidly with oxidizing agents, and that NACET, but not NAC, pretreatment predisposes RPE cells to oxidative stress resistance and increases the intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) pool available to act as natural antioxidant defense. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of NACET to increase GSH levels in rats' eyes after oral administration. In conclusion, even if experiments in AMD animal models are still needed, our data suggest that NACET may play an important role in preventing and treating retinal diseases associated with oxidative stress, and may represent a valid and more efficient alternative to NAC in therapeutic protocols in which NAC has already shown promising results. 
33435514/Probing the Binding Requirements of Modified Nucleosides with the DNA Nuclease SNM1A SNM1A is a nuclease that is implicated in DNA interstrand crosslink repair and, as such, its inhibition is of interest for overcoming resistance to chemotherapeutic crosslinking agents. However, the number and identity of the metal ion(s) in the active site of SNM1A are still unconfirmed, and only a limited number of inhibitors have been reported to date. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a family of malonate-based modified nucleosides to investigate the optimal positioning of metal-binding groups in nucleoside-derived inhibitors for SNM1A. These compounds include ester, carboxylate and hydroxamic acid malonate derivatives which were installed in the 5'-position or 3'-position of thymidine or as a linkage between two nucleosides. Evaluation as inhibitors of recombinant SNM1A showed that nine of the twelve compounds tested had an inhibitory effect at 1 mM concentration. The most potent compound contains a hydroxamic acid malonate group at the 5'-position. Overall, our studies advance the understanding of requirements for nucleoside-derived inhibitors for SNM1A and indicate that groups containing a negatively charged group in close proximity to a metal chelator, such as hydroxamic acid malonates, are promising structures in the design of inhibitors.
33435417/2-(2-Methyl-2-nitrovinyl)furan but Not Furvina Interfere with Staphylococcus aureus Agr Quorum-Sensing System and Potentiate the Action of Fusidic Acid against Biofilms Quorum sensing (QS) plays an essential role in the production of virulence factors, in biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance. Consequently, inhibiting QS is being considered a promising target for antipathogenic/anti-virulence therapies. This study aims to screen 2-nitrovinylfuran derivatives structurally related to Furvina (a broad-spectrum antibiotic already used for therapeutic purposes) for their effects on QS and in biofilm prevention/control. Furvina and four 2-nitrovinylfuran derivatives (compounds 1-4) were tested to assess the ability to interfere with QS of Staphylococcus aureus using bioreporter strains (S. aureus ALC1742 and ALC1743). The activity of Furvina and the most promising quorum-sensing inhibitor (QSI) was evaluated in biofilm prevention and in biofilm control (combined with fusidic acid). The biofilms were further characterized in terms of biofilm mass, viability and membrane integrity. Compound 2 caused the most significant QS inhibition with reductions between 60% and 80%. Molecular docking simulations indicate that this compound interacts preferentially with the protein hydrophobic cleft in the LytTR domain of AgrA pocket. Metabolic inactivations of 40% for S. aureus ALC1742 and 20% for S. aureus ALC1743 were reached. A 24 h-old biofilm formed in the presence of the QSI increased the metabolic inactivation by fusidic acid to 80%, for both strains. The overall results highlight the effects of compound 2 as well as the potential of combining QSI with in-use antibiotics for the management of skin and soft tissues infections.
33445440/Catalytic Conversion of Glucose into Levulinic Acid Using 2-Phenyl-2-Imidazoline Based Ionic Liquid Catalyst Levulinic acid (LA) is an industrially important product that can be catalytically valorized into important value-added chemicals. In this study, hydrothermal conversion of glucose into levulinic acid was attempted using Bronsted acidic ionic liquid catalyst synthesized using 2-phenyl-2-imidazoline, and 2-phenyl-2-imidazoline-based ionic liquid catalyst used in this study was synthesized in the laboratory using different anions (NO3, H2PO4, and Cl) and characterized using 1H NMR, TGA, and FT-IR spectroscopic techniques. The activity trend of the Bronsted acidic ionic liquid catalysts synthesized in the laboratory was found in the following order: [C4SO3HPhim][Cl] > [C4SO3HPhim][NO3] > [C4SO3HPhim][H2PO4]. A maximum 63% yield of the levulinic acid was obtained with 98% glucose conversion at 180  C and 3 h reaction time using [C4SO3HPhim][Cl] ionic liquid catalyst. The effect of different reaction conditions such as reaction time, temperature, ionic liquid catalyst structures, catalyst amount, and solvents on the LA yield were investigated. Reusability of [C4SO3HPhim][Cl] catalyst up to four cycles was observed. This study demonstrates the potential of the 2-phenyl-2-imidazoline-based ionic liquid for the conversion of glucose into the important platform chemical levulinic acid.
33435558/Protective Effects of Polyphenol Enriched Complex Plants Extract on Metabolic Dysfunctions Associated with Obesity and Related Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases in High Fat Diet-Induced C57BL/6 Mice Background: Currently, obesity is a global health challenge due to its increasing prevalence and associated health risk. It is associated with various metabolic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, certain forms of cancer, and non-alcoholic liver diseases (NAFLD). Objective: The aim of this study to evaluate the effects of polyphenol enriched herbal complex (Rubus crataegifolius/ellagic acid, Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge/vitexin, chlorogenic acid, Cinnamomum cassiaa/cinnamic acid) on obesity and obesity induced NAFLD in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Methods: Obesity was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using HFD. After 8 weeks, the mice were treated with HFD+ plants extract for 8 weeks. Body weight, food intake weekly, and blood sugar level were measured. After sacrifice, changes in the treated group's liver weight, fat weight, serum biochemical parameters, hormone levels, and enzyme levels were measured. For histological analysis, tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Oil Red-O. Results: Our results showed that the herbal complex ameliorated body weight and liver weight gain, and decreased total body fat in HFD-fed animals. Post prandial blood glucose (PBG) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were lower in the herbal complex-treated group than in the HFD control group. Additionally, herbal formulation treatment significantly increased HDL levels in serum and decreased TC, TG, AST, ALT, deposition of fat droplets in the liver, and intima media thickness (IMT) in the aorta. Herbal complex increased serum adiponectin and decreased serum leptin. Herbal complex also increased carnitine palmityl transferase (CPT) activity and significantly decreased enzyme activity of beta-hydroxy beta methyl glutamyl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that the herbal complex is an effective herbal formulation in the attenuation of obesity and obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction including NAFLD in HFD-induced mouse model.
33445611/Cytokinin Plant Hormones Have Neuroprotective Activity in In Vitro Models of Parkinson's Disease Cytokinins are adenine-based phytohormones that regulate key processes in plants, such as cell division and differentiation, root and shoot growth, apical dominance, branching, and seed germination. In preliminary studies, they have also shown protective activities against human neurodegenerative diseases. To extend knowledge of the protection (protective activity) they offer, we investigated activities of natural cytokinins against salsolinol (SAL)-induced toxicity (a Parkinson's disease model) and glutamate (Glu)-induced death of neuron-like dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. We found that kinetin-3-glucoside, cis-zeatin riboside, and N6-isopentenyladenosine were active in the SAL-induced PD model. In addition, trans-, cis-zeatin, and kinetin along with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) and the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin 1 (NEC-1) significantly reduced cell death rates in the Glu-induced model. Lactate dehydrogenase assays revealed that the cytokinins provided lower neuroprotective activity than DFO and NEC-1. Moreover, they reduced apoptotic caspase-3/7 activities less strongly than DFO. However, the cytokinins had very similar effects to DFO and NEC-1 on superoxide radical production. Overall, they showed protective activity in the SAL-induced model of parkinsonian neuronal cell death and Glu-induced model of oxidative damage mainly by reduction of oxidative stress.
33435350/Rethinking the Citric Acid Cycle: Connecting Pyruvate Carboxylase and Citrate Synthase to the Flow of Energy and Material In 1937, Sir H. A Krebs first published the Citric Acid Cycle, a unidirectional cycle with carboxylic acids. The original concept of the Citric Acid Cycle from Krebs' 1953 Nobel Prize lecture illustrates the unidirectional degradation of lactic acid to water, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Here, we add the heart lactate dehydrogenase proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter 1 complex, connecting the original Citric Acid Cycle to the flow of energy and material. The heart lactate dehydrogenase proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter 1 complex catalyses the first reaction of the Citric Acid Cycle, the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, and thus secures the provision of pyruvic acid. In addition, we modify Krebs' original concept by feeding the cycle with oxaloacetic acid. Our concept enables the integration of anabolic processes and allows adaption of the organism to recover ATP faster.
33440755/Spectroelectrochemical Properties and Catalytic Activity in Cyclohexane Oxidation of the Hybrid Zr/Hf-Phthalocyaninate-Capped Nickel(II) and Iron(II) tris-Pyridineoximates and Their Precursors The in situ spectroelectrochemical cyclic voltammetric studies of the antimony-monocapped nickel(II) and iron(II) tris-pyridineoximates with a labile triethylantimony cross-linking group and Zr(IV)/Hf(IV) phthalocyaninate complexes were performed in order to understand the nature of the redox events in the molecules of heterodinuclear zirconium(IV) and hafnium(IV) phthalocyaninate-capped derivatives. Electronic structures of their 1e-oxidized and 1e-electron-reduced forms were experimentally studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and UV-vis-near-IR spectroelectrochemical experiments and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The investigated hybrid molecular systems that combine a transition metal (pseudo)clathrochelate and a Zr/Hf-phthalocyaninate moiety exhibit quite rich redox activity both in the cathodic and in the anodic region. These binuclear compounds and their precursors were tested as potential catalysts in oxidation reactions of cyclohexane and the results are discussed.
33435343/Formation and Stabilization of W1/O/W2 Emulsions with Gelled Lipid Phases Water-in-oil-in-water (W1/O/W2) emulsions are emulsion-based systems where the dispersed phase is an emulsion itself, offering great potential for the encapsulation of hydrophilic bioactive compounds. However, their formation and stabilization is still a challenge mainly due to water migration, which could be reduced by lipid phase gelation. This study aimed to assess the impact of lipid phase state being liquid or gelled using glyceryl stearate (GS) at 1% (w/w) as well as the hydrophilic emulsifier (T80: Tween 80 or lecithin) and the oil type (MCT:medium chain triglyceride or corn oil (CO) as long chain triglyceride) on the formation and stabilization of chlorophyllin W1/O/W2 emulsions. Their colloidal stability against temperature and light exposure conditions was evaluated. Gelling both lipid phases (MCT and CO) rendered smaller W1 droplets during the first emulsification step, followed by formation of W1/O/W2 emulsions with smaller W1/O droplet size and more stable against clarification. The stability of W1/O/W2 emulsions was sensitive to a temperature increase, which might be related to the lower gelling degree of the lipid phase at higher temperatures. This study provides valuable insight for the formation and stabilization of W1/O/W2 emulsions with gelled lipid phases as delivery systems of hydrophilic bioactive compounds under common food storage conditions.
33440748/Equilibrium and Kinetic Study of l- and d-Valine Adsorption in Supramolecular-Templated Chiral Mesoporous Materials Adsorption kinetic studies are conducted to investigate the potential to use chiral mesoporous materials nanoporous guanosine monophosphate material-1 (NGM-1) and nanoporous folic acid material-1 (NFM-1) for the enantiomeric separation of l- and d-valine. A pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic model is applied to test the experimental adsorption equilibrium isotherms, according to both the Langmuir and Freundlich models and the characteristic parameters for each model are determined. The calcined versions of both NGM-1 and NFM-1 fit the Langmuir model with maximum sorption capacities of 0.36 and 0.26 g/g for the preferred adsorption enantiomers, d-valine and l-valine, respectively. Experimental results and the analysis of adsorption models suggest a strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction, and the formation of a monolayer of tightly packed amino acid on the internal mesopore surface for the preferred enantiomers.
33435534/Anisotropic Photoluminescence of Poly(3-hexyl thiophene) and Their Composites with Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Highly Separated in Metallic and Semiconducting Tubes In this work, the effect of the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as the mixtures of metallic and semiconducting tubes (M + S-SWNTs) as well as highly separated semiconducting (S-SWNTs) and metallic (M-SWNTs) tubes on the photoluminescence (PL) of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) was reported. Two methods were used to prepare such composites, that is, the chemical interaction of the two constituents and the electrochemical polymerization of the 3-hexyl thiophene onto the rough Au supports modified with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The measurements of the anisotropic PL of these composites have highlighted a significant diminution of the angle of the binding of the P3HT films electrochemical synthetized onto Au electrodes covered with M + S-SWNTs. This change was attributed to metallic tubes, as was demonstrated using the anisotropic PL measurements carried out on the P3HT/M-SWNTs and P3HT/S-SWNTs composites. Small variations in the angle of the binding were reported in the case of the composites prepared by chemical interaction of the two constituents. The proposed mechanism to explain this behavior took into account the functionalization process of CNTs with P3HT. The experimental arguments of the functionalization process of CNTs with P3HT were shown by the UV-VIS-NIR and FTIR spectroscopy as well as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). A PL quenching process of P3HT induced both in the presence of S-SWNTs and M-SWNTs was reported, too. This process origins in the various de-excitation pathways which can be developed considering the energy levels diagram of the two constituents of each studied composite.
33430124/Rare Chromone Derivatives from the Marine-Derived Penicillium citrinum with Anti-Cancer and Anti-Inflammatory Activities Three new and rare chromone derivatives, epiremisporine C (1), epiremisporine D (2), and epiremisporine E (3), were isolated from marine-derived Penicillium citrinum, together with four known compounds, epiremisporine B (4), penicitrinone A (5), 8-hydroxy-1-methoxycarbonyl-6-methylxanthone (6), and isoconiochaetone C (7). Among the isolated compounds, compounds 2-5 significantly decreased fMLP-induced superoxide anion generation by human neutrophils, with IC50 values of 6.39 +- 0.40, 8.28 +- 0.29, 3.62 +- 0.61, and 2.67 +- 0.10 muM, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 exhibited cytotoxic activities with IC50 values of 43.82 +- 6.33 and 32.29 +- 4.83 muM, respectively, against non-small lung cancer cell (A549), and Western blot assay confirmed that compounds 3 and 4 markedly induced apoptosis of A549 cells, through Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase 3 signaling cascades.
33435546/Artificial Caries Lesion Characteristics after Secondary Demineralization with Theobromine-Containing Protocol Developing artificial caries lesions with varying characteristics is needed to adequately study caries process in vitro. The objective of this study was to investigate artificial caries lesion characteristics after secondary demineralization protocol containing theobromine and fluoride. Sixty bovine enamel slabs (4 x 3 mm) were demineralized using a Carbopol-containing protocol for 6 days. A baseline area (2 x 3 mm) was protected with acid-resistant nail varnish, after which specimens were exposed for 24 h to a secondary demineralization protocol containing acetic acid plus one of four fluoride/theobromine combinations (n = 15): theobromine (50 or 200 ppm) and fluoride (0 or 1 ppm). Specimens were sectioned and analyzed using transverse microradiography for changes in mineral content, lesion depth, and surface layer mineralization. Data was analyzed using paired t-test and analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni test at 0.05 significance level. After secondary demineralization, fluoride-containing groups had significantly deeper lesions (p = 0.002 and 0.014) compared to the group with 0 ppm fluoride and 50 ppm theobromine. Mineral content and lesion depth were significantly different compared to baseline for all groups. Theobromine did not show an added effect on mineral uptake. Theobromine-containing groups exhibited particularly deep lesions with a more uniform mineral profile in the presence of fluoride.
33435380/Libertellenone H, a Natural Pimarane Diterpenoid, Inhibits Thioredoxin System and Induces ROS-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells Libertellenone H (LH), a marine-derived pimarane diterpenoid isolated from arctic fungus Eutypella sp. D-1, has shown effective cytotoxicity on a range of cancer cells. The present study is to explore the anticancer effect of LH on human pancreatic cancer cells and to investigate the intracellular molecular target and underlying mechanism. As shown, LH exhibited anticancer activity in human pancreatic cancer cells by promoting cell apoptosis. Mechanistic studies suggested that LH-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was responsible for apoptosis as antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) antagonized the inhibitory effect of LH. Zymologic testing demonstrated that LH inhibited Trx system but had little effect on the glutathione reductase and glutaredoxin. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that the mechanism of action was based on the direct conjugation of LH to the Cys32/Cys35 residue of Trx1 and Sec498 of TrxR, leading to a decrease in the cellular level of glutathione (GSH) and activation of downstream ASK1/JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings revealed LH was a marine derived inhibitor of Trx system and an anticancer candidate.
33430517/Kinetic Behavior of Quaternary Ammonium Hydroxides in Mixed Methane and Carbon Dioxide Hydrates This study evaluates the kinetic hydrate inhibition (KHI) performance of four quaternary ammonium hydroxides (QAH) on mixed CH4 + CO2 hydrate systems. The studied QAHs are; tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH), and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPrAOH). The test was performed in a high-pressure hydrate reactor at temperatures of 274.0 K and 277.0 K, and a concentration of 1 wt.% using the isochoric cooling method. The kinetics results suggest that all the QAHs potentially delayed mixed CH4 + CO2 hydrates formation due to their steric hindrance abilities. The presence of QAHs reduced hydrate formation risk than the conventional hydrate inhibitor, PVP, at higher subcooling conditions. The findings indicate that increasing QAHs alkyl chain lengths increase their kinetic hydrate inhibition efficacies due to better surface adsorption abilities. QAHs with longer chain lengths have lesser amounts of solute particles to prevent hydrate formation. The outcomes of this study contribute significantly to current efforts to control gas hydrate formation in offshore petroleum pipelines.
33430495/A QuEChERS-HPLC-MS/MS Method with Matrix Matching Calibration Strategy for Determination of Imidacloprid and Its Metabolites in Procambarus clarkii (Crayfish) Tissues We developed a method for determination of imidacloprid and its metabolites 5-hydroxy imidacloprid, olefin imidacloprid, imidacloprid urea and 6-chloronicotinic acid in Procambarus clarkii (crayfish) tissues using quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Samples (plasma, cephalothorax, hepatopancrea, gill, intestine, and muscle) were extracted with acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid and cleaned up using a neutral alumina column containing a primary secondary amine. The prepared samples were separated using reverse phase chromatography and scanned in the positive and negative ion multiple reaction-monitoring modes. Under the optimum experimental conditions, spiked recoveries for these compounds in P. clarkii samples ranged from 80.6 to 112.7% with relative standard deviations of 4.2 to 12.6%. The limits of detection were 0.02-0.5 mug L-1, the limits of quantification were 0.05-2.0 mug L-1 and the method of quantification was 0.05-2.0 mug kg-1. The method is rapid, simple, sensitive and suitable for rapid determination and analysis of imidacloprid and its metabolites in P. clarkii tissues.
33445600/Homobivalent Lamellarin-Like Schiff Bases: In Vitro Evaluation of Their Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity and Multitargeting Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Potential Marine alkaloids belonging to the lamellarins family, which incorporate a 5,6-dihydro-1-phenylpyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline (DHPPIQ) moiety, possess various biological activities, spanning from antiviral and antibiotic activities to cytotoxicity against tumor cells and the reversal of multidrug resistance. Expanding a series of previously reported imino adducts of DHPPIQ 2-carbaldehyde, novel aliphatic and aromatic Schiff bases were synthesized and evaluated herein for their cytotoxicity in five diverse tumor cell lines. Most of the newly synthesized compounds were found noncytotoxic in the low micromolar range (<30 muM). Based on a Multi-fingerprint Similarity Search aLgorithm (MuSSeL), mainly conceived for making protein drug target prediction, some DHPPIQ derivatives, especially bis-DHPPIQ Schiff bases linked by a phenylene bridge, were prioritized as potential hits addressing Alzheimer's disease-related target proteins, such as cholinesterases (ChEs) and monoamine oxidases (MAOs). In agreement with MuSSeL predictions, homobivalent para-phenylene DHPPIQ Schiff base 14 exhibited a noncompetitive/mixed inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with Ki in the low micromolar range (4.69 muM). Interestingly, besides a certain inhibition of MAO A (50% inhibition of the cell population growth (IC50) = 12 muM), the bis-DHPPIQ 14 showed a good inhibitory activity on self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta)1-40 aggregation (IC50 = 13 muM), which resulted 3.5-fold stronger than the respective mono-DHPPIQ Schiff base 9.
33440878/Effect of Hydrolyzable Tannins on Glucose-Transporter Expression and Their Bioavailability in Pig Small-Intestinal 3D Cell Model Intestinal transepithelial transport of glucose is mediated by glucose transporters, and affects postprandial blood-glucose levels. This study investigates the effect of wood extracts rich in hydrolyzable tannins (HTs) that originated from sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) and oak (Quercus petraea) on the expression of glucose transporter genes and the uptake of glucose and HT constituents in a 3D porcine-small-intestine epithelial-cell model. The viability of epithelial cells CLAB and PSI exposed to different HTs was determined using alamarBlue . qPCR was used to analyze the gene expression of SGLT1, GLUT2, GLUT4, and POLR2A. Glucose uptake was confirmed by assay, and LC-MS/ MS was used for the analysis of HT bioavailability. HTs at 37 microg/mL were found to adversely affect cell viability and downregulate POLR2A expression. HT from wood extract Tanex at concentrations of 4 microg/mL upregulated the expression of GLUT2, as well as glucose uptake at 1 microg/mL. The time-dependent passage of gallic acid through enterocytes was influenced by all wood extracts compared to gallic acid itself as a control. These results suggest that HTs could modulate glucose uptake and gallic acid passage in the 3D cell model.
33429926/Synergistic Effect of Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles and Natural Phenolic Compounds against Drug-Resistant Fish Pathogens and Their Cytotoxicity: An In Vitro Study Fish pathogens causing disease outbreaks represent a major threat to aquaculture industry and food security. The aim of the presented study is to develop safe and effective bioactive agents against two bacterial isolates: Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens. We employed a broth microdilution method to investigate the antibacterial effect of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs); rutin, a natural flavonoid extracted from Ruta graveneoles; and heliomycin, a secondary metabolite produced by marine actinomycetes AB5, as monotherapeutic agents. Moreover, AgNPs in combination with rutin (AgNP + R) and heliomycin (AgNPs + H) were examined for their synergistic effect. The cytotoxic effect of individual bioactive compounds and in combination with AgNPs was investigated on epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) fish cell lines. Individual treatment of AgNPs, rutin, and heliomycin exhibited a dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens. Rutin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed the lowest cytotoxicity when tested on EPC cell lines, while heliomycin MIC was highly cytotoxic. Combined subtherapeutic doses of AgNPs + R and AgNPs + H displayed additive and synergistic effects against A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens, respectively, with improved results and relative safety profile. The study findings demonstrate that a combination of AgNPs and natural bioactive compounds may represent novel therapeutics fighting fish pathogens potentially affecting the fish farming industry.
33435383/Effectiveness of Chitosan as a Dietary Supplement in Lowering Cholesterol in Murine Models: A Meta-Analysis This study presents a meta-analysis of studies that investigate the effectiveness of chitosan administration on lifestyle-related disease in murine models. A total of 34 published studies were used to evaluate the effect of chitosan supplementation. The effect sizes for various items after chitosan administration were evaluated using the standardized mean difference. Using Cochran's Q test, the heterogeneity of effect sizes was assessed, after which a meta-ANOVA and -regression test was conducted to explain the heterogeneity of effect sizes using the mixed-effect model. Publication bias was performed using Egger's linear regression test. Among the items evaluated, blood triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol showed the highest heterogeneity, respectively. Other than blood HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride in feces, most items evaluated showed a negative effect size with high significance in the fixed- and random-effect model (p < 0.0001). In the meta-ANOVA and -regression test, administering chitosan and resistant starch was revealed to be most effective in lowering body weight. In addition, chitosan supplementation proved to be an effective solution for serum TNF-alpha inhibition. In conclusion, chitosan has been shown to be somewhat useful in improving symptoms of lifestyle-related disease. Although there are some limitations in the results of this meta-analysis due to the limited number of animal experiments conducted, chitosan administration nevertheless shows promise in reducing the risk of cholesterol related metabolic disorder.
33435602/Investigation of Solubility Behavior of Canagliflozin Hydrate Crystals Combining Crystallographic and Hirshfeld Surface Calculations Canagliflozin (CG) was a highly effective, selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The crystal structure of CG monohydrate (CG-H2O) was reported for the first time while CG hemihydrate (CG-Hemi) had been reported in our previous research. Solubility and dissolution rate results showed that the solubility of CG-Hemi was 1.4 times higher than that of CG-H2O in water and hydrochloric acid solution, and the dissolution rates of CG-Hemi were more than 3 folds than CG-H2O in both solutions. Hirshfeld surface analysis showed that CG-H2O had stronger intermolecular forces than CG-Hemi, and water molecules in CG-H2O participated three hydrogen bonds, forming hydrogen bond networks. These crystal structure features might make it more difficult for solvent molecules to dissolve CG-H2O than CG-Hemi. All these analyses might explain why the dissolution performance of CG-Hemi was better than CG-H2O. This work provided an approach to predict the dissolution performance of the drug based on its crystal structure.
33430409/Development and Validation of a Method for Determining the Quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and Ellagic Acid Content of Common Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis) by HPLC-UVD Toward the standardization of common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) sprout extract (OBS-E), we aimed to obtain indicator compounds and use a validated method. HPLC-UVD allowed simultaneous quantification of the indicator compounds quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and ellagic acid. The method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and limit of detection/limit of quantification (LOD/LOQ). High specificity and linearity was demonstrated, with correlation coefficients of 1.0000 for quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and 0.9998 for ellagic acid. The LOD/LOQ values were 0.486/1.472 mug/mL for quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and 1.003/3.039 mug/mL for ellagic acid. Intra-day and inter-day variability tests produced relative standard deviation for each compound of <2%, a generally accepted precision criterion. High recovery rate were also obtained, indicating accuracy validation. The OBS-E prepared using various concentrations of ethanol were then analyzed. The 50% ethanol extract had highest content of quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, whereas the 70% ethanol extract possessed the lowest. However, the ellagic acid content was highest in the 70% ethanol extract and lowest in the 90% ethanol extract. Thus, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and ellagic acid can be used industrially as indicator compounds for O. biennis sprout products, and our validated method can be used to establish indicator compounds for other natural products.
33435511/Effectiveness of Columbianadin, a Bioactive Coumarin Derivative, in Perturbing Transient and Persistent INa Columbianadin (CBN) is a bioactive coumarin-type compound with various biological activities. However, the action of CBN on the ionic mechanism remains largely uncertain, albeit it was reported to inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ current or to modulate TRP-channel activity. In this study, whole-cell patch-clamp current recordings were undertaken to explore the modifications of CBN or other related compounds on ionic currents in excitable cells (e.g., pituitary GH3 cells and HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes). GH3-cell exposure to CBN differentially decreased peak or late component of voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) with effective IC50 of 14.7 or 2.8 microM, respectively. The inactivation time course of INa activated by short depolarization became fastened in the presence of CBN with estimated KD value of 3.15 microM. The peak INa diminished by 10 microM CBN was further suppressed by subsequent addition of either sesamin (10 microM), ranolazine (10 microM), or tetrodotoxin (1 microM), but it was reversed by 10 microM tefluthrin (Tef); however, further application of 10 microM nimodipine failed to alter CBN-mediated inhibition of INa. CBN (10 microM) shifted the midpoint of inactivation curve of INa to the leftward direction. The CBN-mediated inhibition of peak INa exhibited tonic and use-dependent characteristics. Using triangular ramp pulse, the hysteresis of persistent INa enhanced by Tef was noticed, and the behavior was attenuated by subsequent addition of CBN. The delayed-rectifier or erg-mediated K+ current was mildly inhibited by 10 microM CBN, while it also slightly inhibited the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current. In HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes, CBN inhibited peak INa and raised the inactivation rate of the current; moreover, further application of 10 microM Tef attenuated CBN-mediated decrease in INa. Collectively, this study provides an important yet unidentified finding revealing that CBN modifies INa in electrically excitable cells.
33435361/Comparison of Light Condition-Dependent Differences in the Accumulation and Subcellular Localization of Glutathione in Arabidopsis and Wheat This study aimed to clarify whether the light condition-dependent changes in the redox state and subcellular distribution of glutathione were similar in the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis (wild-type, ascorbate- and glutathione-deficient mutants) and the monocotyledonous crop species wheat (Chinese Spring variety). With increasing light intensity, the amount of its reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) form and the GSSG/GSH ratio increased in the leaf extracts of both species including all genotypes, while far-red light increased these parameters only in wheat except for GSH in the GSH-deficient Arabidopsis mutant. Based on the expression changes of the glutathione metabolism-related genes, light intensity influences the size and redox state of the glutathione pool at the transcriptional level in wheat but not in Arabidopsis. In line with the results in leaf extracts, a similar inducing effect of both light intensity and far-red light was found on the total glutathione content at the subcellular level in wheat. In contrast to the leaf extracts, the inducing influence of light intensity on glutathione level was only found in the cell compartments of the GSH-deficient Arabidopsis mutant, and far-red light increased it in both mutants. The observed general and genotype-specific, light-dependent changes in the accumulation and subcellular distribution of glutathione participate in adjusting the redox-dependent metabolism to the actual environmental conditions.
33430426/Tuning the Electrochemical Properties of Novel Asymmetric Integral Sulfonated Polysulfone Cation Exchange Membranes In this study, novel asymmetric integral cation exchange membranes were prepared by the wet phase inversion of sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) solutions. SPSf with different degrees of sulfonation (DS) was synthesized by variation in the amount of chlorosulfonic acid utilized as a sulfonating agent. The characterization of SPSf samples was performed using FTIR and 1H-NMR techniques. SPSf with a DS of 0.31 (0.67 meq/g corresponding ion exchange capacity) was chosen to prepare the membranes, as polymers with a higher DS resulted in poor mechanical properties and excessive swelling in water. By a systematic study, the opportunity to tune the properties of SPSf membranes by acting on the composition of the polymeric solution was demonstrated. The effect of two different phase inversion parameters, solvent type and co-solvent ratio, were investigated by morphological and electrochemical characterization. The best properties (permselectivity of 0.86 and electrical resistance of 6.3 ohm cm2) were obtained for the membrane prepared with 2-propanol (IPA):1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) in a 20:80 ratio. This membrane was further characterized in different solution concentrations to estimate its performance in a Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) operation. Although the estimated generated power was less than that of the commercial CMX (Neosepta) membrane, used as a benchmark, the tailor-made membrane can be considered as a cost-effective alternative, as one of the main limitations to the commercialization of RED is the high membrane price.
33435280/Dietary Salt Accelerates Orthodontic Tooth Movement by Increased Osteoclast Activity Dietary salt uptake and inflammation promote sodium accumulation in tissues, thereby modulating cells like macrophages and fibroblasts. Previous studies showed salt effects on periodontal ligament fibroblasts and on bone metabolism by expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells-5 (NFAT-5). Here, we investigated the impact of salt and NFAT-5 on osteoclast activity and orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). After treatment of osteoclasts without (NS) or with additional salt (HS), we analyzed gene expression and the release of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and calcium phosphate resorption. We kept wild-type mice and mice lacking NFAT-5 in myeloid cells either on a low, normal or high salt diet and inserted an elastic band between the first and second molar to induce OTM. We analyzed the expression of genes involved in bone metabolism, periodontal bone loss, OTM and bone density. Osteoclast activity was increased upon HS treatment. HS promoted periodontal bone loss and OTM and was associated with reduced bone density. Deletion of NFAT-5 led to increased osteoclast activity with NS, whereas we detected impaired OTM in mice. Dietary salt uptake seems to accelerate OTM and induce periodontal bone loss due to reduced bone density, which may be attributed to enhanced osteoclast activity. NFAT-5 influences this reaction to HS, as we detected impaired OTM and osteoclast activity upon deletion.
33435419/Forty-One Plant Extracts Screened for Dual Antidiabetic and Antioxidant Functions: Evaluating the Types of Correlation between alpha-Amylase Inhibition and Free Radical Scavenging Dysregulation of glucose homeostasis followed by chronic hyperglycemia is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus (DM), a disease spreading as a worldwide pandemic for which there is no satisfactory dietary treatment or cure. The development of glucose-controlling drugs that can prevent complications of DM, such as hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, which contribute to the impairment of the key physiological processes in the body, is of grave importance. In pursuit of this goal, this study screened 41 plant extracts for their antidiabetic and antioxidant activities by employing assays to test for alpha-amylase inhibition and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) and by measuring glucose uptake in L6-GLUT4myc cells. While extracts of Rhus coriaria, Punica granatum, Olea europaea, Pelargonium spp., Stevia rebaudiana, and Petroselinum crispum demonstrated significant alpha-amylase inhibition, the extracts of Rhus coriaria and Pelargonium spp. also demonstrated increased FRSA, and the extract of Rhus coriaria stimulated glucose uptake. These natural extracts, which are believed to have fewer side effects because they are prepared from edible plants, interfere with the process in the small intestine that breaks down dietary carbohydrates into monosaccharide and disaccharide derivatives, and thereby suppress increases in diet-induced blood glucose; hence, they may have clinical value for type 2 diabetes management. The Pelargonium spp. and Rhus coriaria extracts demonstrated the highest antidiabetic and antioxidant activities. Both plants may offer valuable medical benefits, especially because they can be taken as dietary supplements by patients with diabetes and can serve as sources of new, natural-based antidiabetic drug candidates. The enhancement of cellular glucose uptake stimulated by Rhus coriaria extract could lead to the development of clinical applications that regulate blood glucose levels from within the circulatory system. Isolating bioactive substances from these plant extracts and testing them in diabetic mice will significantly advance the development of natural drugs that have both antidiabetic and free radical-scavenging properties, likely with lesser side effects.
33440852/Detection of Hypoxanthine from Inosine and Unusual Hydrolysis of Immunosuppressive Drug Azathioprine through the Formation of a Diruthenium(III) System Hypoxanthine (hpx) is an important molecule for both biochemistry research and biomedical applications. It is involved in several biological processes associated to energy and purine metabolism and has been proposed as a biomarker for a variety of disease states. Consequently, the discovery and development of systems suitable for the detection of hypoxanthine is pretty appealing in this research field. Thus, we have obtained a stable diruthenium (III) compound in its dehydrated and hydrated forms with formula [{Ru(micro-Cl)(micro-hpx)}2Cl4] (1a) and [{Ru(micro-Cl)(micro-hpx)}2Cl4] 2H2O (1b), respectively. This purine-based diruthenium(III) system was prepared from two very different starting materials, namely, inosine and azathioprine, the latter being an immunosuppressive drug. Remarkably, it was observed that an unusual azathioprine hydrolysis occurs in the presence of ruthenium, thus generating hypoxanthine instead of the expected 6-mercaptopurine antimetabolite, so that the hpx molecule is linked to two ruthenium(III) ions. 1a and 1b were characterized through IR, SEM, powder and single-crystal X-ray Diffraction and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical studies allowed us to detect the hpx molecule when coordinated to ruthenium in the reported compound. The grade of sensitivity, repeatability and stability reached by this diruthenium system make it potentially useful and could provide a first step to develop new sensor devices suitable to detect hypoxanthine.
33440605/Anti-Obesity and Anti-Adipogenic Effects of Chitosan Oligosaccharide (GO2KA1) in SD Rats and in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes Models Excess body weight is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and associated metabolic complications, and weight loss has been shown to improve glycemic control and decrease morbidity and mortality in T2D patients. Weight-loss strategies using dietary interventions produce a significant decrease in diabetes-related metabolic disturbance. We have previously reported that the supplementation of low molecular chitosan oligosaccharide (GO2KA1) significantly inhibited blood glucose levels in both animals and humans. However, the effect of GO2KA1 on obesity still remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of GO2KA1 on lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression using 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro and plasma lipid profiles using a Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were stimulated to differentiate under the adipogenic stimulation in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of GO2KA1. Adipocyte differentiation was confirmed by Oil Red O staining of lipids and the expression of adipogenic gene expression. Compared to control group, the cells treated with GO2KA1 significantly decreased in intracellular lipid accumulation with concomitant decreases in the expression of key transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBP/alpha). Consistently, the mRNA expression of downstream adipogenic target genes such as fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), fatty acid synthase (FAS), were significantly lower in the GO2KA1-treated group than in the control group. In vivo, male SD rats were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks to induced obesity, followed by oral administration of GO2KA1 at 0.1 g/kg/body weight or vehicle control in HFD. We assessed body weight, food intake, plasma lipids, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) for liver function, and serum level of adiponectin, a marker for obesity-mediated metabolic syndrome. Compared to control group GO2KA1 significantly suppressed body weight gain (185.8 +- 8.8 g vs. 211.6 +- 20.1 g, p < 0.05) with no significant difference in food intake. The serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significantly lower in the GO2KA1-treated group than in the control group, whereas the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level was higher in the GO2KA1 group. The GO2KA1-treated group also showed a significant reduction in ALT and AST levels compared to the control. Moreover, serum adiponectin levels were significantly 1.5-folder higher than the control group. These in vivo and in vitro findings suggest that dietary supplementation of GO2KA1 may prevent diet-induced weight gain and the anti-obesity effect is mediated in part by inhibiting adipogenesis and increasing adiponectin level.
33435580/Continuous-Flow Synthesis of Thioureas, Enabled by Aqueous Polysulfide Solution We have developed the continuous-flow synthesis of thioureas in a multicomponent reaction starting from isocyanides, amidines, or amines and sulfur. The aqueous polysulfide solution enabled the application of sulfur under homogeneous and mild conditions. The crystallized products were isolated by simple filtration after the removal of the co-solvent, and the sulfur retained in the mother liquid. Presenting a wide range of thioureas synthesized by this procedure confirms the utility of the convenient continuous-flow application of sulfur.
33445529/Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in Asymmetric Hetero-Ene Type Reactions: Improving Organocatalyst Performance at Lower Temperatures Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been widely used as (co)solvents in several catalytic processes modifying, in most of the cases, the catalyst activity and/or the selectivity for the studied reactions. However, there are just a few examples of their use in hydrogen bonding organocatalysis. In this paper, we show the positive effect of a set of imidazole-based ionic liquids ([bmim]BF4 and [hmim]PF6) in the enantioselective addition of formaldehyde tert-butylhydrazone to prochiral alpha-keto esters catalyzed by a sugar-based chiral thiourea. Reactions performed in the presence of low percentages of RTILs led to an increase of the catalyst activity, thereby making possible to work at lower temperatures. Thus, the chiral tert-butyl azomethyl tertiary alcohols could be obtained with moderate to good conversions and higher enantioselectivities for most of the studied substrates when using up to 30 vol% of [hmim]PF6 as a cosolvent in processes performed in toluene.
33430439/The Usefulness of Trivalent Phosphorus for the Synthesis of Dendrimers Dendrimers are hyperbranched macromolecules, which are synthesized step-by-step by the repetition of a series of reactions. While many different types of dendrimers are known, this review focusses on the use of trivalent phosphorus derivatives (essentially phosphines and phosphoramidites) for the synthesis of dendrimers. The first part presents dendrimers constituted of phosphines at each branching point. The other parts display the use of trivalent phosphorus derivatives during the synthesis of dendrimers. Different types of reactions have been applied to phosphines. The very first examples of phosphorus-containing dendrimers were obtained by the alkylation of phosphines. Then, several families of dendrimers were elaborated by reaction of phosphoramidites. Such a type of reaction is the base of the solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotides; it has been applied in particular for the synthesis of dendrimers constituted of oligonucleotides. Finally, the Staudinger reaction between phosphines and azides afforded different families of dendrimers, and was at the origin of accelerated methods of synthesis of dendrimers. Besides, the reactivity of the P=N-P=S linkages created by this reaction led to very original dendritic structures.
33435402/Chemistry, Chemotaxonomy and Biological Activity of the Latrunculid Sponges (Order Poecilosclerida, Family Latrunculiidae) Marine sponges are exceptionally prolific sources of natural products for the discovery and development of new drugs. Until now, sponges have contributed around 30% of all natural metabolites isolated from the marine environment. Family Latrunculiidae Topsent, 1922 (class Demospongiae Sollas, 1885, order Poecilosclerida Topsent, 1928) is a small sponge family comprising seven genera. Latrunculid sponges are recognized as the major reservoirs of diverse types of pyrroloiminoquinone-type alkaloids, with a myriad of biological activities, in particular, cytotoxicity, fuelling their exploration for anticancer drug discovery. Almost 100 pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids and their structurally related compounds have been reported from the family Latrunculiidae. The systematics of latrunculid sponges has had a complex history, however it is now well understood. The pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids have provided important chemotaxonomic characters for this sponge family. Latrunculid sponges have been reported to contain other types of metabolites, such as peptides (callipeltins), norditerpenes and norsesterpenes (trunculins) and macrolides (latrunculins), however, the sponges containing latrunculins and trunculins have been transferred to other sponge families. This review highlights a comprehensive literature survey spanning from the first chemical investigation of a New Zealand Latrunculia sp. in 1986 until August 2020, focusing on the chemical diversity and biological activities of secondary metabolites reported from the family Latrunculiidae. The biosynthetic (microbial) origin and the taxonomic significance of pyrroloiminoquinone related alkaloids are also discussed. 
33440795/Melatonin in Wine and Beer: Beneficial Effects Melatonin is a hormone secreted in the pineal gland with several functions, especially regulation of circadian sleep cycle and the biological processes related to it. This review evaluates the bioavailability of melatonin and resulting metabolites, the presence of melatonin in wine and beer and factors that influence it, and finally the different benefits related to treatment with melatonin. When administered orally, melatonin is mainly absorbed in the rectum and the ileum; it has a half-life of about 0.45-1 h and is extensively inactivated in the liver by phase 2 enzymes. Melatonin (MEL) concentration varies from picograms to ng/mL in fermented beverages such as wine and beer, depending on the fermentation process. These low quantities, within a dietary intake, are enough to reach significant plasma concentrations of melatonin, and are thus able to exert beneficial effects. Melatonin has demonstrated antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective actions. These benefits are related to its free radical scavenging properties as well and the direct interaction with melatonin receptors, which are involved in complex intracellular signaling pathways, including inhibition of angiogenesis and cell proliferation, among others. In the present review, the current evidence on the effects of melatonin on different pathophysiological conditions is also discussed.
33435555/Investigation of the Physical, Chemical and Microbiological Stability of Losartan Potassium 5 mg/mL Extemporaneous Oral Liquid Suspension Extemporaneous oral liquid preparations are commonly used when there is no commercially available dosage form for adjustable dosing. In most cases, there is a lack of stability data to allow for an accurately assigned shelf life and storage conditions to give greater confidence of product safety and efficacy over its shelf life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical, chemical and microbiological stability of an extemporaneous oral liquid suspension of losartan potassium, 5 mg/mL, used to treat paediatric hypertension in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Ireland. The losartan content of extemporaneous oral suspensions, prepared with and without addition of water, was measured by UV and confirmed by HPLC analysis. Suspensions were stored at 4  C and room temperature (RT) and were monitored for changes in; pH, colour, odour, re-dispersibility, Total Aerobic Microbial Count, Total Yeast and Mould Count and absence of E. coli. Results showed that suspensions prepared by both methods, stored at 4  C and RT, were physically and microbiologically stable over 28 days. Initial losartan content of all suspensions was lower than expected at 80-81% and did not change significantly over the 28 days. HPLC and NMR did not detect degradation of losartan in the samples. Suspensions prepared in water showed 100% losartan content. The reduced initial losartan content was confirmed by HPLC and was related to the acidic pH of the suspension vehicle. Physiochemical properties of the drug are important factors for consideration in the selection of suspension vehicle for extemporaneous compounding of oral suspensions as they can influence the quality, homogeneity and efficacy of these preparations.
33440779/Ellagitannins and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins of Three Polygonaceous Plants The aim of this study was to characterize hydrolyzable tannins in Polygonaceous plants, as only a few plants have previously been reported to contain ellagitannins. From Persicaria chinensis, a new hydrolyzable tannin called persicarianin was isolated and characterized to be 3-O-galloyl-4,6-(S)-dehydrohexahydroxydiphenoyl-d-glucose. Interestingly, acid hydrolysis of this compound afforded ellagic acid, despite the absence of a hexahydroxydiphenoyl group. From the rhizome of Polygonum runcinatum var. sinense, a large amount of granatin A, along with minor ellagitannins, helioscpoinin A, davicratinic acids B and C, and a new ellagitannin called polygonanin A, were isolated. Based on 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic examination, the structure of polygonanin A was determined to be 1,6-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-2,4-hydroxychebuloyl-beta-d-glucopyranose. These are the second and third hydrolyzable tannins isolated from Polygonaceous plants. In addition, oligomeric proanthocyanidins of Persicaria capitatum and P. chinensis were characterized by thiol degradation. These results suggested that some Polygonaceous plants are the source of hydrolyzable tannins not only proanthocyanidins.
33435390/Antioxidant, Cytotoxic, Genotoxic, and DNA-Protective Potential of 2,3-Substituted Quinazolinones: Structure:Activity Relationship Study The evaluation of antioxidant compounds that counteract the mutagenic effects caused by the direct action of reactive oxygen species on DNA molecule is of considerable interest. Therefore, a series of 2,3-substituted quinazolinone derivatives (Q1-Q8) were investigated by different assays, and the relationship between their biological properties and chemical structure was examined. Genotoxicity and the potential DNA-protective effects of Q1-Q8 were evaluated by comet assay and DNA topology assay. Antioxidant activity was examined by DPPH-radical-scavenging, reducing-power, and total antioxidant status (TAS) assays. The cytotoxic effect of compounds was assessed in human renal epithelial cells (TH-1) and renal carcinoma cells (Caki-1) by MTT assay. Analysis of the structure-activity relationship disclosed significant differences in the activity depending on the substitution pattern. Derivatives Q5-Q8, bearing electron-donating moieties, were the most potent members of this series. Compounds were not genotoxic and considerably decreased the levels of DNA lesions induced by oxidants (H2O2, Fe2+ ions). Furthermore, compounds exhibited higher cytotoxicity in Caki-1 compared to that in TH-1 cells. Substantial antioxidant effect and DNA-protectivity along with the absence of genotoxicity suggested that the studied quinazolinones might represent potential model structures for the development of pharmacologically active agents.
33435543/Syntheses and Characterization of Novel Perovskite-Type LaScO3-Based Lithium Ionic Conductors Perovskite-type lithium ionic conductors were explored in the (LixLa1-x/3)ScO3 system following their syntheses via a high-pressure solid-state reaction. Phase identification indicated that a solid solution with a perovskite-type structure was formed in the range 0 <= x < 0.6. When x = 0.45, (Li0.45La0.85)ScO3 exhibited the highest ionic conductivity and a low activation energy. Increasing the loading of lithium as an ionic diffusion carrier expanded the unit cell volume and contributed to the higher ionic conductivity and lower activation energy. Cations with higher oxidation numbers were introduced into the A/B sites to improve the ionic conductivity. Ce4+ and Zr4+ or Nb5+ dopants partially substituted the A-site (La/Li) and B-site Sc, respectively. Although B-site doping produced a lower ionic conductivity, A-site Ce4+ doping improved the conductive properties. A perovskite-type single phase was obtained for (Li0.45La0.78Ce0.05)ScO3 upon Ce4+ doping, providing a higher ionic conductivity than (Li0.45La0.85)ScO3. Compositional analysis and crystal-structure refinement of (Li0.45La0.85)ScO3 and (Li0.45La0.78Ce0.05)ScO3 revealed increased lithium contents and expansion of the unit cell upon Ce4+ co-doping. The highest ionic conductivity of 1.1 x 10-3 S cm-1 at 623 K was confirmed for (Li0.4Ce0.15La0.67)ScO3, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the (LixLa1-x/3)ScO3 system.
33445748/Melanogenesis Promoting Effect, Antioxidant Activity, and UPLC-ESI-HRMS Characterization of Phenolic Compounds of Argan Leaves Extract The use of natural products for the regulation of skin pigmentation is gaining popularity. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of argan leaves extract (ALE) on melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells, determined its antioxidant activity, then quantified and identified its phenolic components. B16 cells were treated with various concentrations of ALE, then the cell viability and proliferation were assessed using MTT assay while the melanin content was determined using spectrophotometric methods. The expression level of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase related protein-1 (TRP-1) and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) was evaluated by Western blotting. The antioxidant activity of ALE was investigated using four different assays while UPLC-ESI-HRMS analysis was used to characterize the ALE phenolic profile. Fourteen phenolic compounds were identified, of which six are reported for the first time to be present in ALE. ALE treatment increases the melanin content of B16 cells in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. This was revealed by the observed ALE-increased expression level of TYR, DCT, and TRP-1. These bioactivities may be mainly attributed to its high flavonoids content. Argan leaves have the potential for use as a treatment for hypopigmentation disorders and as a bioactive component of cosmetic products that aim to increase pigmentation.
33445736/Fluorescent Probes for Selective Recognition of Hypobromous Acid: Achievements and Future Perspectives Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in numerous pathological processes and their homeostasis facilitates the dynamic balance of intracellular redox states. Among ROS, hypobromous acid (HOBr) has a high similarity to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in both chemical and physical properties, whereas it has received relatively little attention. Meanwhile, selective recognition of endogenous HOBr suffers great challenges due to the fact that the concentration of this molecule is much lower than that of HOCl. Fluorescence-based detection systems have emerged as very important tools to monitor biomolecules in living cells and organisms owing to distinct advantages, particularly the temporal and spatial sampling for in vivo imaging applications. To date, the development of HOBr-specific fluorescent probes is still proceeding quite slowly, and the research related to this area has not been systematically summarized. In this review, we are the first to review the progress made so far in fluorescent probes for selective recognition and detection of HOBr. The molecular structures, sensing mechanisms, and their successful applications of these probes as bioimaging agents are discussed here in detail. Importantly, we hope this review will call for more attention to this rising field, and that this could stimulate new future achievements.
33445725/Ocular Delivery of Polyphenols: Meeting the Unmet Needs Nature has become one of the main sources of exploration for researchers that search for new potential molecules to be used in therapy. Polyphenols are emerging as a class of compounds that have attracted the attention of pharmaceutical and biomedical scientists. Thanks to their structural peculiarities, polyphenolic compounds are characterized as good scavengers of free radical species. This, among other medicinal effects, permits them to interfere with different molecular pathways that are involved in the inflammatory process. Unfortunately, many compounds of this class possess low solubility in aqueous solvents and low stability. Ocular pathologies are spread worldwide. It is estimated that every individual at least once in their lifetime experiences some kind of eye disorder. Oxidative stress or inflammatory processes are the basic etiological mechanisms of many ocular pathologies. A variety of polyphenolic compounds have been proved to be efficient in suppressing some of the indicators of these pathologies in in vitro and in vivo models. Further application of polyphenolic compounds in ocular therapy lacks an adequate formulation approach. Therefore, more emphasis should be put in advanced delivery strategies that will overcome the limits of the delivery site as well as the ones related to the polyphenols in use. This review analyzes different drug delivery strategies that are employed for the formulation of polyphenolic compounds when used to treat ocular pathologies related to oxidative stress and inflammation.
33445716/An Efficient Synthesis of Optically Active [4-13C] Labelled Quorum Sensing Signal Autoinducer-2 A new synthetic route for the quorum sensing signal Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is described and used for the preparation of [4-13C]-AI-2 starting from [1-13C]-bromoacetic acid. The key step in this process was the enantioselective reduction of an intermediate ketone. This synthesis provides, selectively, both enantiomers of the labelled or unlabelled parent compound, (R) or (S)-4,5-dihydroxypentane-2,3-dione (DPD) and was used for an improved synthesis of [1-13C]-AI-2.
33445710/11-Keto-alpha-Boswellic Acid, a Novel Triterpenoid from Boswellia spp. with Chemotaxonomic Potential and Antitumor Activity against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Boswellic acids, and particularly 11-keto-boswellic acids, triterpenoids derived from the genus Boswellia (Burseraceae), are known for their anti-inflammatory and potential antitumor efficacy. Although boswellic acids generally occur as alpha-isomers (oleanane type) and beta-isomers (ursane type), 11-keto-boswellic acid (KBA) was found only as the beta-isomer, beta-KBA. Here, the existence and natural occurrence of the respective alpha-isomer, 11-keto-alpha-boswellic acid (alpha-KBA), is demonstrated for the first time. Initially, alpha-KBA was synthesized and characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and a highly selective, sensitive, and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed by Design of Experiments (DoE) using a pentafluorophenyl stationary phase. This method allowed the selective quantification of individual 11-keto-boswellic acids and provided evidence for alpha-KBA in Boswellia spp. oleogum resins. The contents of alpha-KBA as well as further boswellic acids and the composition of essential oils were used to chemotaxonomically classify 41 Boswellia oleogum resins from 9 different species. Moreover, alpha-KBA exhibited cytotoxicity against three treatment-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and also induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo. The respective beta-isomer and the acetylated form demonstrate higher cytotoxic efficacies against TNBC cells. This provides further insights into the structure-activity relationship of boswellic acids and could support future developments of potential anti-inflammatory and antitumor drugs.
33445772/Pectin-Lyase-Modified Ginseng Extract and Ginsenoside Rd Inhibits High Glucose-Induced ROS Production in Mesangial Cells and Prevents Renal Dysfunction in db/db Mice Diabetes increases the incidence rate of chronic renal disease. Pectin-lyase-modified ginseng (GS-E3D), with enhanced ginsenoside Rd content, has been newly developed. In this study, renal protective roles of GS-E3D in type-2 diabetic db/db mice were investigated. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by high glucose (25 mM) was reduced by ES-E3D (75%) and ginsenoside Rd (60%). Diabetic db/db mice received 100 or 250 mg/kg/day of GS-E3D daily via oral gavage for 6 weeks. Albuminuria and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OhdG, an oxidative stress marker) levels were increased in db/db mice and the levels recovered after GS-E3D treatment. In renal tissues, TUNEL-positive cells were decreased after GS-E3D treatment, and the increased apoptosis-related protein expressions were restored after GS-E3D treatment. Therefore, GS-E3D has a potent protective role in diabetes-induced renal dysfunction through antioxidative and antiapoptotic activities. These results may help patients to select a dietary supplement for diabetes when experiencing renal dysfunction.
33450823/Common Pitfalls in the Management of Patients with Micronutrient Deficiency: Keep in Mind the Stomach Micronutrient deficiencies are relatively common, in particular iron and cobalamin deficiency, and may potentially lead to life-threatening clinical consequences when not promptly recognized and treated, especially in elderly patients. The stomach plays an important role in the homeostasis of some important hematopoietic micronutrients like iron and cobalamin, and probably in others equally important such as ascorbic acid, calcium, and magnesium. A key role is played by the corpus oxyntic mucosa composed of parietal cells whose main function is gastric acid secretion and intrinsic factor production. Gastric acid secretion is necessary for the digestion and absorption of cobalamin and the absorption of iron, calcium, and probably magnesium, and is also essential for the absorption, secretion, and activation of ascorbic acid. Several pathological conditions such as Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis, corpus atrophic gastritis, as well as antisecretory drugs, and gastric surgery may interfere with the normal functioning of gastric oxyntic mucosa and micronutrients homeostasis. Investigation of the stomach by gastroscopy plus biopsies should always be considered in the management of patients with micronutrient deficiencies. The current review focuses on the physiological and pathophysiological aspects of gastric acid secretion and the role of the stomach in iron, cobalamin, calcium, and magnesium deficiency and ascorbate homeostasis.
33445813/Ellagitannin-Lipid Interaction by HR-MAS NMR Spectroscopy Ellagitannins have antimicrobial activity, which might be related to their interactions with membrane lipids. We studied the interactions of 12 different ellagitannins and pentagalloylglucose with a lipid extract of Escherichia coli by high-resolution magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. The nuclear Overhauser effect was utilized to measure the cross relaxation rates between ellagitannin and lipid protons. The shifting of lipid signals in 1H NMR spectra of ellagitannin-lipid mixture due to ring current effect was also observed. The ellagitannins that showed interaction with lipids had clear structural similarities. All ellagitannins that had interactions with lipids had glucopyranose cores. In addition to the central polyol, the most important structural feature affecting the interaction seemed to be the structural flexibility of the ellagitannin. Even dimeric and trimeric ellagitannins could penetrate to the lipid bilayers if their structures were flexible with free galloyl and hexahydroxydiphenoyl groups.
33445792/Inhibitory Effect of Thai Purple Rice Husk Extract on Chemically Induced Carcinogenesis in Rats This study investigated the cancer chemopreventive effects of an acidic methanol extract of purple rice husk on chemically induced carcinogenesis in rats. This purple rice husk extract (PRHE) had high polyphenol contents. Vanillic acid was a major phenolic compound in PRHE. Three major anthocyanins found in PRHE were malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. PRHE was not toxic and clastogenic in rats. The LD50 of PRHE was greater than 2000 mg kg-1 body weight (BW). The oral administration of 300 or 1000 mg kg-1 BW of PRHE for 28 days significantly decreased the number of micronucleated hepatocytes in diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats. The inhibitory mechanisms were associated with the reduction of cytochrome P450 2E1 expression and induction of some detoxifying enzymes in the liver. In addition, treatment with 500 mg kg-1 BW of PRHE for eight weeks did not induce preneoplastic lesions in the liver and colon. It significantly inhibited hepatic glutathione-S-transferase positive foci formation induced by diethylnitrosamine and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine by suppression of hepatocyte proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, PRHE did not present toxicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity in rats. It exhibited cancer chemopreventive properties against chemically induced early stages rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Anthocyanins and vanillic acid might be candidate anticarcinogenic compounds in purple rice husk.
33445777/Novel Fluorinated 7-Hydroxycoumarin Derivatives Containing an Oxime Ether Moiety: Design, Synthesis, Crystal Structure and Biological Evaluation A series of fluorinated 7-hydroxycoumarin derivatives containing an oxime ether moiety have been designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antifungal activity. All the target compounds were determined by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FTIR and HR-MS spectra. The single-crystal structures of compounds 4e, 4h, 5h and 6c were further confirmed using X-ray diffraction. The antifungal activities against Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea), Alternaria solani (A. solani), Gibberella zeae (G. zeae), Rhizoctorzia solani (R. solani), Colletotrichum orbiculare (C. orbiculare) and Alternaria alternata (A. alternata) were evaluated in vitro. The preliminary bioassays showed that some of the designed compounds displayed the promising antifungal activities against the above tested fungi. Strikingly, the target compounds 5f and 6h exhibited outstanding antifungal activity against B. cinerea at 100 mug/mL, with the corresponding inhibition rates reached 90.1 and 85.0%, which were better than the positive control Osthole (83.6%) and Azoxystrobin (46.5%). The compound 5f was identified as the promising fungicide candidate against B. cinerea with the EC50 values of 5.75 mug/mL, which was obviously better than Osthole (33.20 mug/mL) and Azoxystrobin (64.95 mug/mL). Meanwhile, the compound 5f showed remarkable antifungal activities against R. solani with the EC50 values of 28.96 mug/mL, which was better than Osthole (67.18 mug/mL) and equivalent to Azoxystrobin (21.34 mug/mL). The results provide a significant foundation for the search of novel fluorinated 7-hydroxycoumarin derivatives with good antifungal activity.
33450885/Effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probiotic in Early Pregnancy on Plasma Conjugated Bile Acids in a Randomised Controlled Trial We have previously shown that probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) led to a reduced incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Here we investigate whether HN001 supplementation resulted in alterations in fasting lipids, insulin resistance, or bile acids (BAs) during pregnancy. Fasting plasma samples collected at 24-30 weeks' gestation, from 348 women randomised at 14-16 weeks' gestation to consume daily probiotic HN001 (n = 172) or a placebo (n = 176) were analysed for lipids, insulin, glucose and BAs. Women supplemented with HN001 had lower fasting glucose compared with placebo (p = 0.040), and lower GDM. Significant differences were found in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein (HDL)-c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and BAs by GDM status. Lower fasting conjugated BAs were seen in women receiving HN001. A significant decrease of glycocholic acid (GCA) was found in older (age >= 35) women who received HN001 (p = 0.005), while GDM women showed significant reduced taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) (p = 0.018). Fasting conjugated BA was positively correlated with fasting glucose (r = 0.136, p = 0.020) and fasting insulin (r = 0.113, p = 0.036). Probiotic HN001 supplementation decreases conjugated BAs and might play a role in the improvement of glucose metabolism in women with pregnancy.
33450880/WO3 Nanowire/Carbon Nanotube Interlayer as a Chemical Adsorption Mediator for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries We developed a new nanowire for enhancing the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this study, we synthesized WO3 nanowires (WNWs) via a simple hydrothermal method. WNWs and one-dimensional materials are easily mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form interlayers. The WNW interacts with lithium polysulfides through a thiosulfate mediator, retaining the lithium polysulfide near the cathode to increase the reaction kinetics. The lithium-sulfur cell achieves a very high initial discharge capacity of 1558 and 656 mAh g-1 at 0.1 and 3 C, respectively. Moreover, a cell with a high sulfur mass loading of 4.2 mg cm-2 still delivers a high capacity of 1136 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.2 C and it showed a capacity of 939 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles. The WNW/CNT interlayer maintains structural stability even after electrochemical testing. This excellent performance and structural stability are due to the chemical adsorption and catalytic effects of the thiosulfate mediator on WNW.
33450987/Solubility Determination of c-Met Inhibitor in Solvent Mixtures and Mathematical Modeling to Develop Nanosuspension Formulation The solubility and dissolution thermodynamics of new c-Met inhibitor, ABN401, were determined in eleven solvents and Transcutol  HP-water mixture (TWM) from 298.15 to 318.15 K. The experimental solubilities were validated using five mathematical models, namely modified Apelblat, van't Hoff, Buchowski-Ksiazaczak lambdah, Yalkowsky, and Jouyban-Acree van't Hoff models. The experimental results were correlated and utilized further to investigate the feasibility of nanosuspension formation using liquid anti-solvent precipitation. Thermodynamic solubility of ABN401 increased significantly with the increase in temperature and maximum solubility was obtained with Transcutol  HP while low solubility in was obtained water. An activity coefficient study indicated that high molecular interaction was observed in ABN401-Transcutol  HP (THP). The solubility increased proportionately as the mole fraction of Transcutol  HP increased in TWM, which was also supported by a solvent effect study. The result suggested endothermic and entropy-driven dissolution. Based on the solubility, nanosuspension was designed with Transcutol  HP as solvent, and water as anti-solvent. The mean particle size of nanosuspension decreased to 43.05 nm when the mole fraction of ABN401 in THP, and mole fraction of ABN401 in TWM mixture were decreased to 0.04 and 0.1. The ultrasonicated nanosuspension appeared to give comparatively higher dissolution than micronized nanosuspension and provide a candidate formulation for in vivo purposes.
33450940/Discovery of Cysteine and Its Derivatives as Novel Antiviral and Antifungal Agents Based on the structure of the natural product cysteine, a series of thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acids were designed and synthesized. All target compounds bearing thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and HRMS techniques. The antiviral and antifungal activities of cysteine and its derivatives were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The results of anti-TMV activity revealed that all compounds exhibited moderate to excellent activities against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) at the concentration of 500 mug/mL. The compounds cysteine (1), 3-4, 7, 10, 13, 20, 23, and 24 displayed higher anti-TMV activities than the commercial plant virucide ribavirin (inhibitory rate: 40, 40, and 38% at 500 mug/mL for inactivation, curative, and protection activity in vivo, respectively), especially compound 3 (inhibitory rate: 51%, 47%, and 49% at 500 mug/mL for inactivation, curative, and protection activity in vivo, respectively) with excellent antiviral activity emerged as a new antiviral candidate. Antiviral mechanism research by TEM exhibited that compound 3 could inhibit virus assembly by aggregated the 20S protein disk. Molecular docking results revealed that compound 3 with higher antiviral activities than that of compound 24 did show stronger interaction with TMV CP. Further fungicidal activity tests against 14 kinds of phytopathogenic fungi revealed that these cysteine derivatives displayed broad-spectrum fungicidal activities. Compound 16 exhibited higher antifungal activities against Cercospora arachidicola Hori and Alternaria solani than commercial fungicides carbendazim and chlorothalonil, which emerged as a new candidate for fungicidal research.
33451079/Controversy of Peptide Cyclization from Tripeptide The present investigation reports an attempt to synthesize naturally occurring alpha-cyclic tripeptide cyclo(Gly-l-Pro-l-Glu) 1, [cyclo(GPE)], previously isolated from the Ruegeria strain of bacteria with marine sponge Suberites domuncula. Three linear precursors, Boc-GPE(OBn)2, Boc-PE(OBn)G and Boc-E(OBn)GP, were synthesized using a solution phase peptide coupling protocol. Although cyclo(GPE) 1 was our original target, all precursors were dimerized and cyclized at 0  C with high dilution to form corresponding alpha-cyclic hexapeptide, cyclo(GPE(OBn))2 7, which was then converted to cyclic hexapeptide cyclo(GPE)2 2. Cyclization at higher temperature induced racemization and gave cyclic tripeptide cyclo(GPDE(OBn)) 9. Structure characteristics of the newly synthesized cyclopeptides were determined using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The chemical shift values of carbonyls of 2 and 7 are larger than 170 ppm, indicating the formation of a cyclic hexapeptide.
33451050/Synthesis, Stability, and Antidiabetic Activity Evaluation of (-)-Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) Palmitate Derived from Natural Tea Polyphenols This work describes a novel approach for the synthesis of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) palmitate by a chemical-synthesis method, where the elevated stability of the EGCG derivative is achieved. Various parameters affecting the acylation process, such as the base, solvent, as well as the molar ratio of palmitoyl chloride, have been studied to optimize the acylation procedure. The optimized reaction condition was set as follows: EGCG/palmitoyl chloride/sodium acetate was under a molar ratio of 1:2:2, with acetone as the solvent, and the reaction temperature was 40  C. Under the optimized condition, the yield reached 90.6%. The EGCG palmitate (PEGCG) was isolated and identified as 4'-O-palmitoyl EGCG. Moreover, the stability of PEGCG under different conditions was proved significantly superior to EGCG. Finally, PEGCG showed better inhibition towards alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, which was 4.5 and 52 times of EGCG, respectively. Molecular docking simulations confirmed the in vitro assay results. This study set a novel and practical synthetic approach for the derivatization of EGCG, and suggest that PEGCG may act as an antidiabetic agent.
33451084/Toxicity of Zn-Fe Layered Double Hydroxide to Different Organisms in the Aquatic Environment The application of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomaterials as catalysts has attracted great interest due to their unique structural features. It also triggered the need to study their fate and behavior in the aquatic environment. In the present study, Zn-Fe nanolayered double hydroxides (Zn-Fe LDHs) were synthesized using a co-precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analyses. The toxicity of the home-made Zn-Fe LDHs catalyst was examined by employing a variety of aquatic organisms from different trophic levels, namely the marine photobacterium Vibrio fischeri, the freshwater microalga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, and the duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza. From the experimental results, it was evident that the acute toxicity of the catalyst depended on the exposure time and type of selected test organism. Zn-Fe LDHs toxicity was also affected by its physical state in suspension, chemical composition, as well as interaction with the bioassay test medium.
33451117/Glycan-to-Glycan Binding: Molecular Recognition through Polyvalent Interactions Mediates Specific Cell Adhesion Glycan-to-glycan binding was shown by biochemical and biophysical measurements to mediate xenogeneic self-recognition and adhesion in sponges, stage-specific cell compaction in mice embryos, and in vitro tumor cell adhesion in mammals. This intermolecular recognition process is accepted as the new paradigm accompanying high-affinity and low valent protein-to-protein and protein-to-glycan binding in cellular interactions. Glycan structures in sponges have novel species-specific sequences. Their common features are the large size >100 kD, polyvalency >100 repeats of the specific self-binding oligosaccharide, the presence of fucose, and sulfated and/or pyruvylated hexoses. These structural and functional properties, different from glycosaminoglycans, inspired their classification under the glyconectin name. The molecular mechanism underlying homophilic glyconectin-to-glyconectin binding relies on highly polyvalent, strong, and structure-specific interactions of small oligosaccharide motifs, possessing ultra-weak self-binding strength and affinity. Glyconectin localization at the glycocalyx outermost cell surface layer suggests their role in the initial recognition and adhesion event during the complex and multistep process. In mammals, Lex-to-Lex homophilic binding is structure-specific and has ultra-weak affinity. Cell adhesion is achieved through highly polyvalent interactions, enabled by clustering of small low valent structure in plasma membranes.
33451130/The Habitual Diet of Dutch Adult Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis Has Pro-Inflammatory Properties and Low Diet Quality Scores We determined the nutritional adequacy and overall quality of the diets of adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Dietary intakes stratified by sex and age were compared to Dietary Reference Values (DRV). Overall diet quality was assessed by two independent Diet-Quality-Indices scores, the PANDiet and DHD-index, and compared to age- and gender-matched subjects from the general population. Lastly, food and nutrient intakes of EoE patients were compared to intakes of the general population. Saturated fat intake was significantly higher and dietary fiber intake significantly lower than the DRV in both males and females. In males, the DRV were not reached for potassium, magnesium, selenium, and vitamins A and D. In females, the DRV were not reached for iron, sodium, potassium, selenium, and vitamins A, B2, C and D. EoE patients had a significantly lower PANDiet and DHD-index compared to the general population, although the relative intake (per 1000 kcal) of vegetables/fruits/olives was significantly higher (yet still up to 65% below the recommended daily amounts) and alcohol intake was significantly lower compared to the general Dutch population. In conclusion, the composition of the habitual diet of adult EoE patients has several pro-inflammatory and thus unfavorable immunomodulatory properties, just as the general Dutch population, and EoE patients had lower overall diet quality scores than the general population. Due to the observational character of this study, further research is needed to explore whether this contributes to the development and progression of EoE.
33451119/Structural Changes in Milled Wood Lignin (MWL) of Chinese Quince (Chaenomeles sinensis) Fruit Subjected to Subcritical Water Treatment Subcritical water treatment has received considerable attention due to its cost effectiveness and environmentally friendly properties. In this investigation, Chinese quince fruits were submitted to subcritical water treatment (130, 150, and 170  C), and the influence of treatments on the structure of milled wood lignin (MWL) was evaluated. Structural properties of these lignin samples (UL, L130, L150, and L170) were investigated by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC), FT-IR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), TGA, pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), 2D-Heteronculear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) -NMR, and 31P-NMR. The carbohydrate analysis showed that xylose in the samples increased significantly with higher temperature, and according to molecular weight and thermal analysis, the MWLs of the pretreated residues have higher thermal stability with increased molecular weight. The spectra of 2D-NMR and 31P-NMR demonstrated that the chemical linkages in the MWLs were mainly beta-O-4' ether bonds, beta-5' and beta-beta', and the units were principally G- S- H- type with small amounts of ferulic acids; these results are consistent with the results of Py-GC/MS analysis. It is believed that understanding the structural changes in MWL caused by subcritical water treatment will contribute to understanding the mechanism of subcritical water extraction, which in turn will provide a theoretical basis for developing the technology of subcritical water extraction.
33451154/Synthesis of 6,7-Dihydro-1H,5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazoles by Azomethine Imine-Alkyne Cycloadditions Using Immobilized Cu(II)-Catalysts A series of 12 silica gel-bound enaminones and their Cu(II) complexes were prepared and tested for their suitability as heterogeneous catalysts in azomethine imine-alkyne cycloadditions (CuAIAC). Immobilized Cu(II)-enaminone complexes showed promising catalytic activity in the CuAIAC reaction, but these new catalysts suffered from poor reusability. This was not due to the decoordination of copper ions, as the use of enaminone ligands with additional complexation sites resulted in negligible improvement. On the other hand, reusability was improved by the use of 4-aminobenzoic acid linker, attached to 3-aminopropyl silica gel via an amide bond to the enaminone over the more hydrolytically stable N-arylenamine C-N bond. The study showed that silica gel-bound Cu(II)-enaminone complexes are readily available and suitable heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of 6,7-dihydro-1H,5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazoles.
33451160/Identification of Phytochemical-Based beta-Catenin Nuclear Localization Inhibitor in NSCLC: Differential Targeting Population from Member of Isothiocyanates Decades of research has convinced us that phytochemical compounds contained within the plant products are the real deal, and they provide benefits such as health maintenance an d cure to illnesses. One of the deadliest noncommunicable diseases today is lung cancer, hence its disease management still deserves attention. Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation conferring cancer stem cell (CSC) activities to non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) may explain why the disease is still difficult to cure. In the present study, we assessed several representatives of phytochemical categories consisting of alkaloids, chalcones and isothiocyanates for their inhibitory activity to nuclear localization of beta-catenin:an important event for Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation, in lung cancer cell lines. Real-time cell analyzer confirmed that evodiamine (EVO), chelidonine (CHE), isoliquiritigenin (ISO), licochalcone-A (LICO), benzyl isothiocyanate (BI) and phenethylisothiocyanate (PI) exhibited anti-proliferative activities and cytotoxicities to adenocarcinoma cell line SK-LU-1 and human lung CSC primary cell line (HLCSC). Immunofluorescence assay identified that CHE, ISO, LICO, BI and PI were capable of reducing the number of cells harboring beta-catenin within the nuclei of these cells. We extended the characterizations of BI and PI in Wnt-dependent squamous cell carcinoma cell line NCI-H1703 on several CSC functions and found that BI was better at inhibiting soft agar colony formation as an output of self-renewal ability, whereas PI was more effective in inhibiting the growth of multicellular tumor spheroid model mimicking micrometastases. Both however were not able to inhibit migration and invasion of NCI-H1703. In conclusion, BI could potentially be used as a safer alternative to target undifferentiated CSCs as adjuvant therapy, whereas PI could be used as chemotherapy to remove bulk tumor.
33466578/Inflammatory Markers and Hepcidin are Elevated but Serum Iron is Lower in Obese Women of Reproductive Age Limited evidence suggests that serum iron and hepcidin concentrations are dysregulated in obesity and inflammation. The objective of the present study was to compare C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, circulating levels of hepcidin, serum lipids, and iron status in obese vs. normal-weight women of childbearing age. Healthy women aged 18-30 years were recruited for the study (n = 47: 25 obese and 22 normal weight). Fasting blood samples were obtained to measure serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol), complete blood count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, hepcidin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6. Obese women had significantly higher mean serum C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (p < 0.001), hepcidin (p = 0.024), triglycerides (p < 0.001) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (p < 0.001) but lower HDL (p = 0.001) and serum iron/hepcidin ratio (p = 0.011) compared with normal-weight women. BMI correlated positively with inflammatory markers, triglycerides, LDL and total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and negatively with HDL and serum iron/hepcidin ratio. Serum iron correlated negatively with ferritin in the obese group (p = 0.030) but positively in normal weight women (p = 0.002). BMI and ferritin were the only predictors of serum iron/hepcidin ratio accounting for 23% of the variation among subjects. Studies are needed to examine anti-inflammatory dietary approaches that can improve iron biomarkers in obese women.
33466640/The Neosartorya fischeri Antifungal Protein 2 (NFAP2): A New Potential Weapon against Multidrug-Resistant Candida auris Biofilms Candida auris is a potential multidrug-resistant pathogen able to persist on indwelling devices as a biofilm, which serve as a source of catheter-associated infections. Neosartorya fischeri antifungal protein 2 (NFAP2) is a cysteine-rich, cationic protein with potent anti-Candida activity. We studied the in vitro activity of NFAP2 alone and in combination with fluconazole, amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin against C. auris biofilms. The nature of interactions was assessed utilizing the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), a Bliss independence model, and LIVE/DEAD viability assay. NFAP2 exerted synergy with all tested antifungals with FICIs ranging between 0.312-0.5, 0.155-0.5, 0.037-0.375, 0.064-0.375, and 0.064-0.375 for fluconazole, amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, respectively. These results were confirmed using a Bliss model, where NFAP2 produced 17.54 muM2%, 2.16 muM2%, 33.31 muM2%, 10.72 muM2%, and 111.19 muM2% cumulative synergy log volume in combination with fluconazole, amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, respectively. In addition, biofilms exposed to echinocandins (32 mg/L) showed significant cell death in the presence of NFAP2 (128 mg/L). Our study shows that NFAP2 displays strong potential as a novel antifungal compound in alternative therapies to combat C. auris biofilms.
33466636/Effects of 6,8-Diprenylgenistein on VEGF-A-Induced Lymphangiogenesis and Lymph Node Metastasis in an Oral Cancer Sentinel Lymph Node Animal Model Background: The major determining factor of prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is cervical lymph node metastasis. 6,8-Diprenylgenistein (6,8-DG), an isoflavonoid isolated from Cudrania tricuspidata has been reported to have anti-microbial and anti-obesity activities. However, its effects on lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in oral cancer have not yet been reported. Methods: To investigate the in vitro inhibitory effects of 6,8-DG on VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis, we performed the proliferation, tube formation, and migration assay using human lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HLMECs). RT-PCR, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to investigate the expression levels of proteins, and mechanism of 6,8-DG. The in vivo inhibitory effects of 6,8-DG were investigated using an oral cancer sentinel lymph node (OCSLN) animal model. Results: 6,8-DG inhibited the proliferation, migration and tube formation of rhVEGF-A treated HLMECs. In addition, the in vivo lymphatic vessel formation stimulated by rhVEGF-A was significantly reduced by 6,8-DG. 6,8-DG inhibited the expression of VEGF-A rather than other lymphangiogenic factors in CoCl2-treated SCCVII cells. 6,8-DG inhibited the expression and activation of VEGFR-2 stimulated by rhVEGF-A in HLMECs. Also, 6,8-DG inhibited the activation of the lymphangiogenesis-related downstream signaling factors such as FAK, PI3K, AKT, p38, and ERK in rhVEGF-A-treated HLMECs. Additionally, 6,8-DG inhibited the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha), which is involved in the expression of VEGF-A in CoCl2-treated SCCVII cells, and 6,8-DG inhibited VEGF-A signaling via interruption of the binding of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 in HLMECs. In the VEGF-A-induced OCSLN animal model, we confirmed that 6,8-DG suppressed tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis and SLN metastasis. Conclusion: These data suggest that 6,8-DG inhibits VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of 6,8-DG are probably mediated by inhibition of VEGF-A expression in cancer cells and suppression of the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway in HLMEC. Thus, 6,8-DG could be novel and valuable therapeutic agents for metastasis prevention and treatment of oral cancer.
33466613/Effect of Polyhexamethylene Biguanide in Combination with Undecylenamidopropyl Betaine or PslG on Biofilm Clearance Hospital-acquired infection is a great challenge for clinical treatment due to pathogens' biofilm formation and their antibiotic resistance. Here, we investigate the effect of antiseptic agent polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and undecylenamidopropyl betaine (UB) against biofilms of four pathogens that are often found in hospitals, including Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans. We show that 0.02% PHMB, which is 10-fold lower than the concentration of commercial products, has a strong inhibitory effect on the growth, initial attachment, and biofilm formation of all tested pathogens. PHMB can also disrupt the preformed biofilms of these pathogens. In contrast, 0.1% UB exhibits a mild inhibitory effect on biofilm formation of the four pathogens. This concentration inhibits the growth of S. aureus and C. albicans yet has no growth effect on P. aeruginosa or E. coli. UB only slightly enhances the anti-biofilm efficacy of PHMB on P. aeruginosa biofilms. However, pretreatment with PslG, a glycosyl hydrolase that can efficiently inhibit and disrupt P. aeruginosa biofilm, highly enhances the clearance effect of PHMB on P. aeruginosa biofilms. Meanwhile, PslG can also disassemble the preformed biofilms of the other three pathogens within 30 min to a similar extent as UB treatment for 24 h.
33466682/Titanium Dioxide Presents a Different Profile in Dextran Sodium Sulphate-Induced Experimental Colitis in Mice Lacking the IBD Risk Gene Ptpn2 in Myeloid Cells Environmental and genetic factors have been demonstrated to contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies suggested that the food additive; titanium dioxide (TiO2) might play a causative role in the disease. Therefore, in the present study we aimed to explore the interaction between the food additive TiO2 and the well-characterized IBD risk gene protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (Ptpn2) and their role in the development of intestinal inflammation. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced acute colitis was performed in mice lacking the expression of Ptpn2 in myeloid cells (Ptpn2LysMCre) or their wild type littermates (Ptpn2fl/fl) and exposed to the microparticle TiO2. The impact of Ptpn2 on TiO2 signalling pathways and TiO2-induced IL-1beta and IL-10 levels were studied using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Ptpn2LysMCre exposed to TiO2 exhibited more severe intestinal inflammation than their wild type counterparts. This effect was likely due to the impact of TiO2 on the differentiation of intestinal macrophages, suppressing the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages in Ptpn2 deficient mice. Moreover, we also found that TiO2 was able to induce the secretion of IL-1beta via mitogen-activated proteins kinases (MAPKs) and to repress the expression of IL-10 in bone marrow-derived macrophages via MAPK-independent pathways. This is the first evidence of the cooperation between the genetic risk factor Ptpn2 and the environmental factor TiO2 in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. The results presented here suggest that the ingestion of certain industrial compounds should be taken into account, especially in individuals with increased genetic risk
33466670/Impressic Acid Attenuates the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammatory Response by Activating the AMPK/GSK3beta/Nrf2 Axis in RAW264.7 Macrophages Inflammatory diseases are caused by excessive inflammation from pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines produced by macrophages. The Nrf2 signaling pathway protects against inflammatory diseases by inhibiting excessive inflammation via the regulation of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 and NQO1. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of impressic acid (IPA) isolated from Acanthopanax koreanum on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and the underlying molecular mechanisms in RAW264.7 cells. IPA attenuated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. IPA also increased the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 by phosphorylating CaMKKbeta, AMPK, and GSK3beta. Furthermore, ML385, an Nrf2 inhibitor, reversed the inhibitory effect of IPA on LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 cells. Therefore, IPA exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via the AMPK/GSK3beta/Nrf2 signaling pathway in macrophages. Taken together, the findings suggest that IPA has preventive potential for inflammation-related diseases.
33491099/Biological evaluation of the modified nano-amorphous phosphate calcium doped with citrate/poly-amino acid composite as a potential candidate for bone repair and reconstruction Large numbers of research works related to fabricating organic-inorganic composite materials have been carried out to mimic the natural structure of bone. In this study, a new modified n-ACP doped with citrate (n-ACP-cit)/poly (amino acids) (PAA) composite (n-ACP-cit/PAA) was synthesized by employing high bioactive n-ACP-cit and the biodegradable and biocompatible PAA copolymer. Its basic structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, the degradability, bioactivity, biocompatibility, and osteoconductivity of n-ACP-cit/PAA composite were evaluated in vitro and in vivo, using simulated body fluid (SBF) solution soaking test, mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells proliferation and differentiation, morphological observation test, expression of genes associated with osteogenesis, and bone defect model repair test, respectively. The modified n-ACP-cit/PAA composite exhibited a much higher weight loss rate (36.01 wt.%) than that of PAA (23.99 wt.%) after immersing in SBF solution for 16 weeks and the pH values of local environment restored to neutral condition. Moreover, cells co-culturing with composites exhibited higher alkaline phosphatase activity, more calcium nodule-formation, and higher expression levels of osteogenic differentiation-related genes (Bmp-2, Colla I, OCN, OPN, and Runx-2) than that of PAA. Furthermore, the bone defect model repair test revealed that the composite could be intimately incorporated with the surrounding bone without causing any deleterious reaction and capable of guiding new bone formation. Together, these results indicated that the new modified bone repair n-ACP-cit/PAA composite material with specific characteristics may be designed for meeting diverse requirements from biomedical applications.
33477459/Characterization of a Novel Laccase LAC-Yang1 from White-Rot Fungus Pleurotus ostreatus Strain Yang1 with a Strong Ability to Degrade and Detoxify Chlorophenols In this study, a laccase LAC-Yang1 was successfully purified from a white-rot fungus strain Pleurotus ostreatus strain yang1 with high laccase activity. The enzymatic properties of LAC-Yang1 and its ability to degrade and detoxify chlorophenols such as 2,6-dichlorophenol and 2,3,6-trichlorophenol were systematically studied. LAC-Yang1 showed a strong tolerance to extremely acidic conditions and strong stability under strong alkaline conditions (pH 9-12). LAC-Yang1 also exhibited a strong tolerance to different inhibitors (EDTA, SDS), metal ions (Mn2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Al3+, Co2+, and metal ion mixtures), and organic solvents (glycerol, propylene glycol). LAC-Yang1 showed good stability in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, glycerol, and ethylene glycol. Our results reveal the strong degradation ability of this laccase for high concentrations of chlorophenols (especially 2,6-dichlorophenol) and chlorophenol mixtures (2,6-dichlorophenol + 2,3,6-trichlorophenol). LAC-Yang1 displayed a strong tolerance toward a variety of metal ions (Na2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, K+ and metal ion mixtures) and organic solvents (glycerol, ethylene glycol) in its degradation of 2,6-dichlorophenol and 2,3,6-trichlorophenol. The phytotoxicity of 2,6-dichlorophenol treated by LAC-Yang1 was significantly reduced or eliminated. LAC-Yang1 demonstrated a good detoxification effect on 2,6-dichlorophenol while degrading this compound. In conclusion, LAC-Yang1 purified from Pleurotus ostreatus has great application value and potential in environmental biotechnology, especially the efficient degradation and detoxification of chlorophenols.
33477445/Microwave-Assisted One-Pot Lipid Extraction and Glycolipid Production from Oleaginous Yeast Saitozyma podzolica in Sugar Alcohol-Based Media Glycolipids are non-ionic surfactants occurring in numerous products of daily life. Due to their surface-activity, emulsifying properties, and foaming abilities, they can be applied in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Enzymatic synthesis of glycolipids based on carbohydrates and free fatty acids or esters is often catalyzed using certain acyltransferases in reaction media of low water activity, e.g., organic solvents or notably Deep Eutectic Systems (DESs). Existing reports describing integrated processes for glycolipid production from renewables use many reaction steps, therefore this study aims at simplifying the procedure. By using microwave dielectric heating, DESs preparation was first accelerated considerably. A comparative study revealed a preparation time on average 16-fold faster than the conventional heating method in an incubator. Furthermore, lipids from robust oleaginous yeast biomass were successfully extracted up to 70% without using the pre-treatment method for cell disruption, limiting logically the energy input necessary for such process. Acidified DESs consisting of either xylitol or sorbitol and choline chloride mediated the one-pot process, allowing subsequent conversion of the lipids into mono-acylated palmitate, oleate, linoleate, and stearate sugar alcohol esters. Thus, we show strong evidence that addition of immobilized Candida antarctica Lipase B (Novozym 435 ), in acidified DES mixture, enables a simplified and fast glycolipid synthesis using directly oleaginous yeast biomass.
33467423/Effects of p-Synephrine during Exercise: A Brief Narrative Review The p-synephrine is the principal phytochemical found in bitter orange (Citrus aurantium). This substance is widely included in dietary supplements for weight loss/body fat reduction due to its potential benefits of increasing fat oxidation. For years, p-synephrine-containing dietary supplements have been marketed without proper knowledge of their true effectiveness to enhance fat utilization, especially when combined with exercise. However, the effects of p-synephrine on fat oxidation during exercise have been investigated in the last few years. The aim of the current discussion is to summarize the evidence on the effects of p-synephrine intake on fat oxidation and performance during exercise. Previous investigations have demonstrated that the acute intake of p-synephrine does not modify running sprint performance, jumping capacity, or aerobic capacity. However, the acute intake of p-synephrine, in a dose of 2-3 mg/kg of body mass, has been effective to enhance the rate of fat oxidation during incremental and continuous exercise. This effect has been observed in a range of exercise workloads between 30% and 80% of peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). The p-synephrine has the ability to increase the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise of increasing intensity without affecting the workload at which maximal fat oxidation is obtained (Fatmax). The effect of p-synephrine on fat oxidation is normally accompanied by a concomitant reduction of carbohydrate utilization during exercise, without modifying the energy expended during exercise. The shifting in substrate oxidation is obtained without any effect on heart rate during exercise and the prevalence of adverse effects is negligible. Thus, the acute use of p-synephrine, or p-synephrine-containing products, might offer some benefits for those individuals seeking higher fat utilization during exercise at low to moderate intensities. However, more research is still necessary to determine if the effect of p-synephrine on fat oxidation during exercise is maintained with chronic ingestion, in order to ascertain the utility of this substance in conjunction with exercise programs to produce an effective body fat/weight loss reduction.
33467753/Surface Plasmon Resonance Based on Molecularly Imprinted Polymeric Film for l-Phenylalanine Detection In this study, we designed a simple, rapid, sensitive and selective surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor for detection of L-phenylalaine by utilizing molecular imprinting technology. l-phenylalanine imprinted and non-imprinted poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-methacryloyl-l-phenylalanine) polymeric films were synthesized onto SPR chip surfaces using ultraviolet polymerization. l-phenyalanine imprinted and non-imprinted SPR sensors were characterized by using contact angle, atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry. After characterization studies, kinetic studies were carried out in the concentration range of 5.0-400.0 muM. The limit of detection and quantification were obtained as 0.0085 and 0.0285 muM, respectively. The response time for the test including equilibration, adsorption and desorption was approximately 9 min. The selectivity studies of the l-phenylalanine imprinted SPR sensor was performed in the presence of d-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan. Validation studies were carried out via enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis technique in order to demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the l-phenylalanine imprinted SPR sensor.
33466783/Endocrine-Disrupting Organochlorine Pesticides in Human Breast Milk: Changes during Lactation The aim of the present study was to assess infant safety associated with the occurrence of endocrine-disrupting organochlorine pesticides (OCP) in breast milk. Moreover, the association between pregnant mothers' dietary habits and these compounds levels in breast milk was investigated. Breast milk was collected at various stages of lactation. The samples were analyzed by the GC-MS method. The OCP concentrations ranged from < limit of detection (LOD) to 6.81 ng/g lipids. The highest OCP concentrations in breast milk occurred primarily within the first month of lactation, and decreased over the lactation period. It was found that the maternal consumption of certain food products:in particular pork, beef, poultry, eggs, and dairy products:could have affected the content of 1,1'-(2,2,2-Trichloroethane-1,1-diyl)bis(4-chlorobenzene), called DDT and its metabolites in the breast milk. The levels of beta-endosulfan were positively correlated with fish and poultry consumption. The redundancy analysis indicated that the diets of the pregnant women had an important impact on pesticide residues in the breast milk. There is a potential possibility of lowering the content of organochlorine compounds in breast milk by adhering to nutritional recommendations, e.g., avoiding the excessive consumption of fish and other raw food materials of unknown origin.
33467135/Differential Effects of DHA- and EPA-Rich Oils on Sleep in Healthy Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial Emerging evidence suggests that adequate intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), which include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), might be associated with better sleep quality. N-3 PUFAs, which must be acquired from dietary sources, are typically consumed at suboptimal levels in Western diets. Therefore, the current placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, investigated the effects of an oil rich in either DHA or EPA on sleep quality in healthy adults who habitually consumed low amounts of oily fish. Eighty-four participants aged 25-49 years completed the 26-week intervention trial. Compared to placebo, improvements in actigraphy sleep efficiency (p = 0.030) and latency (p = 0.026) were observed following the DHA-rich oil. However, these participants also reported feeling less energetic compared to the placebo (p = 0.041), and less rested (p = 0.017), and there was a trend towards feeling less ready to perform (p = 0.075) than those given EPA-rich oil. A trend towards improved sleep efficiency was identified in the EPA-rich group compared to placebo (p = 0.087), along with a significant decrease in both total time in bed (p = 0.032) and total sleep time (p = 0.019) compared to the DHA-rich oil. No significant effects of either treatment were identified for urinary excretion of the major melatonin metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. This study was the first to demonstrate some positive effects of dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs in healthy adult normal sleepers, and provides novel evidence showing the differential effects of n-3 PUFA supplements rich in either DHA or EPA. Further investigation into the mechanisms underpinning these observations including the effects of n-3 PUFAs on sleep architecture are required.
33467658/Management of Anaemia of Chronic Disease: Beyond Iron-Only Supplementation Chronic diseases are characterised by altered autophagy and protein metabolism disarrangement, resulting in sarcopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hypo-haemoglobinaemia. Hypo-haemoglobinaemia is linked to a worse prognosis independent of the target organ affected by the disease. Currently, the cornerstone of the therapy of anaemia is iron supplementation, with or without erythropoietin for the stimulation of haematopoiesis. However, treatment strategies should incorporate the promotion of the synthesis of heme, the principal constituent of haemoglobin (Hb) and of many other fundamental enzymes for human metabolism. Heme synthesis is controlled by a complex biochemical pathway. The limiting step of heme synthesis is D-amino-levulinic acid (D-ALA), whose availability and synthesis require glycine and succinil-coenzyme A (CoA) as precursor substrates. Consequently, the treatment of anaemia should not be based only on the sufficiency of iron but, also, on the availability of all precursor molecules fundamental for heme synthesis. Therefore, an adequate clinical therapeutic strategy should integrate a standard iron infusion and a supply of essential amino acids and vitamins involved in heme synthesis. We reported preliminary data in a select population of aged anaemic patients affected by congestive heart failure (CHF) and catabolic disarrangement, who, in addition to the standard iron therapy, were treated by reinforced therapeutic schedules also providing essential animo acids (AAs) and vitamins involved in the maintenance of heme. Notably, such individualised therapy resulted in a significantly faster increase in the blood concentration of haemoglobin after 30 days of treatment when compared to the nonsupplemented standard iron therapy.
33467454/Enhancement of Ketone Supplements-Evoked Effect on Absence Epileptic Activity by Co-Administration of Uridine in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk Rats Both uridine and exogenous ketone supplements decreased the number of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in a rat model of human absence epilepsy Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. It has been suggested that alleviating influence of both uridine and ketone supplements on absence epileptic activity may be modulated by A1 type adenosine receptors (A1Rs). The first aim was to determine whether intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a specific A1R antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX; 0.2 mg/kg) and a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist (7-(2-phenylethyl)-5-amino-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-c]pyrimidine) (SCH 58261; 0.5 mg/kg) have a modulatory influence on i.p. 1000 mg/kg uridine-evoked effects on SWD number in WAG/Rij rats. The second aim was to assess efficacy of a sub-effective dose of uridine (i.p. 250 mg/kg) combined with beta-hydroxybutyrate salt + medium chain triglyceride (KSMCT; 2.5 g/kg, gavage) on absence epilepsy. DPCPX completely abolished the i.p. 1000 mg/kg uridine-evoked alleviating effect on SWD number whereas SCH 58261 was ineffective, confirming the A1R mechanism. Moreover, the sub-effective dose of uridine markedly enhanced the effect of KSMCT (2.5 g/kg, gavage) on absence epileptic activity. These results demonstrate the anti-epilepsy benefits of co-administrating uridine and exogenous ketone supplements as a means to treat absence epilepsy.
33445770/Synthesis of Some New Folic Acid-Based Heterocycles of Anticipated Biological Activity To date, no fused heterocycles have been formed on folic acid molecules; for this reason, and others, our target is to synthesize new derivatives of folic acid as isolated or fused systems. Folic acid 1 reacted with ethyl pyruvate, triethyl orthoformate, ethyl chloroformate, thioformic acid hydrazide, and aldehydes to give new derivatives of folic acid 2-6a,b. Moreover, It reacted with benzylidene malononitrile, acetylacetone, ninhydrin, ethyl acetoacetate, ethyl cyanoacetate, and ethyl chloroacetate to give the pteridine fused systems 10-15, respectively. Ethoxycarbonylamino derivate 5 reacted with some nucleophiles containing the NH2 group, such as aminoguanidinium hydrocarbonate, hydrazine hydrate, glycine, thioformic acid hydrazide, and sulfa drugs in different conditions to give the urea derivatives 16-20a,b. Compound 4 reacted with the same nucleophiles to give the methylidene amino derivatives 21-24a,b. The fused compound 10 reacted with thioglycolic acid carbon disulfide, malononitrile, and formamide to give the four cyclic fused systems 25-30, respectively. The biological activity of some synthesized showed moderate effect against bacteria, but no effect shown towards fungi.
33466826/Prenatal and Postpartum Maternal Iodide Intake from Diet and Supplements, Urinary Iodine and Thyroid Hormone Concentrations in a Region of the United Kingdom with Mild-to-Moderate Iodine Deficiency Iodine is essential for normal thyroid function, supporting healthy fetal and child development. Iodine requirements increase in pregnancy, but many women in regions without salt iodization have insufficient intakes. We explored associations between iodide intake and urinary iodine concentration (UIC), urinary iodine/creatinine ratio (I/Cr), thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine and palpable goiter in a region of mild-to-moderate iodine insufficiency. A total of 246 pregnant women aged 18-40 in Bradford, UK, joined the Health and Iodine in Babies (Hiba) study. They provided detailed information on diet and supplement use, urine and serum samples and were assessed for goiter at around 12, 26 and 36 weeks' gestation, and 6, 18 and 30 weeks postpartum. Dietary iodide intake from food and drink was estimated using six 24 h recalls. During pregnancy, median (IQR) dietary iodide intake was 101 microg/day (54, 142), with 42% from dairy and 9% from white fish. Including supplements, intake was 143 microg/day (94, 196), with 49% < UK reference nutrient intake (140 microg/day). Women with Pakistani heritage had 129 microg/day (87, 190) median total intake. Total intake during pregnancy was associated with 4% (95% CI: 1%, 7%) higher UIC, 5% (3%, 7%) higher I/Cr, 4% (2%, 6%) lower thyroglobulin and 21% (9%, 32%) lower odds of palpable goiter per 50 microg/day. This cohort consumed less iodide in pregnancy than UK and World Health Organization dietary recommendations. UIC, I/Cr and thyroglobulin were associated with intake. Higher intake was associated with fewer goiters. Because dairy was the dominant source of iodide, women following plant-based or low-dairy diets may be at particular risk of iodine insufficiency.
33467123/Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LCPUFAs) and the Developing Immune System: A Narrative Review The immune system is complex: it involves many cell types and numerous chemical mediators. An immature immune response increases susceptibility to infection, whilst imbalances amongst immune components leading to loss of tolerance can result in immune-mediated diseases including food allergies. Babies are born with an immature immune response. The immune system develops in early life and breast feeding promotes immune maturation and protects against infections and may protect against allergies. The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are considered to be important components of breast milk. AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA are also present in the membranes of cells of the immune system and act through multiple interacting mechanisms to influence immune function. The effects of AA and of mediators derived from AA are often different from the effects of the n-3 LCPUFAs (i.e., EPA and DHA) and of mediators derived from them. Studies of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs in pregnant women show some effects on cord blood immune cells and their responses. These studies also demonstrate reduced sensitisation of infants to egg, reduced risk and severity of atopic dermatitis in the first year of life, and reduced persistent wheeze and asthma at ages 3 to 5 years, especially in children of mothers with low habitual intake of n-3 LCPUFAs. Immune markers in preterm and term infants fed formula with AA and DHA were similar to those in infants fed human milk, whereas those in infants fed formula without LCPUFAs were not. Infants who received formula plus LCPUFAs (both AA and DHA) showed a reduced risk of allergic disease and respiratory illness than infants who received standard formula. Studies in which infants received n-3 LCPUFAs report immune differences from controls that suggest better immune maturation and they show lower risk of allergic disease and respiratory illness over the first years of life. Taken together, these findings suggest that LCPUFAs play a role in immune development that is of clinical significance, particularly with regard to allergic sensitisation and allergic manifestations including wheeze and asthma.
33445451/Sulforaphane Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis via Suppression of the Autophagic Pathway Previous studies have demonstrated that sulforaphane (SFN) is a promising agent against osteoclastic bone destruction. However, the mechanism underlying its anti-osteoclastogenic activity is still unclear. Herein, for the first time, we explored the potential role of autophagy in SFN-mediated anti-osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We established an osteoclastogenesis model using receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand (RANKL)-induced RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining showed the formation of osteoclasts. We observed autophagosomes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro, we found that SFN inhibited osteoclastogenesis (number of osteoclasts: 22.67 +- 0.88 in the SFN (0) group vs. 20.33 +- 1.45 in the SFN (1 muM) group vs. 13.00 +- 1.00 in the SFN (2.5 muM) group vs. 6.66 +- 1.20 in the SFN (2.5 muM) group), decreased the number of autophagosomes, and suppressed the accumulation of several autophagic proteins in osteoclast precursors. The activation of autophagy by rapamycin (RAP) almost reversed the SFN-elicited anti-osteoclastogenesis (number of osteoclasts: 22.67 +- 0.88 in the control group vs. 13.00 +- 1.00 in the SFN group vs. 17.33 +- 0.33 in the SFN+RAP group). Furthermore, Western blot (WB) analysis revealed that SFN inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The JNK activator anisomycin significantly promoted autophagy, whereas the inhibitor SP600125 markedly suppressed autophagic activation in pre-osteoclasts. Microcomputed tomography (CT), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to analyze the results in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro results, we found that the administration of SFN could decrease the number of osteoclasts and the expression of autophagic light chain 3 (LC3) and protect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced calvarial erosion. Our findings highlight autophagy as a crucial mechanism of SFN-mediated anti-osteoclastogenesis and show that the JNK signaling pathway participates in this process.
33477344/Influence of the Electrolyte Salt Concentration on DNA Detection with Graphene Transistors Liquid-gated Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFET) are ultrasensitive bio-detection platforms carrying out the graphene's exceptional intrinsic functionalities. Buffer and dilution factor are prevalent strategies towards the optimum performance of the GFETs. However, beyond the Debye length (lambdaD), the role of the graphene-electrolytes' ionic species interactions on the DNA behavior at the nanoscale interface is complicated. We studied the characteristics of the GFETs under different ionic strength, pH, and electrolyte type, e.g., phosphate buffer (PB), and phosphate buffer saline (PBS), in an automatic portable built-in system. The electrostatic gating and charge transfer phenomena were inferred from the field-effect measurements of the Dirac point position in single-layer graphene (SLG) transistors transfer curves. Results denote that lambdaD is not the main factor governing the effective nanoscale screening environment. We observed that the longer lambdaD was not the determining characteristic for sensitivity increment and limit of detection (LoD) as demonstrated by different types and ionic strengths of measuring buffers. In the DNA hybridization study, our findings show the role of the additional salts present in PBS, as compared to PB, in increasing graphene electron mobility, electrostatic shielding, intermolecular forces and DNA adsorption kinetics leading to an improved sensitivity.
33467004/Biological Activity of High-Purity beta-1,3-1,6-Glucan Derived from the Black Yeast Aureobasidium pullulans: A Literature Review The black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans produces abundant soluble beta-1,3-1,6-glucan:a functional food ingredient with known health benefits. For use as a food material, soluble beta-1,3-1,6-glucan is produced via fermentation using sucrose as the carbon source. Various functionalities of beta-1,3-1,6-glucan have been reported, including its immunomodulatory effect, particularly in the intestine. It also exhibits antitumor and antimetastatic effects, alleviates influenza and food allergies, and relieves stress. Moreover, it reduces the risk of lifestyle-related diseases by protecting the intestinal mucosa, reducing fat, lowering postprandial blood glucose, promoting bone health, and healing gastric ulcers. Furthermore, it induces heat shock protein 70. Clinical studies have reported the antiallergic and triglyceride-reducing effects of beta-1,3-1,6-glucan, which are indicators of improvement in lifestyle-related diseases. The primary and higher-order structures of beta-1,3-1,6-glucan have been elucidated. Specifically, it comprises a single highly-branched glucose residue with the beta-1,6 bond (70% or more) on a backbone of glucose with 1,3-beta bonds. beta-Glucan shows a triple helical structure, and studies on its use as a drug delivery system have been actively conducted. beta-Glucan in combination with anti-inflammatory substances or fullerenes can be used to target macrophages. Based on its health functionality, beta-1,3-1,6-glucan is an interesting material as both food and medicine.
33477507/Exploitation of HPLC Analytical Method for Simultaneous Determination of Six Principal Unsaturated Fatty Acids in Oviductus Ranae Based on Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Components by Single-Marker (QAMS) As one of the featured products in northeast China, Oviductus Ranae has been widely used as a nutritious food, which contains a variety of bioactive unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). It is necessary to establish a scientific and reliable determination method of UFA contents in Oviductus Ranae. In this work, six principal UFAs in Oviductus Ranae, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (ARA), linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA), were identified using UPLC-MS/MS. The UFAs identified in Oviductus Ranae were further separated based on the optimized RP-HPLC conditions. Quantitative analysis of multi-components by single-marker (QAMS) method was implemented in content determination of EPA, ALA, DHA, ARA and OA, where LA was used as the internal standard. The experiments based on Taguchi design verified the robustness of the QAMS method on different HPLC instruments and chromatographic columns. The QAMS and external standard method (ESM) were used to calculate the UFA content of 15 batches of Oviductus Ranae samples from different regions. The relative error (r < 0.73%) and cosine coefficient showed that the two methods obtained similar contents, and the method validations met the requirements. The results showed that QAMS can comprehensively and effectively control the quality of UFAs in Oviductus Ranae which provides new ideas and solutions for studying the active components in Oviductus Ranae.
33352829/Ketogenic Diet: Impact on Cellular Lipids in Hippocampal Murine Neurons Background: The mechanism of action of the ketogenic diet (KD), an effective treatment for pharmacotherapy refractory epilepsy, is not fully elucidated. The present study examined the effects of two metabolites accumulating under KD:beta-hydroxybutyrate (ssHB) and decanoic acid (C10) in hippocampal murine (HT22) neurons. Methods: A mouse HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line was used in the present study. Cellular lipids were analyzed in cell cultures incubated with high (standard) versus low glucose supplemented with ssHB or C10. Cellular cholesterol was analyzed using HPLC, while phospholipids and sphingomyelin (SM) were analyzed using HPTLC. Results: HT22 cells showed higher cholesterol, but lower SM levels in the low glucose group without supplements as compared to the high glucose groups. While cellular cholesterol was reduced in both ssHB- and C10-incubated cells, phospholipids were significantly higher in C10-incubated neurons. Ratios of individual phospholipids to cholesterol were significantly higher in ssHB- and C10-incubated neurons as compared to controls. Conclusion: Changes in the ratios of individual phospholipids to cholesterol in HT22 neurons suggest a possible alteration in the composition of the plasma membrane and organelle membranes, which may provide insight into the working mechanism of KD metabolites ssHB and C10.
33407148/The NAC-type transcription factor CaNAC46 regulates the salt and drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana Background The NAC (NAM, ATAF1/ATAF2, and CUC2) transcription factors belong to a large family of plant-specific transcription factors in monocot and dicot species. These transcription factors regulate the expression of stress tolerance-related genes that protect plants from various abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, and low temperatures. Results In this study, we identified the CaNAC46 transcription factor gene in Capsicum annuum. Its open reading frame was revealed to comprise 921 bp, encoding a protein consisting of 306 amino acids, with an isoelectric point of 6.96. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that CaNAC46 belongs to the ATAF subfamily. The expression of CaNAC46 was induced by heat, cold, high salt, drought, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate treatments. Thus, CaNAC46 may be important for the resistance of dry pepper to abiotic stresses. A subcellular localization analysis confirmed that CaNAC46 is localized in the nucleus. The overexpression of CaNAC46 improved the tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants to drought and salt stresses. The CaNAC46-overexpressing lines had longer roots and more lateral roots than wild-type lines under prolonged drought and high salt stress conditions. Additionally, CaNAC46 affected the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, CaNAC46 promoted the expression of SOD, POD, RD29B, RD20, LDB18, ABI, IAA4, and P5CS. The malondialdehyde contents were higher in TRV2-CaNAC46 lines than in wild-type plants in response to drought and salt stresses. Furthermore, the expression levels of stress-responsive genes, such as ABA2, P5CS, DREB, RD22, CAT, and POD, were down-regulated in TRV2-CaNAC46 plants. Conclusions Under saline and drought conditions, CaNAC46 is a positive regulator that activates ROS-scavenging enzymes and enhances root formation. The results of our study indicate CaNAC46 is a transcriptional regulator responsible for salinity and drought tolerance and suggest the abiotic stress-related gene regulatory mechanisms controlling this NAC transcription factor are conserved between A. thaliana and pepper.
